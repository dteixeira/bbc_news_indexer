      <body>Two charred bodies pulled from Kenya's Westgate shopping centre on Thursday are "highly likely" to be two of the attackers, an MP has told the BBC. Ndung'u Gethenji, chairman of the committee investigating the attack, said AK47 rifles used by the militants were found next to the bodies. The authorities will now conduct forensic tests on the bodies. At least 67 people died when suspected al-Shabab militants stormed the Nairobi shopping centre on 21 September. The attack sparked a four-day siege in which large parts of the shopping centre were destroyed. The Kenyan authorities have released the names, or nicknames, of four suspects in the attack, but have given few other details. The Kenya Red Cross lists 23 people as still missing. Mr Gethenji said the bodies recovered on Thursday were likely to be militants because the army does not use AK47s. He said another body recovered from the rubble was likely to be a soldier. It is still not clear whether some of the attackers might have escaped, or even how many attackers there were. Officials initially said 10 to 15 gunmen were involved, but CCTV footage appears to show only four militants. The BBC's Newsnight programme has revealed that one of the suspected attackers is a 23-year-old Somalia-born Norwegian national, Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow. His family fled to Norway in the 1990s, but he returned to Somalia in 2009 and allegedly joined the Somali militant group. Sources in al-Shabab have told the BBC Somali Service that Dhuhulow attended a training camp in El Bur in central Somalia, one of the militants' main bases. The sources said Dhuhulow took part in many al-Shabab operations in Mogadishu and Kismayo and was well-known in jihadist circles. Journalist Zubayr Roble in Oslo told the BBC that Dhuhulow frequented the Towfiq Mosque in the Norwegian capital. Mr Roble said Somalis at the mosque for Friday prayers were in shock about the revelations and anxious over the possible implications the case could have for the Somali community in Norway. Martin Bernsen, an officer in Norway's Security Service, told the BBC's World At One programme that Norwegian authorities had opened an investigation into the involvement of a Norwegian citizen in the attack "about one week ago". "We are trying to find out his role and what his connections are. We don't know if he alive or if he is dead." When asked if the authorities had previously been aware of any previous similar activity among Somalis in Norway, Mr Bernsen said; "It's not the Somalis we're worried about, it's the criminal element. "We are aware that there are some activities. We have challenges in Norway regarding both al-Shabab and al-Qaeda. Al-Shabab was first known in Norway in 2007 when we investigated money transfer to al-Shabab". Mr Bernsen said Norwegian authorities were also concerned about people travelling to "conflict areas", including Syria and Somalia, particularly in the past year. The BBC's Will Ross in Nairobi says Kenyans still feel there are a lot of unanswered questions, and will be shocked if it turns out that just four gunmen caused such havoc. The Somali militant group al-Shabab said its members staged the attack in response to Kenya's army carrying out operations on Somali territory. There are about 4,000 Kenyan troops in the south of Somalia, where they have been fighting the militants since 2011. Uganda also has troops in Somalia, and the authorities have issued an alert and stepped up security after the US embassy warned of reports of a possible "Westgate-style attack" in Kampala. The Ugandan police said in a tweet: "Stay alert and watch each other's steps and activities, as we are still threatened by terror." Al-Shabab has carried out attacks in Kampala before, most notoriously a double suicide-attack that killed more than 70 people in 2010. Meanwhile, several British Muslims have been put under police protection because of a "credible threat" against them. Al-Shabab militants apparently singled out Mohammed Ansar and other Muslim commentators in a video that condemned those who spoke out against extremism. The Islamist group, which is believed to have between 7,000 and 9,000 fighters, controls large parts of Somalia. Al-Shabab is fighting to create an Islamic state in Somalia and is banned as a terrorist group by both the US and the UK, </body>

      <title>Death home saw 'institutional abuse'</title>
      <description>Institutionalised abuse took place at Orchid View, the Crawley care home that saw 19 unexplained deaths, a coroner says.</description>

      <body>A care home where 19 residents died was riddled with "institutionalised abuse", a coroner has said. Penelope Schofield has ruled neglect contributed to five of the deaths, at Orchid View in Copthorne, near Crawley. The West Sussex coroner said the home, then run by Southern Cross, was "mismanaged and understaffed". Ms Schofield has also criticised the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which gave the home a "good" rating in 2010, a year before it closed down. A serious case review has now begun into the elderly residents' deaths. At the final day of a five-week inquest into the deaths, which were all "unexplained", Mrs Schofield said the problems at the home were from the top down and started at an early stage, but nobody did anything to address them. Orchid View has since reopened under a new name and new management. Ms Schofield said it was "disgraceful" Southern Cross was allowed to run the home in the way it was, for about two years. Referring to the CQC's rating of the home, she said: "I question how this could be the case and I question whether the inspection that did take place was fit for purpose. "It's a heartbreaking case. We all have parents who will probably need care in the latter part of their lives." Andrea Sutcliffe, the CQC's chief inspector of adult social care, said she had ordered a "root-and-branch review" of the organisation's actions in relation to Orchid View. While summing up, Ms Schofield said she had found that medical documents for resident Jean Halfpenny, 77, were falsified and that she was given too much of the blood-thinning drug warfarin. Home manager Meera Reed had earlier denied ordering staff to shred documents and filling in new forms to cover up the overdose. Continuing, the coroner said that another resident was found naked and in pain with his catheter twisted, while a family member found staff eating toast and drinking tea with their feet up. Whistleblower Lisa Martin, who first informed police of problems at Orchid View, said she felt she had no choice but to come forward. Speaking outside the inquest, she said: "I had witnessed too much poor management and care to vulnerable adults. "I couldn't live with the knowledge any longer and felt I had no choice but to tell the police." She said she knew she had done the right thing morally, but said she had not worked for two years and the case had had a huge impact on her life. Speaking of her former colleagues, she said: "They shouldn't be allowed to work in the industry." During the inquest, the coroner also said it was a cause for concern that many people who worked at Orchid View were still working in the industry. Ms Martin said when Mrs Halfpenny had to be admitted to hospital, Ms Reed looked at her forms and said: "We can't send her to hospital with those. They will shut us down." She said other forms were filled out and she was asked not to disclose the shredding of the original documents to anyone. She added that the final straw came when she was told by a nurse they had found 28 drug errors from just one night shift. She called the police who arrived the next day. Ms Schofield said that all 19 residents whose deaths were unexplained had suffered "sub-optimal" care. She said they had all died of natural causes but the deaths of 86-year-old Enid Trodden, 85-year-olds Wilfred Gardner and John Holmes, and 77-year-olds Margaret Tucker and Jean Halfpenny "had been attributed to by neglect". After the hearing, Mrs Halfpenny's daughter, Linzi Collings, said the horrific details that had emerged were beyond comprehension. She said: "How the corporate failings of Southern Cross could create these events and how such terrible standards could go unnoticed by the authorities for so long has left us baffled." She said her mother deserved to be treated with dignity and compassion, but Orchid View failed to provide her with even basic care, despite being paid a significant amount of money. Lawyers for some families have called for a public inquiry to be set up, but the coroner said she would await the outcome of the serious case review first. Ian Christian, of Irwin Mitchell solicitors, which represented seven families, said the situation at Orchid View raised questions about the quality of care provided across the industry. He said before Southern Cross closed, it had owned 752 care homes. "The evidence revealed in this inquest is deeply concerning as it shows signs of profits being put before the well-being of residents," he said. Amanda Rogers, director of adult services for West Sussex County Council, said the inquest showed a shocking example of poor care, but such examples were "isolated" and the public should "remain confident" about the levels of care in West Sussex. The CQC's Ms Sutcliffe said she was shocked at the descriptions of care at Orchid View in 2010 and 2011. She said it was "completely unacceptable" and lessons needed to be learned. She added that she would "personally oversee a root-and-branch review of our actions". Ms Sutcliffe said she had already outlined changes to how care homes would inspected, monitored and regulated in the future. </body>

      <title>SNP pledges energy bill cut post Yes</title>
      <description>Scotland's deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon unveils plans to cut energy bills by 5% a year in an independent Scotland.</description>

      <body>Scotland's deputy first minister has unveiled plans to cut energy bills by about 5% a year if the country votes for independence. Nicola Sturgeon told the SNP's conference in Perth the reduction of about £70 would be achieved by removing a number of "green" charges. She believed the measure would not be a short-term fix, but a "real and lasting cut". People in Scotland vote in an independence referendum next year. On Thursday, 18 September, 2014, they will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?" Ms Sturgeon explained that two schemes worth up to half of the green costs imposed on energy companies would be removed from the bills of consumers. The minister told the party's annual gathering: "Right now, the Scottish government invests around £80m a year on energy efficiency schemes to help meet our climate change targets and lower the costs of energy bills. "A further £120m comes from a scheme designed in Westminster, operated through energy companies and paid for by a levy on your gas and electricity bills. "It is a disjointed approach, it doesn't take account of Scottish priorities and it's not as efficient as it could be." Ms Sturgeon went on to announce that an SNP government in an independent Scotland would remove the energy saving measures and the warm home discount from energy bills. She said the current system would be replaced by a more joined-up approach with funding for fuel poverty schemes - worth up to £200m per year - coming directly from government. Ms Sturgeon added: "Independence will allow us to tackle fuel poverty much more directly, delivering Scottish solutions to Scottish problems, and ensuring that energy companies always behave in a socially responsible way to protect vulnerable customers." She insisted the energy schemes would be delivered more effectively and it would save hard-pressed consumers money. The SNP deputy leader told the conference: "We estimate that it will cut energy bills by around 5% - or £70 a year. "Not a short-term measure - but a real and lasting cut in Scottish energy bills." The minister went on to demand that the coalition government at Westminster ditch its spare room subsidy, which is described by critics as the ''bedroom tax''. But she said if it refused to act, the current Scottish government would allocate "up to £20m" for a second year to help those who have been affected. Ms Sturgeon also announced that the Holyrood administration would fund the Poverty Alliance to deliver a Living Wage Accreditation Scheme to "promote the living wage and increase the number of private companies that pay it". Turning to the issue of health, Ms Sturgeon said a UK-wide approach "would be the worst thing that could ever happen to the Scottish NHS". She added: "Westminster privatisation of the NHS is not wanted in Scotland. "Scotland's national health service is staying in public hands." Ms Sturgeon went on to warn that Westminster MPs in all the UK parties were "itching to abolish the Barnett formula and cut Scotland's share of spending". She said: "So, I say this to everyone yet to make up their mind [on independence]. Consider carefully the arguments for a Yes vote. Subject them to scrutiny and ask the tough questions. "But do not ever let anyone pull the wool over your eyes about the consequences of a No vote. "They are clear and they are real. Scotland's social security system will be dismantled; Scotland's public services and universal benefits will be under threat and Scotland's budget will be cut. "The risks of a No vote are real." Ms Sturgeon promised that the Scottish government's White Paper on independence, which is due to be published next month, would "answer all your questions". She added: "The White Paper will be Scotland's detailed guide to independence. "It will make the positive case. It will explain the process by which we will become independent and describe how our newly independent country will work. "It will set out the gains of independence for you, your family and for your community." Towards the end of her speech, Ms Sturgeon said: "The vote in 2014 is not a vote for or against the SNP. "It is a vote for or against the power to take decisions in Scotland." She insisted that an SNP government after independence would bring the mail service back into public ownership; reverse welfare reforms; protect state pensions and get rid of Trident nuclear weapons. </body>

      <title>Biggest petrol price fall since 2008</title>
      <description>The AA says petrol prices have recorded their biggest monthly fall since 2008, taking the average cost of a litre of fuel to 132.16p.</description>

      <body>The AA says petrol prices have recorded their biggest fall since 2008, taking the average cost to 132.16p a litre. The motorists' lobby group said average petrol prices fell 5.49p a litre between mid-September and mid-October, the biggest monthly fall since prices fell 11.5p in November 2008. The price of diesel has fallen from 142.50p a litre to 139.12p. The AA said lower wholesale fuel prices had prompted the price drop, but warned that further falls were unlikely. The organisation says the recent drop in prices means the cost of filling up the tank of a small petrol car has fallen by £2.74, while a larger vehicle, such as a Ford Mondeo, would cost £3.84 less to refuel. Northern Ireland is the most expensive place for petrol, with an average pump price of £132.9p a litre, and London, the north of England, and Yorkshire and Humberside are the joint cheapest at 131.9p. Scotland is still the most expensive for diesel at 140.1p a litre, while London is the cheapest at 138.6p. Regional variations depend on whether an area is mainly urban - in which case there is more competition - or if it is mainly rural - in which case suppliers have higher transport costs and there is less competition. Overall, the AA says the UK has the seventh-highest petrol price and the second-highest diesel price in Europe. The fuel price data is supplied by the research firm Experian Catalist. The AA said further falls in petrol prices were unlikely, because of poor refinery capacity in the UK and the likely strengthening of the US dollar. The US dollar is expected to rise in value now that the standoff over the country's budget is over and oil is priced in dollars. The AA's president, Edmund King, said: "A more than £2.50-a-tank cut in petrol costs for families is a dramatic improvement on its own. But, heading into winter with cars using more fuel, the timing couldn't be better. "Alongside Asda, Sainsbury's decision to fully reflect the fall in wholesale prices has been a huge benefit for drivers and businesses. "However, the AA is also encouraged by the growing band of non-supermarket retailers challenging the pricing of other supermarkets whose prices in many places are far less generous," he added. The organisation said that the situation at the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland, where a dispute between management and unions has led to a temporary closure, had highlighted the UK's lack of refinery capacity. It urged the government to find ways to support domestic refineries. </body>

      <title>Hunt highlights plight of the lonely</title>
      <description>It is a source of "national shame" that as many as 800,000 people in England are "chronically lonely", Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt says.</description>

      <body>It is a source of "national shame" that as many as 800,000 people in England are "chronically lonely", Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. In a speech, Mr Hunt highlighted the "problem of loneliness that in our busy lives we have utterly failed to confront as a society". "Some five million people say television is their main form of company," he said. Labour accused of him trying to blame families for government failures. In a speech at the National Children and Adults Services (NCAS) conference, Mr Hunt said: "Each and every lonely person has someone who could visit them and offer companionship. "A forgotten million who live amongst us - ignored to our national shame." He added: "According to the Campaign to End Loneliness, there are 800,000 people in England who are chronically lonely." He also told delegates that the 112,000 cases of alleged abuse in care homes referred by English councils in 2012-13, the majority involving over-65s, indicated that "something is badly wrong". But the regulation of care in both the private and public sector was improving, he argued. The Conservative MP said the new chief inspector of social care, Andrea Sutcliffe, would start to give ratings to care homes from April 2014, with a view to organising inspections of all 25,000 care homes by 2016. Mr Hunt said he was "particularly worried" about the 400,000 people in care homes - some of whom get regular visits, but others who were just "parked there". He said that 46% of people aged 80 or over reported feeling lonely "some of the time or often". He warned that loneliness was as "bad for you" as "smoking 15 cigarettes a day", was "worse than obesity" because of the risk of blood clots, heart disease and dementia, and warned that lonely people "drink more" and are more prone to early admission in residential or nursing care. Mr Hunt also said he believed the UK should learn from Asian cultures, where there was "reverence and respect for older people" and "residential care is a last rather than a first option". "The social contract is stronger because as children see how their own grandparents are looked after, they develop higher expectations of how they too will be treated when they get old," he explained. "If we are to tackle the challenge of an ageing society, we must learn from this - and restore and reinvigorate the social contract between generations. "And uncomfortable though it is to say it, it will only start with changes in the way we personally treat our own parents and grandparents." England should aim to become "the best place in the world to grow old in", he concluded. But Labour said the "real national shame" was "Jeremy Hunt's attempt to shift the blame for dealing with the very real problems of loneliness amongst elderly people on to families alone". Shadow health and social care minister Liz Kendall said: "He seems completely unaware that there are over six million unpaid family carers in Britain today, one in five of whom provide more than 50 hours care a week for their loved ones. "These unsung heroes save the taxpayer billions of pounds yet often get precious little support in return. "Families, friends and neighbours need a decent care system to back up their efforts to look after elderly people, but the reality is our care system is in crisis and has been pushed to the brink of collapse. "Jeremy Hunt and David Cameron need to take responsibly for their government's actions rather than trying to turn the clock back and say it's down to families alone." Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said on Twitter that Jeremy Hunt was "right to highlight isolation of older people". He added: "But he can't get away from fact that Govt cuts to care have made it much worse." But speaking on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Anthea Tinker, professor of social gerontology at King's College in London, said it was a "myth" that eastern Asian families placed greater reverence on families and older people than in the West. "The reality is that with one-child-families, children have often moved to a city or emigrated," she said. "So it's just not practical for families to depend on their children. One of the largest nursing homes in the world is about to open in China, for 5,000 people, which is amazing." Prof Tinker added: "We've got to look at the reality rather than the myth." </body>

      <body>Australian fire fighters are battling a series of major wildfires in New South Wales, with fears that hundreds of homes have been destroyed. The blazes are continuing to burn on the outskirts of Sydney, despite the easing of temperatures and winds. One man has died while trying to protect his home. Prime Minister Tony Abbott visited Winmalee in the Blue Mountains, one of the areas worst-hit by the fires, around 70km (45 miles) west of Sydney. Correspondents say bushfires are common in Australia but they have come earlier than normal this year, sparking concerns of further problems to come. Minister for Police and Emergency Services Michael Gallacher told the BBC that "the speed and the ferocity" of the fires was something "not seen for many, many years". "We had one fire front that changed direction and had a front to it, so if you can imagine, burning in one direction 25km [15 miles] wide." "We're only now in the process of being able to return to some of the sites to check the magnitude of the losses and I've got to say, it's going to be quite substantial," he added. Hundreds of residents spent Thursday night in evacuation centres, with many returning home to find their houses razed. Fire fighters described blazes as tall as 20m to 30m (100ft). A 63-year-old man died from a heart attack as he tried to defend his home in Lake Munmorah, in the Central Coast region of NSW, on Thursday afternoon. Around 2,000 fire fighters across the state worked to try and contain the fires but many are still burning out of control, says the BBC's Jon Donnison. Mr Abbott, in Winmalee, said of those helping to battle the fires: "These are ordinary people who, on an extraordinary day, come together to support their community and to protect their fellow Australians." At least three fire fighters have been reported injured. The NSW Rural Fire Service said an initial assessment of the Winmalee and Springwood areas showed that 81 properties had been destroyed, with 37 damaged. "Approximately 30% of the fireground has been assessed," it said. "The number of properties destroyed or damaged will rise." Reports estimate that as many as 200 homes could be lost in total. The fires have been caused by unseasonably hot temperatures and strong winds. While these have now died down, more hot weather is forecast next week. "It's been an awful 24 hours for the Blue Mountains [region]," Mayor Mark Greenhill told Nine Network Television. "We've lost possibly scores of homes." Ron Fuller, who lost his home in Winmalee, told ABC News: "We've had a number of fires through here before but this was an extraordinary fire. The speed was extraordinary, it just raced through this whole area, took out some houses, left other ones standing." Jodie Harrison, Mayor of Lake Macquarie, said that four heritage homes, as well as a historic jetty, were caught in the fire. "It's been confirmed that four houses in the heritage village of Catherine Hill Bay have been lost," she told local media. NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell, in an interview on broadcaster 7 News, called the fires "some of the worst we have experienced around Sydney in living memory". "We're in for a long, tough summer," he added. Alex Chesser, a District Officer with the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, told the BBC that the fires had come unusually early. "It's... a combination of a couple years of quite wet summers and winters which have allowed the bush to continue to grow at high rates, and also prevented us undertaking as many hazard reduction burns as we'd like," he said. Smoke and ash from the wildfires blanketed the Sydney skyline on Thursday. New South Wales was also hit by bush fires in September, which injured several fire fighters.

      <body>Sun journalist Nick Parker and a second man will be charged by police over the theft of an MP's mobile phone in 2010. Mr Parker, 52, from south-west London, is accused of one count of receiving stolen goods and one of unauthorised access to computer material. Michael Ankers, 29, from south-west London, faces one count of theft of a phone belonging to Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh. Both men will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 6 November. Gregor McGill, a lawyer at the Crown Prosecution Service, said there was insufficient evidence to charge another suspect in relation to the case. Ms McDonagh, who has represented Mitcham and Morden since 1997, had her mobile phone stolen from her car in Colliers Wood in south-west London on 17 October 2010. The accusations against Parker and Ankers bring to three the number of people charged under Operation Tuleta, a Scotland Yard investigation focused on computer hacking and other alleged privacy breaches. Operation Tuleta began in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. It is being run by the Metropolitan Police alongside Operation Elveden, which is an investigation into inappropriate payments to public officials, and Operation Weeting, the Met's phone-hacking inquiry. Mr Parker has already been charged with three counts of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office over payments to officials. The Independent Police Complaints Commission has also made three arrests under inquiries linked to the investigations. </body>

      <description>Business Secretary Vince Cable defends the 330p flotation price of Royal Mail on a day when shares in the company briefly touched £5.</description>

      <body>Business Secretary Vince Cable has defended the 330p flotation price of Royal Mail on a day when shares in the company briefly touched £5. Value for money was important, but it was "about more than just the level of proceeds received on day one" of the flotation, he said in a letter to MPs. Some big investors declined to invest in Royal Mail, while others were uneasy about possible strike action, he added. The remarks were made to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. In the letter, Mr Cable says the price was set to ensure a successful transaction, good value, the ability to sell off the remaining government stake in the business and it being able to access finance from the markets. The price range was determined using market testing which involved consulting with a core group of 20 investment institutions. It was also priced relative to comparable companies operating elsewhere in Europe. He said that the threat of industrial action by the postal workers' union was also a factor that influenced the initial price range. "There were some investors who stated that they were not willing to invest at all and many others who focused on the business and financial implications of strike action," Mr Cable said. The letter says it was the banks employed to coordinate the sale - Goldman Sachs and UBS - that recommended the 260p to 330p price range for the shares. This was also endorsed by the government's independent adviser, the investment bank Lazard. The consultation process with investors, known as "pilot fishing", revealed that there would be sufficient demand for shares at the bottom of the range, even with the threat of industrial action. A slightly lower upper end for the price range was initially recommended. That was subsequently revised upwards "following ongoing positive feedback", he said. The final 330p float price was agreed based on final demand indications. It was endorsed by Lazard. The investment bank has now been asked to appear before the BIS Select committee amid concerns that Royal Mail was sold off too cheaply. When it became clear the share offer was many times oversubscribed (20 times for the institutional offer, seven times for the retail offer) the government did consider revising the price upwards. But this was not done "based on an assessment of the composition of demand... and an assessment of where demand would taper off," Mr Cable writes. There was also a view that this would introduce an "execution risk" to the sell off. Mr Cable said the banks helping with the sell off "recommended against increasing the price range; this advice was endorsed by Lazard". The letter does not address why the current price of Royal Mail has gone so high. But its understood the government believes this is down to the scarcity of shares available. It also believes hedge funds - some from the US - may be buying at this elevated price in the belief that Royal Mail may be transformed and modernised quicker than anticipated. </body>

      <body>British Muslims who speak out against extremism are being warned that they could be targeted by members of the Somali militant group al-Shabab. British Muslim commentator Mohammed Ansar said he was currently under police protection because of what he was told was a "credible threat". It comes after al-Shabab militants posted a video online which named Muslims who have criticised jihadists. Scotland Yard said it was investigating the video. The hour-long film, called The Woolwich Attack: An Eye for an Eye, is narrated by an unidentified man with a British accent. It praises the killing of the soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, south-east London, on 22 May, and includes footage of Mr Ansar and other Muslims condemning the attack. Mr Ansar said he was visited by police and given protection earlier this week. The imam and broadcaster Ajmal Masroor said he had also had a late night visit from two detectives after he was named in the film. He said police warned him they had credible evidence of a potential threat against him. But Mr Masroor told the BBC he would not be silenced and would continue to speak out against terrorism and extremism. Scotland Yard confirmed it had spoken to a number of individuals and said it was currently assessing the contents of the video. At least 67 people died when suspected al-Shabab militants stormed Kenya's Westgate shopping centre on 21 September. Al-Shabab is fighting to create an Islamic state in Somalia and is banned as a terrorist group by both the US and the UK. The Islamist group, which is believed to have between 7,000 and 9,000 fighters, controls large parts of Somalia. </body>

      <body>A planned five-hour strike by firefighters in England and Wales has been called off, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has said. The union said the decision came after progress in talks over pensions - the strike had been due to take place from 18:30 until 23:30 BST on Saturday. The government wants firefighters to work up to 60 but the union says this is too old to be fighting fires. The FBU said it had been presented with a deal similar to that in Scotland. This means firefighters will be able to retire on a full pension between the the ages of 55 and 60 if they are genuinely not fit enough and another role cannot be found for them. A member of staff who does meet the fitness standards and chooses to retire early will get a reduced pension. A final agreement has not yet been reached because negotiations will need to take place between ministers and individual fire authorities about how this will be funded. Firefighters in Scotland voted against a strike. The FBU said 32,000 union members in England and Wales walked out for four hours when it staged a first round of action last month. Contingency plans at the 46 fire services in England and three in Wales included using part-time and volunteer firefighters, calling in non-union fire crews and bringing in private contractors. The armed forces had a back-up role and in the event of a major incident union members could have returned to work. No major incidents were reported during the strike which was the first national walkout for a decade. </body>

      <description>Saudi Arabia turns down a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council, accusing the world body of "double standards".</description>

      <body>Saudi Arabia has turned down a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, accusing the world body of "double standards". The Saudi foreign ministry said the UN needs to be reformed first. It said the Security Council had failed in its duties towards Syria as well as in other world conflicts. Saudi Arabia has previously expressed frustration at what it sees as an international failure to act on Syria, where it staunchly backs the rebels. There has been no official reaction from the UN, but diplomats there expressed surprise at Riyadh's announcement. Russia's foreign ministry called the move bewildering, and said Saudi Arabia's criticism of the UN Security Council about its actions over Syria "is particularly strange". The announcement came hours after Saudi Arabia was elected for the first time to one of the 10 rotating seats on the Security Council. The non-permanent members sit on the council for two years, along with the five permanent members - the US, the UK, France, China and Russia. "Work mechanisms and double-standards on the Security Council prevent it from carrying out its duties and assuming its responsibilities in keeping world peace," the Saudi foreign ministry said in a statement. "Therefore Saudi Arabia... has no other option but to turn down Security Council membership until it is reformed and given the means to accomplish its duties and assume its responsibilities in preserving the world's peace and security," it added. The failure "to find a solution to the Palestinian cause for 65 years" had led to "numerous wars that have threatened world peace," the foreign ministry said. It also criticised the UN's "failure" to rid the Middle East region of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons. And it accused the UN of allowing the Syrian government "to kill its own people with chemical weapons... without confronting it or imposing any deterrent sanctions". The UN Security Council last month finally broke a two-and-a-half year deadlock on how to deal with conflict in Syria after voting unanimously to adopt a binding resolution on ridding the country of chemical weapons. Saudi observers say Riyadh would have been working for years to gain a place on the UN Security Council, so such a decision would have to have been made at the very top of the kingdom's leadership. One Security Council diplomat, quoted by AFP, said the announcement was "totally unexpected" and without precedent. Another said: "There was nothing controversial about the election. But the government has made it clear in recent weeks that it is concerned about Syria and the Palestine issue." </body>

      <title>PM backs 'illegal immigrant' texts</title>
      <description>David Cameron backs the 'principle' of sending warning text messages to suspected illegal immigrants - even though some have gone to the wrong people.</description>

      <body>David Cameron "agrees with the principle" of sending text messages suggesting the recipients are illegal immigrants, despite some going to the wrong people, his spokesman has said. The Home Office says just 14 people out of a total of 58,800 contacted were mistakenly asked if they had overstayed their visas. But campaigners say the true number of people wrongly contacted is far higher. Labour described the government's tactic as "shambolic and incompetent". Some people suspected of having outstayed their visas were sent a text reading: "Our records show you may not have leave to remain in the UK. Please contact us to discuss your case." The prime minister's official spokesman acknowledged that the wording of the texts had changed since the campaign began. Originally, they had included the phrase: "You are required to leave the UK as you no longer have the right to remain." The Home Office said it was "right to enforce the rules", and Mr Cameron's spokesman said: "The prime minister agrees with the principle of the texts. "It is one of various means the Home Office contacts people who may not have the right to remain in the UK." But two recipients of the texts - campaigner Suresh Grover and immigration lawyer Bobby Chan - reacted angrily to the message. "I came here with my parents in 1966, I was born in East Africa and have a British passport," Mr Grover told the Independent newspaper - adding he was "shocked" and "horrified" to be contacted in this way. Mr Chan said the texts "stereotype immigrants as a criminal community and create an atmosphere of fear". But the Home Office defended its position: "We are taking proactive steps to contact individuals who records show have no valid right to be in the UK." The individuals affected had been contacted in a variety of ways, including email and text, it added. It also denied that Mr Grover had been contacted at all. Mr Grover told the BBC he would instruct his lawyers to write to the Home Office, challenging its claim he had not received the text directly. The department has received more than 140 complaints about the campaign, although Capita said: "Most complaints occurred in the early part of the contract where Capita was, as part of the contract, updating sometimes out-of-date Home Office records." Capita believes that 4,160 people have departed the UK since December 2012 as a result as a result of being contacted, the Home Office said. Labour's shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: "Theresa May's immigration system lurches from one gimmick to another with little effect. "The reports that the government has allowed a private contractor to send British citizens text message telling them to leave the country demonstrates once more just how shambolic and incompetent the Home Office's border police is under Theresa May. "These messages will rightly cause distress and offence to British citizens, many of whom have done much to contribute to our society. It is simply wrong for this sort of message to be sent by text, and to be so poorly targeted." UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who campaigns for tighter border controls and Britain's exit from the EU, said the text message scheme was the product of a government with "absolutely zero sensibility and even less sense". "To send threatening text messages and emails to people on some sort of clearly ill-managed central database is deeply disturbing and the sort of behaviour one would expect from a fascistic police state, not a democratic and inclusive nation. Quite frankly it's abhorrent." UKIP MEP candidate Amjad Bashir said: "I find it utterly repugnant that people like me, who may have been born abroad but who are passport-holding and hard-working citizens of the UK are being threatened by the government in this way." Meanwhile, immigration minister Mark Harper has said that vans telling illegal immigrants in London to "go home or face arrest" could be deployed across the UK. He told BBC One's Question Time that the government was assessing the results of the scheme, which was piloted in the capital earlier this year. During July, they were driven around the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow for a week. Labour accused ministers of "borrowing the language" used by the National Front in the 1970s. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said the campaign had been "stupid and offensive". Earlier this month, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned the posters, saying they had misled the public about the arrest statistics displayed. However, it cleared the campaign of being offensive and irresponsible. Mr Harper told Question Time: "I don't have any problem with saying to people who are here illegally that they shouldn't be here anymore." </body>

      <title>McCartney plays surprise London gig</title>
      <description>Sir Paul McCartney delivers an impromptu gig in Covent Garden during the lunchtime rush.</description>

      <body>Sir Paul McCartney has given an impromptu gig in Covent Garden during the lunchtime rush. "Good afternoon," he told that assembled crowd of more than 2,000 fans. "Welcome to Covent Garden." "We're just going to do some songs from our new album so get your phones out... As if they weren't already," he added. The 71-year-old sang four songs from his latest album, New, from a truck parked on the piazza. It follows a similar stunt in New York last week. The London gig began at 1330 BST, about an hour after Sir Paul announced it on Twitter. "I'm getting ready to pop up in Covent Garden," the former Beatle tweeted. "Oh baby!" "Alright! Busking!" he joked after taking to the stage, watched by his daughter, Stella. "This is a change from the '60s because we would just have been coming in from the clubs right now." The singer opened with his current single, also called New, and closed with the same song approximately 20 minutes later, telling the audience: "Thank you very much. OK now, back to work!" "It was very exciting," Sir Paul told the BBC afterwards. "It felt little bit like I was in a dream - sort of a little bit spacey." The gig was an unexpected bonus for many tourists. "We were actually just looking around Covent Garden and we had this big surprise," said Flavia, a visitor from Paraguay. "I'm so happy, I can't believe!" She wasn't concerned by the abbreviated set, saying: "Even five minutes would be OK. Any time seeing him would be OK". Covent Garden employee Harel, 37, said he was "disappointed, but not surprised," Sir Paul only played five songs. While Craig Williams, who "legged it" to the show from work said, "even for that quick 10, 15 minutes, it's all worth it". "I honestly believe the Beatles' music saved my life," he added. "There were some dark times and he's just got a 'live life to the full' mentality, and I really clicked with that." The gig came exactly a week after Sir Paul was mobbed by fans, following a pop-up show in Times Square. He said the shows had been suggested by Stella. "She said, 'what you should do is just pop up somewhere and do a gig, and everyone will just get their phones out and they'll tweet it," the star told the BBC. "And I said, 'well that's not a bad idea - however, I've now got to go and do it!'" The hit-and-run concerts echo The Beatles' final live performance, a mile down the road from Covent Garden, on the roof of their record label, Apple. That show, in January 1969, brought traffic on Savile Row to a standstill and was eventually shut down by police who ordered the band's touring manager, Mal Evans, to turn off their amplifiers. "It started to filter up from Mal that the police were complaining," Sir Paul later recalled in The Beatles Anthology. "We said, 'We're not stopping'. He said, 'The police are going to arrest you'." The star remembered replying: "Good end to the film. Let them do it. Great! That's an end: Beatles Busted on Rooftop Gig!" McCartney's latest solo album was released on Monday. Early sales data suggests the record, which was produced by Mark Ronson (Amy Winehouse) and Paul Epworth (Adele), amongst others, is likely to chart at number three this weekend. He is also due to appear on BBC One's Graham Norton show on Friday night. </body>

      <title>Hodgson joke a compliment - Townsend</title>
      <description>England winger Andros Townsend describes the joke Roy Hodgson told that prompted a race row as a "compliment".</description>

      <body>Andros Townsend has described Roy Hodgson's comment that prompted a race row as a "compliment". England boss Hodgson was criticised for referring to a joke about a monkey and an astronaut at half-time in Tuesday's World Cup qualifier against Poland. Hodgson was trying to encourage right-back Chris Smalling to pass to Townsend, 22, more often. "The manager just told the players to give the ball to me so that's a compliment," said the Tottenham winger. "Everyone should be focusing on England qualifying for Brazil - not on negative silly news." The joke, the exact wording of which is still unclear, revolves around an astronaut and a monkey on a space mission. The monkey performs all the tasks requested by mission control, with the punchline being that the astronaut's only role is to feed the monkey. It came during Townsend's second game for England, after he had scored on his debut in the 4-1 win over Montenegro. "It's a dream come true to play for your country," said Townsend, who was speaking to BBC Sport news correspondent Natalie Pirks at a Spurs event to highlight breast cancer awareness.  "I had the perfect debut really, scoring a goal and getting man of the match, but I couldn't let it get to me or get big-headed as we had to concentrate on the next game. "It's only now after the games are done that I've realised how big it was for the country." Hodgson said on Friday that he and the players were angry that the race row had overshadowed England's achievement in qualifying for the World Cup in Brazil next year. "Joy is short-lived in this job," he told the Daily Mail.  "The players are as angry about this as I am. "We have just had a successful period and, although I wouldn't suggest we intend to rest on our laurels, I think we have earned the right to enjoy the fruits of our labours. Instead we get this." Former Southampton and England forward Matthew Le Tissier says he is disturbed that there is somebody in the dressing room that Hodgson cannot trust. "That's not a great thing to have," Le Tissier told BBC Sport. "If the player is offended then pull Roy to one side and be a man about it. Roy is the type of guy who will have gone 'I didn't really mean any offence and I apologise'. "That would have been the end of the matter." Anti-racism campaigners Kick It Out had called for the Football Association to investigate the comments, but it considered the matter closed on Thursday after the governing body released a statement in support of Hodgson. "Roy Hodgson is a man of the highest integrity, an honourable man who is doing a great job with the England team," said FA chairman Greg Dyke. "He has fully explained to us what he said and the point he was making to the players in the dressing room at half-time on Tuesday night. He has also explained the context in which he made his remarks." However, another campaign group has sent a formal complaint to the FA in which it calls for an independent investigation into the issue. In the four-page complaint, Race for Sport, an off-shoot of the Society for Black Lawyers, says the decision to consider the matter closed is "unacceptable". It also demands "cultural intelligence" training for Hodgson and all football managers. England striker Wayne Rooney showed his support for 66-year-old Hodgson on Twitter   and via his personal website.  "To try and pin some form of label on him is absolutely ridiculous," he said. "Roy spoke to Andros straight away and he took no offence whatsoever. Hopefully that's now the end of the matter." </body>

      <body>Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho believes John Terry may have been too hasty by announcing his England retirement. The 32-year-old defender won 78 caps but quit in September 2012 after a racism row involving Anton Ferdinand. Mourinho believes his captain could still do a job for his country after "recovering his self-esteem". "If I was a football player I would wait for the national team to say we don't need you any more," said Mourinho. "That is just my personal feeling. For sure he has reasons that push him for that decision." Terry was cleared at Westminster Magistrates' Court of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand during a Premier League game in October 2011, but said his position in the national team became "untenable" when the Football Association pursued charges against him. Terry's final appearance for the Three Lions was the 5-0 World Cup qualifying win away to Moldova 13 months ago. He made just 11 Premier League starts last season but has been involved in all seven top-flight games since Mourinho returned to Stamford Bridge in the summer. "He is recovering his self-esteem, recovering the feeling of being an important player for the team which he lost," Mourinho added. "The reasons that pushed him to international retirement are out of my control." England manager Roy Hodgson was asked this week whether Terry or Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand could force their way back into his World Cup plans. "I like John Terry, he did a fantastic job for me at the Euros," Hodgson told BBC Radio 5 live. "But it's not the moment to start resurrecting that." </body>

      <body>Andy Murray says he will compete in the Australian Open only if he is "100% fit" following back surgery. The Wimbledon champion began his rehabilitation last week after a disc operation last month. Murray, 26, will miss the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London but wants to be ready for the first Grand Slam of 2014 in Melbourne in January. "I hope so, but I'm not going to come back unless I'm 100% fit. I've got a long way to go yet," said the Scot. "I've been in the swimming pool and on the bike a little bit but it's still going to be four or five weeks until I'm back on the tennis court hitting some balls. "The rehab process is pretty tedious and long and I don't want to come back too soon and have to start that process all over again. I'll only come back when I'm 100% fit and I hope that's at the beginning of the year." Murray, who received an OBE from Prince William at Buckingham Palace on Thursday, pulled out of the French Open in May because of his back problems. The world number four recovered in time to become Britain's first male Wimbledon singles' champion since 1936. His defence of the US Open ended in the quarter-finals, but he helped Great Britain beat Croatia in the Davis Cup before surgery. </body>

      <body>Championship leader Marc Marquez crashed in practice for Sunday's Australian Grand Prix as title rival Jorge Lorenzo finished fastest. The 20-year-old Spaniard, who is closing in on the world title in his rookie season, came off his bike early in the afternoon session. He was uninjured and was able to return to the circuit 20 minutes later. Marquez finished the day second fastest, 0.294 seconds behind Lorenzo, who clocked one minute 28.961secs. British rider Cal Crutchlow was sixth fastest, while his Tech 3 Yamaha team-mate Bradley Smith recorded the seventh quickest time. Marquez is bidding to become the first rookie in 35 years to win the premier class title. He leads the standings by 43 points and can win the championship on Sunday if he wins the race and closest challenger Lorenzo finishes third or lower. "The day went well, especially in the morning," said Repsol Honda rider Marquez. "It's a pity about the crash right at the start of the afternoon run but we went back out with the second bike, which had a totally different geometry, and we had no time in which to change things. Thus, we used the initial set-up for the entire session." Spain's Alvaro Bautista had the third-fastest lap, 0.477secs down on Lorenzo, with Marquez's Spanish team-mate Dani Pedrosa fourth at 0.517secs. Seven-time MotoGP world champion Valentino Rossi was fifth quickest. Pedrosa's afternoon practice session was disrupted when an engine mounting bolt, which was not properly locked, came loose, forcing him to stop on the track. "Today was very positive, the new asphalt felt good and the tyres worked well for us," said Pedrosa. "The only setback was that we were unable to make the most of all the time available, due to a problem with the bike at the end of the afternoon session." LCR Honda's Stefan Bradl, who fractured an ankle at Sepang last Saturday, was able to take part in opening practice but finished almost four seconds off the pace and was later declared unfit. Results 1. Jorge Lorenzo (Spa) Yamaha 1:28.961 2. Marc Marquez (Spa) Repsol Honda 0.088 3. Alvaro Bautista (Spa) Honda Gresini 0.664 4. Dani Pedrosa (Spa) Repsol Honda 0.841 5.

      <body>Former world champion Nigel Mansell says proposed weight limits in Formula 1 are "disgraceful" and "discrimination against the medium-sized large driver". Next year's minimum weight limit has been increased to take into account the introduction of new engines. But the engines are turning out to be heavier than expected, meaning taller - therefore heavier - drivers will be at a disadvantage. "It's wrong. They [the drivers] are not jockeys," says Mansell. The weight limit for the driver and the car this season is set at 642kg but with new, heavier 1.6-litre V6 turbo engines and energy recovery systems being introduced in 2014, the minimum weight has been raised to 690kg. However, much of the extra 48kg is expected to be taken up by the new power units, leaving less leeway for the weight of the drivers. Every kilogram a driver adds will matter, with 1kg of weight equating to about 0.035secs a lap on an average circuit. Consequently, a driver like Fernando Alonso, who weighs 68kg, will have an advantage over Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg, who weighs 74kg. Mansell added: "It's disgraceful, it's discrimination against the medium-sized large driver. "In years gone by, we didn't have traction control or power steering - you had to be a strong driver and there were a lot of strong drivers. If you had this weight limit, they wouldn't have been able to drive cars many years ago - or they would have driven with great difficulty. "So I think get the weight limit up a bit, make some cars carry some ballast so that the bigger drivers don't suffer as much. " McLaren's Jenson Button, who weighs 74kg, has already expressed concern, saying ahead of the Korean Grand Prix: "I'm 74-75kg with my kit and I struggle to meet the weight limit. I have done for three years. "I love fitness training but there are things I can't do because I have to be a set weight - not eat carbohydrates, not build muscle. And next year it will be worse. I don't think any team will have ballast next year." </body>

      <body>Google shares have topped $1,000 (£617) for the first time after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. The company posted a 36% jump in net profits to $2.97bn for the July-to-September period. Shares in the giant online search and ads company rose more than 13% to $1,006, and are now up 41% since the start of 2013. Google's revenues also beat forecasts with a 12% rise year-on-year. "We are closing in on our goal of a beautiful, simple, and intuitive experience regardless of your device," Google's chief Larry Page said in a conference call with analysts. The strong earnings report also helped other online companies, with Facebook shares adding 4.4% to a new high of more than $55. Amazon rose 3.4%. At $1,000 a share, Google's market value is about $334bn, which is still well below Apple's $461bn. Google was floated in August 2004 at $85 a share, giving the company a market value at the time of $23bn. The company reported its quarterly earnings on Thursday after US markets had closed. Google said that paid-for clicks increased by a quarter during the July-to-September period, from a year earlier, the highest rate of growth in the past year. This offset an 8% fall in average cost-per-click, the price advertisers pay Google when consumers click on their ads. "We view solid paid clicks growth to be a good indicator of demand, driven by the continued shift to mobile," JP Morgan analysts said in a note. Several brokers have raised their share price target for Google on the back of the company's new initiatives to attract advertisers. In February, the company launched a service to help advertisers market through a mix of smartphones, tablets and desktop computers. And analysts believe there is still significant potential to generate revenues from its video-streaming website YouTube. YouTube-branded video-ads surged more than 75% in the quarter from a year earlier, with 40% of traffic now coming from mobile devices. "We estimate that Google's key YouTube asset generated approximately $4bn in revenue in 2012, positioning Google extremely well for the strong growth in video advertising," RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. Analysts at Jefferies said Google is best positioned to benefit from mobile devices with one billion activations of its Android system. Google sells applications and content through its Google Play store. </body>

      <title>Portillo 'misspeaks' on pleb claims</title>
      <description>Michael Portillo says he "misspoke" when he claimed he had sometimes heard former Conservative chief whip Andrew Mitchell use the word "pleb" in private.</description>

      <body>Michael Portillo has said he "misspoke" when he claimed he had heard former Conservative chief whip Andrew Mitchell say the word "pleb". Mr Mitchell resigned his post in 2012 after Downing Street police accused him of calling them plebs during a row - a word he denied having used. In a live discussion on the BBC's This Week, Mr Portillo revealed: "I have heard him use that word in private conversation - the pleb word, I mean." But he now says he got "carried away". Pressed on the This Week programme on Thursday about whether he had heard Mr Mitchell use the word, Mr Portillo said: "I think I did, but not in a bad context. "Some policeman thought: 'Ah, that's a word that people will believe that Andrew Mitchell might have used.' "But he wouldn't have used it in that context." On Friday, the former Conservative cabinet minister added: "I seem to have misspoken. I had no right to say that. "I think I got carried away in the heat of the moment. I did not mean to say it and I want to withdraw it." The former politician, who served as defence secretary under John Major, is a regular pundit on the show. Mr Mitchell admitted swearing during the September 2012 row with police officers who said he could not ride his bicycle through the main Downing Street gate. But he also maintained: "I think most people who know me know I would not use words like pleb or moron in describing anyone." The Conservative MP has claimed that the officers involved conspired against him in a bid to "toxify" his party. After a meeting with Mr Mitchell at his Sutton Coldfield constituency office in October 2012, three local representatives of the Police Federation criticised the MP for casting doubt on the Downing Street officers' version of events, said he had refused to disclose the exact words he had used in the row, and had "no option but to resign". Mr Mitchell says he has a transcript contradicting their account of the meeting. The chiefs of West Mercia, West Midlands and Warwickshire police forces concluded that no disciplinary action was needed against their officers, even though an internal investigation by West Mercia Police had initially said there was a "case to answer for misconduct". The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has said the officers who spoke to Mr Mitchell should have faced misconduct hearings, and Prime Minister David Cameron has said the MP is "owed an apology". Eight people have been arrested and bailed under Scotland Yard's investigation into the affair, including five police officers. The Crown Prosecution Service is considering whether to bring criminal charges against any of them. </body>

      <title>Sleep 'cleans' the brain of toxins</title>
      <description>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins of a hard day's thinking, US researchers have demonstrated.</description>

      <body>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking, researchers have shown. The US team believe the "waste removal system" is one of the fundamental reasons for sleep. Their study, in the journal Science, showed brain cells shrink during sleep to open up the gaps between neurons and allow fluid to wash the brain clean. They also suggest that failing to clear away some toxic proteins may play a role in brain disorders. One big question for sleep researchers is why do animals sleep at all when it leaves them vulnerable to predators? It has been shown to have a big role in the fixing of memories in the brain and learning, but a team at the University of Rochester Medical Centre believe that "housework" may be one of the primary reasons for sleep. "The brain only has limited energy at its disposal and it appears that it must choose between two different functional states - awake and aware or asleep and cleaning up," said researcher Dr Maiken Nedergaard. "You can think of it like having a house party. You can either entertain the guests or clean up the house, but you can't really do both at the same time." Their findings build on last year's discovery of the brain's own network of plumbing pipes - known as the glymphatic system - which carry waste material out of the brain. Scientists, who imaged the brains of mice, showed that the glymphatic system became 10-times more active when the mice were asleep. Cells in the brain, probably the glial cells which keep nerve cells alive, shrink during sleep. This increases the size of the interstitial space, the gaps between brain tissue, allowing more fluid to be pumped in and wash the toxins away. Dr Nedergaard said this was a "vital" function for staying alive, but did not appear to be possible while the mind was awake. She told the BBC: "This is purely speculation, but it looks like the brain is losing a lot of energy when pumping water across the brain and that is probably incompatible with processing information." She added that the true significance of the findings would be known only after human studies, but doing similar experiments in an MRI machine would be relatively easy. Commenting on the research Dr Neil Stanley, an independent sleep expert, said: "This is a very interesting study that shows sleep is essential downtime to do some housekeeping to flush out neurotoxins. "There is good data on memory and learning, the psychological reason for sleep. But this is the actual physical and chemical reason for sleep, something is happening which is important." Dr Raphaelle Winsky-Sommerer, a lecturer in sleep at Surrey University, said: "It's not surprising, our whole physiology is changing during sleep. "The novelty is the role of the interstitial space, but I think it's an added piece of the puzzle not the whole mechanism. "The significance is that, yet again, it shows sleep may contribute to the restoration of brain cell function and may have protective effects." Many conditions which lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease are characterised by the build-up of damaged proteins in the brain. The researchers suggest that problems with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to such diseases, but caution more research is needed. The charity Alzheimer's Research UK said more research would be needed to see whether damage to the brain's waste clearance system could lead to diseases like dementia, but the findings offered a "potential new avenue for investigation". </body>

      <title>National teacher strike may go ahead</title>
      <description>Teaching unions say they will press ahead with plans for a one-day national strike before Christmas if the dispute is not resolved.</description>

      <body>Teaching unions say they will press ahead with a one-day national strike before Christmas if a dispute over pay, pensions and jobs is not resolved. Nearly 3,500 schools were closed or partially closed on Thursday in London, Cumbria, and the South East, North East and South West of England. This was the third in a rolling campaign of regional walk-outs. A national strike would include Wales, as teachers' pay and conditions are determined by Westminster. Teachers are angry about the introduction of performance related pay and changes which mean they will have to work until they are at least 65 to be eligible for a full pension, rising to 68 for those born after 1978, say the unions. They also complain of excessive workloads, changes to their working conditions and job cuts. Teachers in the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber region walked out on 1 October. This followed a strike across the North West on 27 June. So far Wales has not been affected by the strikes. Teachers in Northern Ireland and Scotland deal with their devolved governments on pay and conditions and so will remain unaffected by this dispute. The NASUWT says it is considering its next steps but it is likely that the planned one-day national strike will go ahead if the government does not address its concerns. The union's general secretary Chris Keates said: "The rolling programme of strike action has commanded support from the overwhelming majority of teachers. "The Secretary of State can no longer claim that the majority of teachers support his reforms. Teachers' anger and frustration is much in evidence and he now needs to begin to seriously address their concerns. "The NASUWT National Action Committee is keeping matters under review." The government restated its disappointment that the unions were striking over measures to allow head teachers to pay good teachers more. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said only around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed on Thursday, compared with 60% who walked out in the national strikes of November 2011. The government says that it has met the unions frequently to discuss their concerns and will continue to do so. </body>

      <title>Major piracy site to be shut down</title>
      <description>IsoHunt, a major website that indexed illegal files, is to close and pay $110m (£68m) to a US movie industry body.</description>

      <body>IsoHunt, a popular website offering BitTorrents of mostly pirated material, is to shut down following a court settlement. The site's owner, Canadian Gary Fung, has agreed to pay $110m (£68m) to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). MPAA chairman Chris Dodd said the move was a "major step forward" for legitimate commerce online. In a blog post, Mr Fung said: "It's sad to see my baby go." The site is currently still online, but will soon be shut. It is one of the most popular sites of its kind on the internet. A group of companies, including Disney, Paramount and Twentieth Century Fox, accused the site of wilfully infringing copyright by listing millions of popular movies and TV programmes - in a court battle that has lasted for more than seven years. Now Mr Fung has agreed to settle. He added: "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race and I have remained faithful. 10.5 years of IsoHunt has been a long journey by any business definition and forever in internet start-up time. "It started as a programming hobby in my university days that has become so, so much more." Court documents acknowledged that it is unlikely that Mr Fung's company could pay $110m, and that the MPAA would probably receive between $2m and $4m. Like a similar site, The Pirate Bay, that has been blocked in the UK by a court order, IsoHunt did not host pirated material itself. It instead acted as a directory of sources from which to download illegal files. According to court documents, Mr Fung's defence hinged on this degree of separation - and argued that it was the users of IsoHunt responsible for distributing pirated material, not IsoHunt. The Californian court disagreed. "It sends a strong message that those who build businesses around encouraging, enabling, and helping others to commit copyright infringement are themselves infringers, and will be held accountable for their illegal actions," said MPAA chairman Mr Dodd. "The successful outcome of this landmark lawsuit will also will help preserve jobs and protect the tens of thousands of businesses in the creative industries, whose hard work and investments are exploited by sites like IsoHunt." Ahead of the ruling, Mr Fung had taken to social news site Reddit to take part in an AMAA - Ask Me Almost Anything - session. In it, he described himself as a "reluctant revolutionary", and backed calls for copyright reform. He said he did not hold a disregard for the law, and acted upon requests to remove links to pirated content when the company was made aware. He also said the industry could render sites like IsoHunt obsolete if it offered simultaneous releases worldwide, as well as digital offerings that were cheaper than physical copies. His thoughts echoed findings by a trio of researchers at George Mason University in Virginia, US. Their site piracydata.org has been collating the weekly top 10 most-pirated films and investigating whether legal digital methods were available. They found that half of the movies in the list were not available to access legally online. Furthermore, none of the 10 titles could be streamed - arguably the most straightforward way to consume media online. However, in contrast, efforts by Fox to curb piracy of TV series The Walking Dead fell flat. Despite the first episode of the latest series being made available to stream free online, the programme was still illegally downloaded more than 500,000 times, according to data gathered by Torrentfreak.com.

      <title>Blow to multiple human species idea</title>
      <description>The earliest humans from two million years ago in Eurasia and Africa were all part of the same species, refuting suggestions that several distinct types were around at the same time, a study finds.</description>

      <body>The idea that there were several different human species walking the Earth two million years ago has been dealt a blow. Instead, scientists say early human fossils found in Africa and Eurasia may have been part of the same species. Writing in the journal Science, the team says that Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus are all part of a single evolving lineage that led to modern humans. But others in the field reject this. A team looked at the most complete hominid skull ever found, which was uncovered in Dmanisi, Georgia. It had a small braincase, large teeth and a long face, characteristics it shares with H. habilis. But many features from the braincase were also "unique" to H. erectus. The 1.8-million-year old skull comes from a site that has given up the biggest collection of well-preserved early-human remains known anywhere in the world. The Dmanisi collection also represents the earliest evidence of primitive humans outside Africa, a group that emerged soon after early Homo diverged from Australopithecus, or "Lucy". "We now have the best evidence for what early Homo really is," said lead author David Lordkipanidze from the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi, Georgia. "One of the most important things is that we have such a remarkable collection; it's very rare that you have that from one site." The fossil remains showed a lot of variation that had previously puzzled researchers, but Prof Lordkipanidze said it was clear that these features were all from one population. "When we looked at this variability and compared it with modern humans, you can see this is a normal range of variation," Prof Lordkipanidze told BBC News. The skull was uncovered eight years ago and since then the team has compared it to other Homo fossils found in Africa from as early as 2.4 million years ago. The comparative analysis of the hominid cranium revealed enough similarities for the team to consider the earliest Homo fossils as the same species as the Dmanisi hominids. A co-author of the study, Christoph Zollikofer from the Anthropological Institute and Museum in Zurich, Switzerland, said that if the braincase and the face of "Skull 5" had been found as separate fossils at different sites in Africa, they might have been attributed to different species. "That's because Skull 5 unites some key features, like the tiny braincase and large face, which had not been observed together in an early Homo fossil until now. "Furthermore, since we see a similar pattern and range of variation in the African fossil record, it is sensible to assume that there was a single Homo species at that time in Africa," Prof Zollikofer added. "And since the Dmanisi hominids are so similar to the African ones, we further assume that they both represent the same species." Other palaeoanthropologists, however, believe that at least three distinct species of humans co-existed in Africa. They include Fred Spoor from University College London. He told BBC News that the methods of analysis that the team used were not sufficient to infer that these fossils were the same species. "They do a very general shape analysis of the cranium which describes the shape of the face and braincase in broad sweeping terms," Prof Spoor Said. "The problem is that those Homo species are not defined using such a broad overview of what their general cranial shape is." He added that the very specific characteristics that had been used to define H. erectus, H. habilis and H. rudolfensis "were not captured by the landmarks that they used". "They did not consider that the thick and protruding brow ridges, the angular back of the braincase; and some details of the base of the cranium are derived features for H. erectus, and not present in H. habilis and H. rudolfensis." Chris Stringer at the Natural History Museum in London said that the team had made an excellent case "that this remarkable new skull, with its huge jawbone", was part of the natural variation of the Dmanisi population. But he said he was doubtful that all of the early Homo fossils could be "lumped into an evolving H. erectus lineage". "Only H. erectus survives and becomes successful but at the origin, nature was experimenting with how to evolve humans in terms of increasing brain size," Prof Stringer told BBC News. "Creatures were starting to use tools and eat meat, and this drove evolution, but I think it also drove diversity. The Dmanisi group is an example of the successful species that came out of that and then carried on to spread around the old world." </body>

Tennant and the cast won enthusiastic applause on Thursday's opening night in Stratford-upon-Avon. The production transfers to the Barbican in London in December. It reunites Tennant with Hamlet director Gregory Doran, who is now in charge at the RSC. Starting with Richard II, Doran intends to stage each one of Shakespeare's plays once over the next six years up to 2019. Written almost entirely in verse, Richard II is a story of power and plotting in which the king's weakness and vanity threatens to drag his people into a civil war. In the cast alongside Tennant are Michael Pennington as John of Gaunt, Nigel Lindsay as Henry Bolingbroke, Oliver Ford Davies as the Duke of York and Jane Lapotaire as the Duchess of Gloucester. The play opens with a funeral lament sung live by a small choir, after which Tennant's smooth-chinned, long-haired Richard arrives in a flowing white robe, in sharp contrast to those around him in chain-mail or mourning black. In another scene he preens his rock-star locks in a mirror. "His hair takes some getting used to," notes The Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish. "Great gingery-brown extensions trail girlishly downwards. Long, magisterial, quasi-medieval robes add to the effeminate impression. "With his startled eyes and concentrated frown, Tennant is frail, pale and consistently interesting but the nervous energy he excels in is confined to quarters early on." Tennant gives a "mesmerising performance that grows in power as Richard's authority declines," according to Michael Billington in The Guardian. "The packed houses for this production's run in both Stratford and at the Barbican may have much to do with Tennant's star presence. But this is the strongest company the RSC has fielded in years." The Independent's Paul Taylor called it "another palpable hit for the Tennant/Doran collaboration". Recent star-name portrayals of Richard II include Eddie Redmayne at the Donmar Warehouse in 2011 and Ben Whishaw's Bafta-winning TV performance in the BBC's The Hollow Crown last year. Tennant told The Independent recently Richard II was a play he had loved since drama school when he saw a production with Sir Derek Jacobi. "It's quite unknowable," he said. "There are no heroes and villains in it, just people trying their best and not managing to get on with their lives." Tennant's association with the RSC goes back to 1996 when, aged 25, he played Touchstone in As You Like It. His other RSC appearances include Romeo and Juliet, The Comedy of Errors, Love's Labour's Lost and The Rivals. By the time he played the Prince of Denmark in Doran's modern-dress Hamlet in 2008, Tennant was a household name because of his lead role in Doctor Who. Tennant's last Shakespearean stage role was Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing in the West End in 2011, alongside his former Tardis companion Catherine Tate as Beatrice. He will be appearing alongside Matt Smith in the Doctor Who 50th anniversary story, The Day of the Doctor, on BBC One on 23 November. Richard II is at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until to 16 November and at the Barbican Theatre, London, from 9 December to 25 January. It will be broadcast live on 13 November to cinemas across the UK. </body>

      <title>The problem with taking too many vitamins</title>
      <description>Millions of people swear by vitamin supplements. But many are wasting their time and some could even be harming themselves, argues Dr Chris van Tulleken.</description>

      <body>Millions of people swear by vitamin supplements. But many are wasting their time and some could even be harming themselves, argues Dr Chris van Tulleken. In November 1912 a party of three men and 16 dogs set out from a remote base in eastern Antarctica to explore a series of crevasses many hundreds of miles away. Three months later just one of the men returned. His name was Douglas Mawson. His skin was peeling off and his hair was falling out. He had lost almost half his body weight. He recounted what Sir Edmund Hillary described as "the greatest story of lone survival in the history of polar exploration". A month into their journey, one of the team, along with the tent, most of the provisions and six dogs plunged into a crevasse, never to be seen again. Mawson and the other surviving member, Xavier Mertz, started to return to base, surviving in part by eating the remaining dogs. After a few weeks Mertz developed stomach pains and diarrhoea. Then his skin started to peel off and his hair fell out. He died incontinent and delirious a few days later. Mawson suffered similar symptoms. With the kind of understatement typical of his generation of polar explorers he described the skin of the soles of his feet peeling off: "The sight of my feet gave me quite a shock, for the thickened skin of the soles had separated in each case as a complete layer... The new skin underneath was very much abraded and raw." It was the suffering of early explorers and sailors that motivated the first studies of vitamins and their deficiency diseases. At first sight Mawson's story seems to be another such tale - starvation combined with a lack of some vital nutrient. In fact, Mawson's description of his symptoms is an almost textbook description of vitamin A overdose - probably from eating dog liver. As little as 100g of husky liver could give a hungry explorer a fatal dose. Mawson lived to the decent age of 76 but in his story we find the cautionary tale for our times - vitamins can be very bad for you. This piece is about what we have learned about vitamin supplements in the last few years - if you are healthy, and you live in a country like the UK, taking multi-vitamins and high-dose antioxidants may shorten your life. For most of us, for most of the time, they're unhealthy. "Argh!" I hear you say, "I spend loads of money on them and the claims on the packet are really persuasive. Everything, from my full head of hair to my sex life, depends on them!" I want to get into this in a bit more detail because the vitamin companies certainly don't agree with me. So why do we believe they're useful and why do we take them? Vitamins are essential for life, and there are groups of people even in the UK who benefit from specific supplementation, but general unsupervised vitamin pill-popping is more than just a waste of money. The problem is that we all feel very warm and fuzzy about vitamins because, firstly, the tales of deficiency are so horrific, secondly, we read breakfast cereal packs and thirdly, a double-Nobel laureate called Linus Pauling liked vitamin C in vast, vast doses. All this is packaged by the people now selling us vitamins over the counter into that most beguiling of all logical falsehoods - if a little is good, then more must be better. Now I knew the names of the most obscure vitamins long before medical school because I have always had a fondness for the kind of multicoloured, artificially flavoured breakfast cereals that are marketed using a combination of unlikely cartoon animals and claims of being "vitamin and mineral-enriched". And it has to be said that this vitamin and mineral enrichment of staple food has been one of the most effective public health interventions in history. It continues to save countless lives per year even in Europe. So, while you shouldn't eat dog liver in Antarctica, vitamin A deficiency hugely increases the risk of blindness and death in children with measles and diarrhoea in developing countries. So the World Health Organization recommends a very strict amount and cautions that higher doses can cause birth defects in early pregnancy among other problems. So vitamins do make a huge difference to life expectancy in some circumstances, which is persuasive, and the breakfast propaganda catches us in our most vulnerable, bleary-eyed, early morning state, hinting to us that these vitamins have some sort of catch-all, beneficial effect on our lives, that will transform us into the healthy, energetic beautiful people/cartoon creatures portrayed on the cereal box. These things contribute to a general ideal of healthfulness of vitamins. And then there's Linus Pauling. Whether or not you've heard of him, Linus Pauling is a major influence on vitamin and nutrient culture. It's almost impossible to imagine someone with more authority and credibility. He won two Nobel prizes and was, by all accounts, a genuinely good bloke. He wrote a book in 1970 saying that high doses of vitamin C could be effective in combating flu, cancer, cardiovascular disease, infections and degenerative problems. He took immense quantities himself, hundreds of times the required amount, and lived to a ripe old age surrounded by many great grandchildren. He was the poster boy for mega-dosing of vitamins and this contributed to the growth of an industry supported by the belief that supplementation of these molecules in our diet is beneficial in almost every way imaginable. But rather than taking one man's word for it, however credible, it's worth looking at the results of studies that look at what happens to people who take these supplements for long periods of time. Looking at any one individual study won't be very revealing to answer the question of whether vitamin supplementation is good for you. They're densely scientific and the conflicts of interest can be very hard to spot. For the answer you have to turn to what are called "systematic review papers". This is where independent scientists gather up all the available data and re-analyse it to answer big questions. Here's what a couple of them say: "We found no evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention [of diseases of any kind]. Beta-carotene and vitamin E seem to increase mortality, and so may higher doses of vitamin A. Antioxidant supplements need to be considered as medicinal products and should undergo sufficient evaluation before marketing". (See references below). Just to be clear - "increase mortality" - that means they're killing you. These are powerfully bioactive compounds but they're not regulated in the same way as drugs. Whatever you think about the regulation there should surely be a warning on the pack if there's data saying they're bad for us. The next question is - why are they bad for us? It's very hard to pick apart the data, partly because vitamins are a fabulously diverse group of chemicals. I'm going to include what people normally refer to as minerals under the heading of vitamins. They're required in the diet not for energy, but as chemical partners for the enzymes involved in the body's metabolism - cell production, tissue repair, and other vital processes. Their functions are understood largely by their deficiency diseases so we're not exactly sure of precisely what they all do or how they interact. Antioxidants provide a nice example. They soak up the very toxic, chemically-reactive by-products of metabolism called free radicals. These free radicals, left unchecked, can cause damage to DNA and may be linked to cancer. Your cells are full of antioxidants but surely taking more would be better? Right? Keep those cancer causing radicals under control? Well, unfortunately, your body's immune system fights infections by using free radicals to kill bugs. Exactly what effect huge quantities of extra antioxidants could have on this is not clear but it's easy to imagine that it might not be good and you could get more infections. Vitamin A is linked to increasing lung cancer in smokers. Excess zinc is linked to reduced immune function. Long-term excessive intake of manganese is linked to muscle and nerve disorders in older people. Niacin in excess has been linked to cell damage. And so on. And it gets more complicated still when you start mixing everything up in one tablet. For example, different minerals compete for absorption. If you take large quantities of calcium you won't be able to absorb your iron. If you take large quantities of iron you won't be able to absorb zinc. If you take vitamin C you'll reduce your copper level. So it's not just that taking lots of one thing is not good for you, it's that it may cause a dangerous reduction in something else even if you are also supplementing that. To work out the optimal ratios is all but impossible although some manufactures claim to have worked it out. So when are supplements recommended? The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends certain supplements for some groups of people who are at risk of deficiency, including: Your GP may also recommend supplements if you need them for a medical condition. If you decide to take supplements, stick to within the RDA, unless you've had guidance from a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist to exceed the dose. If you've got questions about dosage levels, consult a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist. The tales of deficiency combined with the success of enrichment programmes mean that it's easy to make that leap of logic that if a little is good then more must be better. And if you read my article last week on water you'll see where this is going. I could do this every week. The same article. Substitute water for vitamins/probiotics/antibiotics. Don't trust the science done by the people who are trying to sell them to you and don't assume that if some is good more must be better. It's like beer. Or coffee. Or computer games. Goldilocks was right about things needing to be just right. References: Bjelakovic G, Nikolova D, Simonetti RG, Gluud C.

      <title>Owner of killer dogs avoids jail</title>
      <description>A sentencing hearing for a woman who caused suffering to four dogs that killed a teenager is told of the "horrific" attack scene found by police.</description>

      <body>The moment a policeman found a girl who had been mauled to death by four dogs was the most distressing sight of his life, a court has heard. Jade Anderson, 14, died on 26 March at the house in Atherton, near Wigan. Magistrates heard PC Martin Burkinshaw would "never forget" encountering a bull mastiff-type dog covered in blood. Speaking after the sentencing of dog owner Beverley Concannon, Jade's family said they were "disgusted" she had walked free with a suspended sentence. At Wigan Magistrates Court, 45-year-old Concannon was given a 16-week suspended jail term after admitting causing suffering to the four animals. Jade had been at Concannon's house in Chaucer Grove visiting a teenage friend. The judge said Concannon, who was out of the house when Jade was attacked, should have been aware of her dogs' aggression. In September, the Crown Prosecution Service ruled there was "insufficient evidence" to bring a charge of manslaughter by gross negligence against Concannon. It was also not possible to bring charges under the Dangerous Dogs Act because her animals were not banned breeds and were not out of control in a public place. Jade's mother and stepfather have campaigned for the government to tighten the laws around dangerous animal ownership. They want dog owners who fail to stop their pet attacking someone to be liable to prosecution. Speaking after Concannon's sentencing, Jade's stepfather Michael Anderson said: "I'm devastated and disgusted in the justice system. "Today was just about dangerous dogs. I think she should be held responsible for Jade. "We have got a life sentence. It has absolutely ripped us apart." During the sentencing hearing, Paul Taylor, prosecuting, read a statement from PC Burkinshaw about how the officer found Jade's body in the kitchen and all four dogs at the back door trying to get in. The statement said: "The sound of the dogs in the backyard was horrific. "I will never forget what I saw. There was a large white bull mastiff-type dog. "Its head and mouth were covered in fresh blood and it was bounding in the back yard." The hearing was told how one dog, Buddy, an American bulldog, was "stir crazy". It was kept in a cage as punishment and was not walked or trained, the court was told. The dogs were put down after the attack on Jade. District Judge Mark Hadfield told Concannon her treatment of the dogs had contributed to their state. He ordered her to pay costs and a victim surcharge totalling £165 and banned her from keeping dogs indefinitely. </body>

      <title>Loneliness affects 'half of adults'</title>
      <description>Almost half of all adults in England say they experience feelings of loneliness, according to the results of a BBC poll.</description>

      <body>Almost half of all adults in England say they experience feelings of loneliness, according to a BBC poll. Commissioned as part of the Faith In The World Week, the survey showed that 48% of adults feel varying degrees of loneliness. It also showed that people who practise a religion feel lonelier than those who do not. London is said to be the loneliest place with a figure of 52% compared to 45% in the South West of England. The survey, which was carried out by polling company ComRes on behalf of Radio 2 and BBC Local Radio, also showed: On Friday, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said society had "utterly failed" to confront the problem of loneliness. He quoted figures from the Campaign to End Loneliness that suggested 800,000 people were chronically lonely in England. Mervyn Kohler, a special adviser for Age UK, said he was not surprised by the results and believed that loneliness was a "serious problem". "We find fairly horrifying the number of elderly people who feel the TV is their best friend," he said. "Loneliness is on the increase for a variety of reasons, mostly because of the changing nature of society with families becoming split up as children move away." So-called befriending schemes have become one way in which those experiencing loneliness try to meet others. Liliane Mitchell said she suffered from loneliness when she moved to a new town, split up with her husband and was diagnosed with cancer all in a relatively short period of time. She said: "Post-treatment we had a very severe winter and I was very poorly and housebound for three days. "I thought, 'I don't believe this is happening to me, I'm on my own - totally on my own'." She then joined a befriending scheme. "They become friends, but it's different I think, because they want to be there and they want to help you," she said. Homelessness can also lead to people feeling lonely and detached from society. Matthew Fowler, 26, lives and works at the Emmaus Community, in Brighton, which helps homeless people. "The loneliest I've felt would have been in the daytime when people are going about their business on their lunch breaks and work - going on living their lives - and I'm basically strolling the streets. "That makes me feel really lonely and really detached from society." Mr Kohler, from Age UK, said schemes which aim to help tackle loneliness have come under financial pressure in the current economic climate. He said."Austerity undoubtedly has had an effect. "In the context of public sector cuts, community centres and other publicly-owned meeting places are struggling to exist." He said the problem needed to be tackled by "rekindling some of the local community glue that we can see operating in rural areas". "However, I think the elderly population also have to change their attitudes and approach to this," he said. "They have to make sure that they are joining in with local community activities and have a grip of modern technology to be able to communicate." </body>

      <body>Management and unions at the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical plant have failed to reach a deal which would see the site fired up again. Operators Ineos asked the Unite union to make a commitment to call no further industrial action this year. Unite said it would agree to this, but on the condition that Ineos would not impose its planned cuts on the workforce during the same period. The two sides held a face-to-face meeting at the plant earlier. Ineos said it would have restarted operations at the site on Friday if Unite had given the company a "no conditions, no strings attached" assurance of no further industrial action this year. However, it claimed the union had refused that offer. Calum MacLean, Ineos Grangemouth (UK) chairman, said: "Unite's response is unbelievable given how much effort has been put into securing this deal with ourselves, the Scottish and the UK governments all working hard to find a way forward. "We will now concentrate on discussing the Survival Plan with our staff during the 60-day consultation". Unite said it had already promised no strike action before Christmas but the union repeated its calls for Ineos to abandon proposed changes to staff contracts. Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scottish secretary, said: "At Acas talks earlier this week, Unite committed to conducting no industrial action ballots or industrial action before 31 December 2013. "This was on the basis that the company would not impose cuts on the workforce during the same period. Unite also proposed that these negotiations over the future of the site during this period would be held under the auspices of Acas." He added: "If the company lifts the cuts agenda that it is imposing on its workers, then our offer still stands." Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond earlier warned of a risk to the future of Grangemouth if the current stand-off continues. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, he said the longer site remained "idle and cold" the more difficult things would become. Mr Salmond met with Ineos and Unite representatives on Thursday. Ineos said shutting down the Grangemouth complex had cost the company £20m so far. The firm had put proposals over pay and pensions to workers at the complex, which has 1,400 employees and many more contractors. A letter outlining the proposed changes - which includes freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016 - was being couriered to employees on Friday. Unite claimed the company had told staff they could lose their jobs and be reemployed on poorer terms unless they agreed to give up their final salary pension, and accept pay freezes and pay cuts, by 18:00 on Monday. The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans. </body>

      <title>Pilots 'did not spot' reduced speed</title>
      <description>Air accident investigators say a reduction in air speed that caused the fatal crash of a helicopter off Shetland was not noticed by the pilots.</description>

      <body>Air accident investigators have said a reduction in airspeed that caused the fatal crash of a helicopter off Shetland was not noticed by the pilots. Four people died when the Super Puma crashed on approach to Sumburgh Airport on 23 August. The ongoing Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) investigation has so far found no evidence of a technical fault. The investigation will now focus on the effectiveness of pilot monitoring of instruments and the training of crews. An interim report published by the AAIB said that, as the helicopter approached to within 2.3 nautical miles of the airport, the commander noted that its airspeed had reduced to 80 knots. The commander increased the collective pitch, intending to maintain the speed. But the helicopter's airspeed reduced to below 80 knots, unobserved by the crew. A short time later, there was an automated audio call of "check height", which was acknowledged by the commander, and then a comment by the co-pilot to draw the commander's attention to the airspeed. At this time, the helicopter's airspeed was only 35 knots and reducing. There was then a second automated call of "check height" followed by a "100 feet" automated call. The report stated: "At some point the commander saw the sea, but he was unable to arrest the helicopter's descent and it struck the water shortly thereafter. "The co-pilot, realising that the helicopter was about to enter the water, armed the helicopter's flotation system. "After striking the surface the helicopter rapidly inverted, but remained afloat, the flotation equipment having successfully deployed". There were 18 people on board the helicopter at the time. Sarah Darnley, 45, from Elgin, Gary McCrossan, 59, from Inverness, Duncan Munro, 46, from Bishop Auckland, and George Allison, 57, from Winchester, lost their lives in the incident. The AAIB investigators also called for a review of rescue operations in the water surrounding Sumburgh Airport. A number of lifeboats and helicopters were sent to the scene, but the report said one rescue boat supposed to leave from a slipway to the west of the airport was delayed due to tidal conditions and instead had to leave from the south of the airport. It took almost an hour to reach the crash scene. The report said: "It is recommended that the Civil Aviation Authority reviews the risks associated with the current water rescue provision for the area of sea to the west of Sumburgh Airport and take appropriate action." </body>

      <title>£10m grant letter 'was misleading'</title>

      <body>A letter from a minister to a football club about a £10m grant was described as "misleading" by a senior official. Nelson McCausland wrote the letter in 2011, apparently at the request of First Minister Peter Robinson. Noting that an IFA proposal included plans for £10m for Glentoran, the then sports minister said money was agreed by the Executive and "secure". Documents obtained under freedom of information show that senior civil servants disagreed. PDF download Letter and related documents[978kb] The officials were supported by Mr McCausland's successor as sports minister, Carál Ní Chuilín of Sinn Féin, who said the funding commitment could not be upheld. In January 2011, Mr Robinson was involved in the financial rescue of the club by a mystery benefactor. According to documents, three months later he asked Mr McCausland to write to the club's chairman Terence Brannigan. The letter, sent in April 2011, stated that "the IFA proposal included plans for a £10m grant to Glentoran FC for stadium development, subject to a viable business case". Mr McCausland said the executive had made budget allocations based on the IFA proposal. He said these had been passed by the assembly and that the executive had "also agreed funding into the next budget period". However, a senior civil servant at the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure wrote an internal memo in May 2011 disputing a number of assertions that he described as "misleading" or "potentially misleading". "I do not believe the executive were agreeing a specific allocation to Glentoran as they had not been asked the question," he concluded. In October 2011, another official, the department's permanent secretary, also wrote a memo stating: "At the request of the first minister, Nelson McCausland wrote to Terence Brannigan confirming £10m funding had been earmarked for Glentoran". The letter also said Glentoran would have the opportunity to bid for up to £4m earmarked for a national training centre. She said: "It is the view of DCAL officials that these assertions may not be borne out so definitively by the executive decision." Minutes of a meeting involving the current minister, Carál Ní Chuilín, record her stating reasons why the executive would not have been in a position to be more specific about the allocation of funds. "Consequently," she concluded, "any commitments of funding given in advance of the policy development could not be upheld." She confirmed this in a statement to the BBC: "A strategy for the development of local soccer is being pursued. "A range of research and business cases will be developed in due course, including an assessment of facilities by the IFA. These will help to inform DCAL's decisions on budget bids during the next Comprehensive Spending Review." "DCAL is neither bound by, nor committed to, any notional or specific award of funding to any club's development plans at this stage." A DUP spokesman said: "The letter that Nelson sent was stating a number of facts. How people interpreted the letter is a matter for them to explain. "Details of the funding packages for the sports bodies were negotiated by ministers and a paper submitted to the executive alongside a detailed discussion held at an executive meeting. The civil servants, to whom you refer, were not present at the executive meeting or during discussions between ministers." </body>

      <body>The senior coroner for NI has warned the chief constable and the justice minister he will not allow further delays in the inquest into the death of Castlederg teenager Arlene Arkinson. John Leckey was speaking at a preliminary hearing into her death. Arlene, who was 15, went missing in August 1994 and her body has never been found. After many delays an inquest has now been set for 28 April next year at Omagh Court House. However, on Friday it emerged that less than half the documents the PSNI are due to give to the court and the Arkinson family have been handed over. A barrister blamed the delay on a busy summer, with the G8 summit, the flags dispute and the marching season. Setting a deadline for the end of this month for the handover, the coroner replied that if Chief Constable Matt Baggott did not have the necessary resources, he should ask Justice Minister David Ford for more. He also said he hoped Mr Ford would make an early decision on legal aid for Robert Howard, whom he described as a prime suspect in the murder of Arlene Arkinson. </body>

      <body>A woman has died after a house fire in Rhondda Cynon Taf in which the property had partly collapsed, said the fire service. Firefighters tackled the blaze in Abernant, Aberdare, for three hours from shortly after 07:30 BST. South Wales Police said the cause of the fire was unknown and was under investigation. The force said next of kin had been informed and were being supported "at this difficult time". "A body believed to be that of a female has been found inside the property but has not been formally identified," said South Wales Police in a statement. "Next of kin have been informed and are being supported at this difficult time. "A police cordon will remain overnight." South Wales Fire and Rescue Service officers are also investigating. Assistant chief fire officer Andy Thomas said crews had been faced with a "difficult" rescue attempt. "Despite the tremendous efforts of the fire crews, the severity of the fire and the partial collapse of the building meant crews were faced with a very difficult incident and, unfortunately, a fatality has been confirmed at the scene," he said. He added: "I would first of all like to express my sincere condolences to the family and friends of the deceased that has sadly lost their life during the house fire today." He said he could not give any further information on the identity of the person who had died. South Wales fire service said five appliances and two water bowsers had attended the scene. A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesperson said: "We were called at 7.41am to reports of a fire at a property in Aberdare. "We sent two rapid response vehicles, two emergency ambulances and the hazardous area response team to the scene, where sadly one person was pronounced dead." </body>

      <title>Woman jailed for 900 handbags theft</title>
      <description>A woman who stole more than 900 designer handbags worth up to £135,000 and sold them on eBay is jailed for 18 months.</description>

      <body>A 48-year-old woman who stole 905 designer handbags over a three-year period has been jailed for 18 months. Jayne Rand, from Swindon in Wiltshire, carried out a nationwide "campaign of shoplifting" and took handbags and purses worth up to £135,000. She was eventually caught at a shopping centre in Cwmbran, south Wales. Her haul, Newport Crown Court heard, included bags made by Mulberry, Prada, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Dior and Burberry valued at up to £200 each. Rand sold some of the bags on online auction site eBay. She is known to have made £88,000 in sales from the stolen bags but their retail value would have been closer to double that figure. On Friday, Judge Rhys Rowlands told her she had "made a business of stealing" and her actions had been "planned, calculated and persistent". "I have not seen such a case before. You travelled significant distances to steal from up and down the country and target high value bags," the judge added. The court heard how Rand, a housewife and mother of two, was able to carry out her crimes and even stole to order for some of her online buyers. Prosecutor David Wooler said: "She stole handbags from all over the country. "She targeted department stores including Debenhams, House of Fraser and John Lewis. "Her usual method of theft was to go into the store without a bag, pick up one from the display, walk around with it on her shoulder for a while, then simply walk out of the store. "Sometimes she would have to remove the security tag, but usually she wouldn't have to." But her crime spree came to an end when security staff at a shopping centre in Cwmbran caught her and alerted police. The court heard after officers began to investigate they found she had listed a significant number of handbags for sale on eBay priced competitively. "Her house was full of sealable grey delivery bags and Post Office receipts," the prosecutor told the court. "She set up a legitimate business and no one, not even her husband, knew what she was doing. "Rand told police she needed money to fund her lifestyle." She admitted stealing 905 handbags and four purses from House of Fraser and various retail businesses between December 2009 and December 2012. She also admitted converting criminal assets from 838 handbags. The court was told the cost price of the handbags was in excess of £130,000 but the prosecutor said the retail price would be much greater. In her defence, Andrew Taylor, said: "She bitterly regrets everything that she's done." "She became almost immune to the feeling of wrongdoing. "She was almost addicted to stealing high-value bags in an attempt to keep the ship afloat. "She never expected to find herself in such dire circumstances and out of desperation took this course of action." During sentencing, Judge Rhys Rowlands told Rand: "This was a remarkably serious raft of thefts which only ended when you were caught stealing a valuable handbag from a store in Cwmbran. "How you got away with it for so long without being caught was deeply remarkable. "You showed professionalism and that is why you went undetected for so long. "You travelled the country with the sole purpose of theft and you made a successful albeit dishonest business of selling stolen handbags. "The values are quite outside of what the court comes across even from professional shoplifting gangs. "It's sad and unusual to see a woman of 48 with previous good character up before the court for such a protracted and serious dishonesty. "Many, many businesses get into difficulty but most behave honestly and do not turn to this sort of crime." PC Rhodri Parry, from Gwent Police, said: "Crimes against retailers impact all of the community as it has the effect of making goods more expensive for everyone else. "We are pleased that the individual responsible for a sustained series of thefts from local retailers and those further afield has now been sentenced for her crimes. She will now be subject to a proceeds of crime inquiry." A House of Fraser spokesperson said Rand's behaviour "impacted a number of retailers across the UK". "We commend the vigilance of our Cwmbran store team who identified the woman as acting suspiciously, acted promptly and were supported by the police with her arrest," the spokesperson added. </body>

A fifth suspect was arrested on Friday after police issued an identikit photo. His arrest sparked violent protests outside a police station in Diepsloot as hundreds of demonstrators demanded he be handed over to the crowd. Police fired rubber bullets to disperse those who had blocked a road, were throwing stones and burning tyres. The bodies of two girls, aged two and three, were found dumped in community toilets on Tuesday morning. The girls, who were cousins, went missing on Saturday from outside their home while playing with friends.

      <title>US pressed over drone attack data</title>
      <description>A UN investigator, Ben Emmerson, calls on the US to provide greater transparency about its drone strikes and civilian casualties.</description>

      <body>A United Nations investigator has called on the US to make public its data about drone strikes and civilian casualties. Ben Emmerson has spent the year travelling to countries where the strikes have taken place, and speaking to US officials. He says the involvement of the CIA creates "an almost insurmountable obstacle to transparency". In Pakistan he was told at least 400 civilians had been killed since 2004. The Obama administration's policy of using drones in places such as Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen - chiefly to carry out deadly missile attacks against suspected militants - has come under increasing criticism. Mr Emmerson, a British lawyer who acts as the UN special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, has prepared an interim report for the UN's Human Rights Council on his work since January 2013. In the report he writes that he cannot accept that national security considerations justify the US withholding its own data on civilian casualties from the pilotless operations. He also says there a number of legal questions relating to the use of drones which urgently need to be resolved internationally. However he does conclude that, if used in compliance with humanitarian law, remotely piloted aircraft are capable of reducing the risk of civilian casualties in armed conflict. The BBC's security correspondent, Gordon Corera, says the fear highlighted in Mr Emmerson's report is that without any consensus on how drones could be used, their use will become increasingly widespread and dangerous. Drones may be controversial, but the signs are that they are here to stay and many more countries may begin to use them, our correspondent adds. </body>

      <body>Militants have attacked a heavily-fortified international compound on the outskirts of the Afghan capital, Kabul, security sources say. The attack started when a car exploded at the gate of the compound, known as Green Village, which houses international diplomats and military contractors. A woman and up to four children in a car that was passing were killed. Security guards then exchanged gunfire with insurgents, who were overpowered. Some reports say the militants managed to get inside the compound. Military officials said the explosion outside the compound destroyed vehicles belonging to international forces. There are no reports of any international casualties. The attack began when a suicide bomber in a car detonated explosives as a foreign convoy was leaving the Green Village. Most of the residents are contractors working as security guards for international agencies. Green Village was last attacked by a car bomb in May 2012, killing eight. </body>

      <body>US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden has insisted he took no classified documents to Russia when he fled to Moscow from Hong Kong in June. He told the New York Times he had given all the papers to journalists in Hong Kong and had kept no copies. Mr Snowden, who worked for two US spy agencies, also said no confidential information had been passed to China. The US authorities want Mr Snowden extradited to face trial, but Russia has refused to hand him over. The Russian authorities gave him a one-year visa earlier this year after he claimed asylum. Mr Snowden told the US newspaper that he did not take any of the documents because it would not have been in the public interest. "What would be the unique value of personally carrying another copy of the materials onward," he said. Claims had surfaced in media reports that China was likely to have gained some intelligence from the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor before he left Hong Kong. Some analysts had suggested he was working with Chinese intelligence, while others said he was working with the Russians. But Mr Snowden rebuffed these claims, saying: "There's a zero per cent chance the Russians or Chinese have received any documents." He said his last job for the NSA had focused on China, and he had "access to every target", so he felt confident that the data was safe from Chinese agencies. The New York Times report said its interview was conducted over several days via encrypted networks. The information leaked by Mr Snowden has led to claims of systematic spying by the NSA and CIA on a global scale of governments, businesses and members of the public. Targets have included rivals like China and Russia, as well as close allies like the EU and Brazil. The NSA was also forced to admit it captured email and phone data from millions of Americans. </body>

      <title>Protesters disrupt French schools</title>
      <description>Secondary schools in Paris and other French cities are again disrupted by pupils protesting at the removal of two foreign students from France.</description>

      <body>Schools in Paris and other French cities are being disrupted again by pupil protests over the removal of two foreign students from France. Protesters gathered on the French capital's Bastille square, traditional meeting-place of the left, as some demonstrators clashed with riot police. Divisions have appeared among the ruling Socialists over the affair. It has emerged that the father of a Roma schoolgirl at the centre of the row lied over his asylum claim. However, the anger in France has focused on the way Leonarda Dibrani, 15, was removed from a school bus to be expelled along with her family earlier this month. They had been living in the eastern region of Doubs for several years. While President Francois Hollande has remained silent, his partner, Valerie Trierweiler, spoke out on Friday to question the girl's treatment. Protesters are calling for the resignation of Interior Minister Manuel Valls, who has defended the authorities' tough line and takes a tough policy towards Roma immigrants in general. The minister has cut short an official visit to the French Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe in order to return to Paris, where findings of an inquiry into the handling of the affair are expected to be ready shortly. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault has said the family will be allowed to return if "any fault is found" with the expulsion order. There is also anger over the removal of Khatchik Kachatryan, a 19-year-old student in Paris who was expelled on Saturday to Armenia after reportedly being arrested for shoplifting, at which point police discovered he had entered France illegally. Police fired tear gas at some protesters in Paris but the demonstration in the Nation-Bastille area appeared to be passing off peacefully in the main. Pupils partially blocked entry to as many as 20 secondary schools in Paris while allowing other pupils to enter to attend classes, the pupils' union Fidl said. Outside one school in central Paris, the Lycee Charlemagne, wheelie bins were used to block the entrance. A banner read "Jotters not [ID] papers". One protester at the school, named as David, told Reuters: "We're a bit lost, we say our country is the country of human rights, a country which welcomes people and we still deport a 15-year-old girl and a 19-year-old student to a country... that they don't know and where they have no future." There appeared to be less protest activity in other French cities but some schools were affected in Marseille, Lyon and Rouen. Speaking on a visit to Angers, Ms Trierweiler said "certain boundaries cannot be crossed" and "the school gate is one of them". Education Minister Vincent Peillon told French radio that it was wrong for the authorities to have detained the girl while she was on a trip. "What is certain is that when one is in the setting of a class outing, and that was the case, you are part of school life... and you can't intervene during that time," he said. "That means schools are kind of a sanctuary." Opinion polls suggest Mr Valls is the most popular member of President Hollande's government with the wider public. His critics point to the fact that he himself was born in Spain. However, he was naturalised in France more than 20 years ago. Leonarda Dibrani and her family have been given a flat and a small allowance in the Kosovo city of Mitrovica, where they have been speaking to French journalists about the shock of being sent to a region where they are strangers, unable to speak Albanian. Resat Dibrani told media in Kosovo, where he and his family were expelled, that he had lied to the French authorities when he said his family was from the breakaway Serbian region. In fact, only he was born there while, according to him, his daughter Leonarda and other members of his family were born in Italy. "We lied to the authorities when we said we were from Kosovo," he told Reuters news agency. It emerged in France that the father was investigated by French authorities for allegedly beating his family. Little is known about the fate of Mr Kachatryan, though it was reported that he had been detained on his return to Armenia for evading military service. </body>

      <body>Four men in Chile have been convicted of murder for torturing and beating to death a young gay man in a Santiago park earlier this year. Judge Juan Carlos Urrutia said the four killers of Daniel Zamudio showed "total disrespect for human life". They broke Mr Zamudio's leg with a heavy stone, beat him up with bottles and carved swastikas into his body with broken glass before walking away. The four are due to be sentenced on 28 October. Patricio Ahumada, Alejandro Angulo, Raul Lopez and Fabian Mora are facing lengthy prison terms. The attack shocked Chile and led Congress in March to approve a law against hate crimes that had been waiting to be voted for seven years. "It is typical of us, Chileans, that an accident has to happen for us to approve a law. My son will not come back, but this case may end up being good for Chile," said Daniel's father, Ivan Zamudio. He was in court to hear the verdict, alongside Daniel's mother, Jacqueline Vera. "Of course I will not forgive them," Ivan Zamudio told El Mercurio newspaper. Daniel Zamudio was attacked on the night of 2 March at the San Borja de Alameda park in the Chilean capital. He was left for dead after an ordeal that lasted for several hours. He was taken to hospital with serious injuries and died there 25 days later. Gay activist Rolando Jimenez, president of Chile's Gay Liberation and Integration Movement, told the Associated Press news agency that he was "satisfied" with the ruling. "There's a before and an after the Zamudio case,'' said Mr Jimenez. </body>

      <title>Brazilian oil workers on strike</title>
      <description>Union leaders say 90% of Brazil's state oil company are on strike against planned auctions for rights to explore the huge offshore Libra oilfield.</description>

      <body>Oil production in Brazil has been disrupted by a strike against a planned auction for rights to explore a huge offshore oilfield near Rio de Janeiro. Union leaders say 90% of employees of the state oil company, Petrobras, joined the strike on Thursday. Forty-two platforms and several refineries have been affected. The unions say the Libra oilfield auction will damage national interests by allowing foreign companies to share production rights with Petrobras. They have taken legal action to try to halt the sale, which is due to take place on Monday. The 40,000 Petrobras employees are also demanding a pay rise and changes to plans to have some of the services contracted out to private companies. "Our aim is not to hurt the population, but we will carry on with the strike for an indefinite period, until our demands are met," said José Antonio de Moraes, president of the Unified Federation of Oil Workers (FUP). In a statement, Petrobras said it had taken "all the measures needed to guarantee operations and the supply of products to the market". There were demonstrations outside the Petrobras headquarters in Rio de Janeiro and government buildings in the capital, Brasilia. Mines and Energy Minister Edison Lobao could not reach his ministry, which was surrounded by demonstrators. "The country understands the strikes. I regret I was not able to work today. But these things happen," he said. Mr Lobao said that the auction will go ahead as planned on Monday despite the industrial action. Petrobras and six foreign companies are taking part: China National Petroleum Corporation, Anglo-Dutch Shell, Colombia's Ecopetrol, , France's Total, China National Offshore Oil Corporation and a consortium made up of Spain's Repsol and China's Sinopec . The Libra field is a deepwater oilfield in the Santos basin, some 230km (140 miles) off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. It belongs to the Brazilian National Petroleum Agency (ANP) and is part of huge oil reserves discovered in 2010 under a layer of rock, sand and salt beneath the seabed. The government estimates "the volume of recoverable oil belonging to the nation could vary from 3.7 billion to 15 billion barrels, with the most likely estimate being 7.9 billion barrels". National Petroleum Agency president Magda Chambriard said she expected production to peak in Libra at 1.4 million barrels a day in a decade. </body>

      <body>A senior Military Intelligence officer has been killed in eastern Syria, state media and activists say. State television reported on Thursday that Gen Jamaa Jamaa had died while "carrying out his national duties" and "pursuing terrorists" in Deir al-Zour. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said he was shot by a sniper during clashes between government and rebel forces in the city's Rashdiya district. Gen Jamaa was close to President Bashar al-Assad, the UK-based group added. He was commander of Syrian Military Intelligence's headquarters in Lebanon's capital, Beirut, when former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was assassinated there in 2005. Gen Jamaa was questioned as part of a UN inquiry into the killing after the Syrian withdrawal. Damascus has always denied any involvement, although five members of the allied Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah have been indicted. In 2006, the US Treasury named Gen Jamaa as a Specially Designated National, saying he had "significantly contributed to the Syrian government's military and security presence in Lebanon". Al-Arabiya TV reported that at the time of his death Gen Jamaa was head of Military Intelligence in Deir al-Zour province, and was one of the most powerful security officials in the country. The Aisha bin al-Sadiq Brigade said one of its fighters had shot him. The UK-based Syrian Observatory said he was killed during clashes between troops and members of the Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda-affiliated group, and Liwa al-Fatihun min Ard al-Sham. Al-Nusra fighters also executed 10 soldiers captured during the fighting, it added. There were reportedly air strikes and fierce clashes overnight in several districts of Deir al-Zour after state television reported Gen Jamaa's death. Another 20 soldiers and seven rebels died on Friday during an assault on air-defence base near the towns of Hujaira and Obaida, in the northern province of Aleppo, according to the Syrian Observatory. At least 19 people, including 10 children, were killed when shells hit a vehicle and a residential building in Tal Aran, also in Aleppo province, on Friday, the group added. The town is not far from the al-Safira military complex, which is believed to house a major chemical weapons facility. </body>

      <body>Masked gunmen have shot dead a Libyan military police commander in the city of Benghazi, officials have said. Ahmed al-Barghathi, the head of the military police's investigative division, was shot several times as he left his house for Friday prayers. No group has admitted carrying out the attack. Many security officials have been targeted by gunmen since the end of the 2011 war that toppled Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's government. In the past year alone, more than 80 people, many of whom were high-profile military and police figures or retired army generals, have been assassinated in eastern Libya. The BBC's Rana Jawad in the capital, Tripoli, says no-one ever admits carrying out the killings. and arrests are rarely made. Earlier this week two members of an infantry brigade were killed following an attack on their base in Benghazi. Local media reported that their throats were slit. And in the eastern city of Derna on Thursday morning, a local army commander widely known for his role in leading an anti-Gaddafi brigade was shot dead. Mr Barghathi was one of many officials who rose to prominence after fighting against Gaddafi's forces. He was reportedly on holiday in Benghazi when he was shot. "Several shots hit Ahmed al-Barghathi. He was brought to hospital but later died there," a security source said. Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan recently called on Western powers to help stop the spread of militancy in Libya. </body>

      <body>Canada and the European Union have struck a free trade agreement aimed at boosting growth and employment. The deal will lower tariffs, streamline regulation, and cut red tape. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso agreed the deal at a meeting in Brussels on Friday. Mr Barroso said they had reached a "breakthrough in negotiations" to achieve "a great agreement for both the European Union and Canada". The deal still requires approval by parliaments and EU member states. Once approved, the agreement aims to make it easier for companies in Canada and the 28-member EU bloc to invest in and sell to each other. The European Union is Canada's second-largest trading partner behind the US. Mr Harper said the agreement was "the biggest (trade) deal our country has ever made". It will give Canada access to a market of some 500 million people in the EU, making it bigger even than the country's North American Free Trade Agreement signed with the US and Mexico. The European Commission expects the deal to increase bilateral trade in goods and services by a fifth to 25.7bn euros ($35bn; £21.7bn) a year. The commission is negotiating trade pacts with more than 80 countries on behalf of the bloc's members following the collapse of the Doha global trade talks. </body>

      <body>A strike by workers of a major San Francisco-area rail transit system has snarled the morning commute for hundreds of thousands of workers. Overnight negotiations between the labour unions and Bay Area Rapid Transit (Bart) reached an impasse just hours before the morning rush. The city bolstered bus and ferry service to meet the demand of more than 400,000 affected commuters, and bridges and highways were clogged. It is the second Bart strike this year. Commuters lined up before dawn to catch charter buses into San Francisco, the city at the centre of the 4.3 million-population metropolitan area. City officials estimated the buses could only transport 6,000 people per day. Traffic on San Francisco's bridges also appeared heavier than normal. "They must realise how many thousands, hundreds of thousands of people they're throwing into chaos," a resident told local media. The two unions involved in the dispute represent nearly 2,400 train operators, station agents, maintenance workers and other staff. Agreement was reportedly near on Thursday on the key sticking points of pay, healthcare and pension issues, said Roxanne Sanchez, president of the Service Employees International Union Local 1021. But talks broke down just hours later, reportedly over issues including overtime scheduling. Ms Sanchez said management had rejected a union suggestion to take the remaining issues to arbitration, prompting the walkout. It is the second Bart worker strike in four months. After a previous strike in July, California Governor Jerry Brown ordered a 60-day cooling-off period, which ended on Sunday. A federal mediator has been working since then with Bart and the unions. Bart spokeswoman Alicia Trost said the rail operator had been inundated with calls and emails this week from commuters frustrated they had not been given earlier notice about whether the trains would run. </body>

      <body>New powers to crack down on modern slavery are to be introduced in a bid to end the trafficking of hundreds of men, women and children to the UK every year. One measure includes the introduction of a maximum life sentence for the worst cases of exploitation. At present the conviction rate is one of the lowest in Europe, according to the Human Trafficking Foundation. The BBC has spoken to Adriana, whose name has been changed to protect her identity. She was orphaned at 17, and forced into a violent marriage when another man promised her a better life in the UK. She told the BBC's Sophie Long how she accepted but on arrival was raped, imprisoned and kept as a sex slave. </body>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <description>Your stories of being 'chronically lonely' in the UK</description>

      <body>Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said it is a source of "national shame" that as many as 800,000 people in England are "chronically lonely". Here some people share their stories of feeling isolated and alone in modern society. "I used to run my own business, I had shops - cafes, chip shops and even a toffee shop in the war when I was very young. I was used to seeing lots of people every day and having lots of conversations all the time. I love company and miss that terribly now. The last two years in particular have been very bad. My son works and sees me as often as he can - work permitting - and my daughter-in-law visits me once a week. I have a cleaner that comes in once a week and a dear girl who comes to keep me company. I know I am lucky, that there are people worse off than me. But it's in between those visits that there are a lot of hours to fill in the day. My husband died on Christmas Eve in 1970 - he was only 40 and I was 39. I used to have a lot of friends, many of them were younger than me, but as time goes by, more and more of them seem to succumb to cancer or some other illness and they have died now. But I'm still here. It doesn't seem fair though. My brain is fine but my body is giving up. I just keep going and I worry in the future it will only get worse. I don't fancy going to these social clubs for older people - half of the people in there have lost their minds. I love speaking to younger people though, about anything. It keeps me young. I tell everyone to go and live their life while they are still fit and healthy." "I would consider myself as chronically lonely - my computer and television are my only windows to the outside world. I'm ex-forces and suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). I see my mental health nurse every two weeks and that is basically my only contact with anybody. I don't have any family and I live in a rural area in Norfolk. There isn't much to do here. Everyone here is much younger than me and I see age as an definite communication barrier, and there are also lots of Polish people moving into the community. My PTSD makes me wary of people. When I first left the forces in 1989 I became a Tesco manager and had lots of friends, but my social status dropped when I left the job due to health reasons and people didn't want to speak to me as much. I got this social housing in Norfolk two years ago. I want to move to a larger area about 12 miles away where there is a cinema but I can't do that because I don't meet the criteria and I'm not a high enough priority. It's a Catch 22. I am very unhappy and depressed to the point of clinical depression. I see people walking around hand in hand and I want that. But it only makes it worse, and I feel more resentment towards others. I'd describe myself as a recluse. I'm almost a prisoner in my own home and it's been like that for two years. It's not just a pensioner thing. I'm 51 and considered not elderly at all, therefore not looked at as a person needing care." "I am only 67 and I have a nice home and all the trappings. But I have neighbours who don't speak and I have no family at all. I have a friend who lives a few miles away but he never gets in touch. No-one visits, no-one rings. It's been like this for eight years. Every day is the same and I have to discipline myself to cope with it. I exercise, I do some gardening and my housework and go walking. The only time I see someone is when I shop. I put on my best clothes to go shopping and always look very smart. But once I get home there is no escape from the loneliness. I go to bed at 8.30pm as I'm so fed up with the day - evenings are just terrible. This will be the seventh Christmas on my own and my birthday is Christmas Eve. If I got ill I do not know what would happen. You don't have to be really old to know lonely. People who are surrounded by family have no idea." </body>

      <body>This week at Westminster has been dominated by one topic: energy prices. It is a case study of the biggest theme in politics at the moment, the cost of living. With British Gas joining energy provider SSE in hiking its prices, what are people feeling the squeeze and fearing the cold supposed to do? Enter, stage left, the humble jumper. And welcome to a brief snapshot of how headlines sometimes appear despite what might have emerged out of the lips of politicians and their advisers. Energy Secretary Ed Davey spent much of Thursday touring TV and radio studios criticising British Gas and suggesting people should shop around for the best energy deal. In an interview on the BBC's Newsnight, he was asked about what happened in the Davey household. Did Mr Davey, presenter Jeremy Paxman asked, wear a jumper? "I am sure people do wear jumpers, I wear jumpers at home, but you are missing the point here Jeremy, we do need to help people with their bills, I am extremely worried about them, we can use competition the way we have, we can make our homes warmer and use less electricity and gas by going more energy efficient," said Mr Davey. Cue headlines suggesting the energy secretary said wear a jumper. Great story. Except he didn't say this. Mr Davey was asked about jumpers. Mr Davey mentioned jumpers. But Mr Davey didn't say you or I should wear a jumper. Fast forward 12 hours to Friday's briefing for Westminster journalists, which is conducted by one of the prime minister's official spokesmen. The Daily Mirror - which is no fan of the coalition government - chased this theme with some vigour. The clear aim of the questions was to attempt to get an answer along the lines of "the prime minister tells you to wear jumper". If he'd said that, I'd have been jumping at the chance to get on the television, radio and online to tell it. But he didn't. Here is the exchange, as I scribbled it in my notebook: Reporter: "Does the prime minister wear a jumper at home?" Official Spokesman: "The prime minister doesn't tend to give fashion tips." Several further questions along the same lines came along, which didn't get very far. The spokesman was then asked about what the PM thought of charities giving advice that perhaps people should consider wrapping up warm. Here was the response: "Clearly, he is not going to prescribe necessarily the actions individuals should take about that. But if people are giving that advice, that is something that people may wish to consider." Next came the headlines claiming the prime minister was suggesting people should wear a jumper. Great story. Except the spokesman did not say this. Labour leapt at the chance to have their say, claiming Downing Street was in chaos and offering Ed Miliband for interview. Downing Street then issued a statement: "To be clear, it is entirely false to suggest the Prime Minister would advise people they should wear jumpers to stay warm. Any suggestion to the contrary is mischief-making." And so concludes the story of a story which isn't really a story at all. </body>

      <body>To his millions of fans, American cyclist and cancer survivor Lance Armstrong was more than just a great sportsman, he was an inspiration. To the film-maker who documented his spectacular fall from grace, he was a master storyteller. But were his supporters too ready to believe the fairytale? The story of the charismatic Texan cyclist who recovered from life-threatening cancer and went on to win the Tour de France a record seven successive times was one of the greatest tales in sporting history. In 2009, Lance Armstrong attempted to write another chapter into the legend by coming out of professional retirement to compete in the Tour again at the age of 37. He granted Oscar-winning filmmaker Alex Gibney rare access to his inner circle to chronicle the comeback. For Gibney, the experience was akin to being embedded with the military in a warzone. "When you're with a group of soldiers in Iraq or Afghanistan you're going to end up feeling part of their unit," he told me. "I don't think that's necessarily wrong. The trick is how to come out of that with some broader perspective - but it's intoxicating while you're in the middle of it." Gibney admits the "them and us" mentality inside Lance Armstrong's Astana cycling team encouraged a kind of Stockholm syndrome. Anyone who questioned his repeated denials that he had used performance-enhancing drugs came to be viewed as the enemy. "I did begin to feel that some people on the outside were a bit fanatical about the subject of whether Lance had doped," he says. "You can't help but take on the vibe of the team." Through the media and in the courts, Armstrong aggressively pursued critics who continued to question whether he was riding clean. Alex Gibney watched as his subject attempted to maintain control over the powerful and lucrative myth he had constructed. "I think the truth in the mind of someone who is a master storyteller does become elastic," he suggests. "There's a moment in the film when Lance loses in Verbier to Alberto Contador (on stage 15 of the 2009 Tour de France) and he says to me 'I'm sorry I screwed up your documentary.' "I don't think that was just banter. I think that was Lance's way of saying 'you came to me to deliver the fairytale that everyone's come to believe that I can deliver and I failed. I'm not going to win. I'm not going to be first and I'm sorry.'" After Armstrong's 2009 comeback, in which he finished third, the myth began to disintegrate. Former teammates went public with allegations of drug use. The US Anti-Doping Agency accused Armstrong of running the most sophisticated and extensive doping scheme in professional sports history. He finally came clean in an interview with talk show host Oprah Winfrey last January, in which he admitted taking banned substances and undergoing prohibited blood transfusions during all of his victorious Tour de France campaigns. In earlier films such as Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room, Taxi to the Dark Side and Mea Maxima Culpa, Alex Gibney has explored the abuse of power by big businesses, the military and the Catholic Church. In his latest film, it's Armstrong's rewriting of his own personal life story, a story that inspired and gave hope to cancer patients around the world, that Gibney finds particularly difficult to accept. "It's an abuse of storytelling power," he says. "He told a story that everyone wanted to believe in too much. He knew how much everybody wanted to believe in it. "He made the lie so enormous, so all-encompassing, that he couldn't dial it back. His only choice was to go forward and make it even bigger." So he carried on cheating, winning Tour after Tour. Stripped of those seven titles, pursued by lawyers seeking to reclaim prize and sponsorship money, Lance Armstrong's reputation as a sportsman is now in ruins. He has been banned from competitive cycling for life. For Alex Gibney, Lance Armstrong's epic downfall should serve as a cautionary tale. Even heroes, he argues, need to accept their flaws. "There can be inspirational stories that are messy," he says. "Spiderman to me is a more intriguing tale than Superman because you reckon with Peter Parker's dark past and to some extent his deep-seated anger rather than the pure hero that Superman is. "When we're told stories that seem too good to be true we should say to ourselves, 'Hey, maybe this is too good to be true.'" Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Where the penalty for miscarriage is jail</title>
      <description>A country where a woman may be jailed for losing a child</description>

      <body>El Salvador has one of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the world. A side-effect is that women who suffer miscarriages are sometimes suspected of inducing an abortion - and can even be jailed for murder. Glenda Xiomara Cruz was crippled by abdominal pain and heavy bleeding in the early hours of 30 October 2012. The 19-year-old from Puerto El Triunfo, eastern El Salvador, went to the nearest public hospital where doctors said she had lost her baby. It was the first she knew about the pregnancy as her menstrual cycle was unbroken, her weight practically unchanged, and a pregnancy test in May 2012 had been negative. Four days later she was charged with aggravated murder - intentionally murdering the 38-to-42 week foetus - at a court hearing she was too sick to attend. The hospital had reported her to the police for a suspected abortion. After two emergency operations and three weeks in hospital she was moved to Ilopango women's prison on the outskirts of the capital San Salvador. Then last month she was sentenced to 10 years in jail, the judge ruling that she should have saved the baby's life. Her lawyer, Dennis Munoz Estanley, says the legal system has an inbuilt "presumption of guilt" making it hard for women to prove their innocence. "She is yet another innocent victim of our unjust and discriminatory legal system which jails poor, young women who suffer obstetric complications for murder on the most flimsy evidence," he says. Xiomara's father describes the conviction as a "terrible injustice". He testified in court that his daughter had endured years of domestic violence at the hands of her partner. And yet the prosecution - which sought a 50-year jail term - relied heavily on this man's allegation that she had intentionally killed the foetus. Xiomara has not seen her four-year-old daughter since the miscarriage. El Salvador is one of five countries with a total ban on abortion, along with Nicaragua, Chile, Honduras and Dominican Republic. Since 1998, the law has allowed no exceptions - even if a woman is raped, her life is at risk or the foetus is severely deformed. More than 200 women were reported to the police between 2000 and 2011, of whom 129 were prosecuted and 49 convicted - 26 for murder (with sentences of 12 to 35 years) and 23 for abortion, according to research by Citizens' Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion. Seven more have been convicted since 2012. The study underlines that these women are overwhelmingly poor, unmarried and poorly educated - and they are usually denounced by public hospital staff. Not a single criminal case originated from the private health sector where thousands of abortions are believed to take place annually. Munoz has worked with 29 of the incarcerated women, helping secure the early release of eight. "Only one intentionally induced an abortion, the other 28 suffered natural obstetric complications but were jailed for murder without any direct evidence," he says. Last year when Maria Teresa Rivera suffered a miscarriage, she was sentenced to 40 years in jail for aggravated murder. Like Xiomara, Teresa, 28, had no pregnancy symptoms before sudden severe pain and bleeding, and was reported to police by the public hospital where she had sought emergency help. The scientific evidence was flimsy, according to Munoz who will soon lodge an appeal, and the prosecution relied heavily on a colleague of hers, who testified that Rivera had said she "might be" pregnant a full 11 months before the miscarriage. A textile factory worker, she was the family's only breadwinner and her eight-year-old son is now living in dire poverty with his grandmother. Cristina Quintanilla's story is different. On 24 October 2004, the 18-year-old from rural San Miguel was seven months pregnant with her second child, living with her mother in the capital to be near a hospital for the birth. Her boyfriend was working in the US, but the couple were excited buying baby clothes and saving food tokens. "Around midnight I felt an immense pain, I thought I was dying," Quintanilla says. "I was banging on the bathroom door to get my mum's attention when I felt the baby drop out. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital." Her mother called the police - a typical step for Salvadorans in an emergency, who took them to hospital. Quintanilla was given an anaesthetic, and interrogated when she came round. Then she was handcuffed to the hospital bed, charged with manslaughter and transferred to a police cell. The first judge dismissed the case, but the prosecution appealed, upgrading the charge to aggravated murder. Quintanilla was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in jail, where she was vilified as a child killer. Her son Daniel, then only four, spent four years living with his great-grandmother until Munoz succeeded in having the sentence reduced to three years. "The medical reports couldn't explain why the baby died, but the prosecutor made me out to be a criminal who could have saved my baby even though I had passed out in pain," she says. "I will never understand why they did this to me, I lost four years of my life and still don't know why I lost my baby." Morena Herrera from Citizens' Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion says these cases have had a chilling effect, with many pregnant poor women who suffer miscarriages or complications during pregnancy "too afraid to seek medical help". "I would be terrified to go a public hospital as there is no benefit of doubt given to young women, we are presumed guilty and jailed," says Bessy Ramirez, 27, from San Salvador. "We cannot even rely on health staff to put their prejudices aside and treat us confidentially." The strict abortion law has other serious human rights implications. Suicide was the most common cause of death in 2011 among 10-to-19-year-old girls, half of whom were pregnant, according to Health Ministry figures. It was also the third most common cause of maternal mortality. Earlier this year, the plight of lupus sufferer Beatriz, 22, attracted international condemnation after the Supreme Court refused to authorise an abortion, even though her life was at risk and the foetus too deformed to be viable. Beatriz's health deteriorated while the court deliberated for several months. She gave birth at 27 weeks. The baby died within hours. Individual members of the current FMLN government, particularly Health Minister Maria Isabel Rodriguez, criticised the abortion law during the controversy over Beatriz's case. But the government has made no attempt to repeal or relax the law since coming to power in 2009, as it remains popular with large parts of the conservative population, who revere the Church and pro-life religious groups such as Si a la Vida (Yes to Life). The Arena Party, which is strongly allied with the Church, is favourite to win next year's General Election. But Esther Major, Amnesty International's El Salvador expert, describes the country's abortion law as "cruel and discriminatory". "Women and girls end up in prison for being unwilling, or simply tragically unable, to carry the pregnancy to term," she says. "It makes seeking hospital treatment for complications during pregnancy, including a miscarriage, a dangerous lottery. "It cannot be in the interests of society to criminalise women and girls in this way." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>'Super fertile' Frankel earns millions at stud</title>
      <description>Frankel earns five times his race winnings in first year of breeding</description>

      <body>Unbeaten Frankel's achievements on the racecourse were legendary - but his new breeding career has already easily surpassed what he earned on the track. One year on from the final triumph of his glorious 14-race winning run, the world's top-rated racehorse is now a stallion who commands a fee of up to £125,000 a time. By the end of his first year at stud, he will have earned about £15m - five times his total prize money from racing. And like any sought-after male escort, he comes with rave reviews - "super fertile", "alpha male", "thorough gentleman". He boasts a strike rate not far off his 100% record on the track - 126 of the 133 mares who visited him are expecting foals in the first part of next year. Six of the remaining seven were pregnant before suffering early foetal deaths although a "no-foal, no-fee arrangement" usually applies. Some of the healthy potential future equine stars will be bought at public sales in December before they are even born. "Frankel has started very positively. His libido is good, and a 95% success rate for a first season stallion is very good," said Lord "Teddy" Grimthorpe, racing manager to owner Prince Khalid Abdulla. The Saudi prince retired Frankel, trained by Sir Henry Cecil, after a rapturous reception in the winner's enclosure at Ascot racecourse on British Champions Day a year ago. In the next five months the colt, now aged five, was prepared for a stallion career, which started on Valentine's Day. While his diet and regime changed ahead of his new duties, his fitness was maintained by being taken on daily seven-mile walks around Banstead Manor Stud, owned by the prince's Juddmonte Farms breeding operation. Frankel was back at his birthplace when he moved from Warren Place training yard on the edge of Newmarket, where the Cecil family flag was raised after each Group One victory, to the stud about five miles away. He has other stallions for neighbours and lives in box number two. Well, even he can't be number one all the time. From that first Valentine with the mare Midday, he has bred with some of the finest mares around in a building the size of a small village hall officially called the covering shed and nicknamed the "love shack". "Frankel has been a true gentleman throughout the season," said Juddmonte general manager Philip Mitchell. On a tour of the impeccably kept stud, staff describe the horse as "super fertile". Of his first 133 matings, 113 were the winners of races, including 38 who had scored at Group or Grade One level. Their average age, of 10, is twice his own. At the peak of his powers, he was on duty three times a day - at 7.30am, 3pm and 9pm. The first fruits of this labour of love will be on sale in December when 11 pregnant mares who visited Frankel earlier in the year go to Tattersalls horse sales in Newmarket. "We expect it to generate an enormous amount of interest and competition from breeders and owners who wish to buy into the legend that is Frankel," said Jimmy George, Tattersalls marketing director. While nothing is certain in this field, and not all great racehorses become stars at stud, bloodlines are crucial in producing future champions. "Dancing Rain, who won the Oaks in 2011, will be coming through our December sale carrying a first foal by Frankel. Even for us, that's a 'wow'," said George. "It is the ultimate package, an outstanding mare in foal to the best racehorse we've ever seen. There's no guarantees, but in thoroughbred racing, it's hard to beat that." With powerful bloodstock empires from Qatar, Ireland and Dubai among those pitting their financial muscles against each other at such sales, you might struggle to remember times are tough. Two unraced yearlings fetched a combined total of more than £8m as records tumbled during bidding earlier in October. When Frankel's offspring, or progeny as they are known in breeding circles, enter the sales ring next December, buyers will be seeking his hallmarks. "The expression used in the game is to stamp their stock. People will be looking to see Frankel in the make and shape of those foals," said George. What is it, then, that marks Frankel out as a unique thoroughbred? "You certainly know when he's in the room," jokes Grimthorpe. "He's an alpha male, no doubt about that." Grimthorpe, who was a close friend of Cecil and can casually reel off each of the great horse's victories if requested, said he had always been extremely willing to race. Frankel was even something of a tearaway as a youngster, before his exuberance was channelled expertly by the tender touch of 10-time champion trainer Cecil. "His cruising speed was equivalent to a lot of horses going flat out, and he had an incredible stride on him," said Grimthorpe. "You can see when horses were trying to match strides, they had to take one-and-a-half strides to his one. "If you look at his form, it was always franked. Horses beaten by him went on to win decent races." He is the son of 2001 Epsom Derby winner Galileo - now a prolific sire himself - and grandson of champion stallion Sadler's Wells, Frankel was champion aged two, three, and four. Those 14 victories included 10 at the highest Group One level, nine of which he won on the trot. And some at an apparent canter. He was victorious in his Champion Stakes swansong despite facing Cirrus Des Aigles, the second top-rated horse in the world, on soft ground which played much more to his opponent's strengths. Little wonder then that despite his lofty stud fee, Frankel was oversubscribed, with more than 220 potential suitors from around the world. Autumn brings about 30 mares from the southern hemisphere, including Australia, before a rest between November and February. He completed his first set of bookings in June at around the time Cecil died after a six-year battle with cancer. After the horse retired, the seriously ill Cecil would make weekly visits to see his one-time stable star at stud. The trainer may have sadly gone, but his champion racehorse's legacy is set to go on. It all has a touch of Hollywood about it. The horse named after one training legend who helped another achieve the highlight of a racing life in the sickness-ravaged twilight of his career. "The only way I can describe it is as an alignment of the stars. If you wrote the story as fiction, it would be rejected on the grounds it sounded like a fairytale," said Grimthorpe. With a standard 11-month pregnancy for mares, the first of Frankel's offspring will arrive in the early months of 2014. They will grace the track as two-year-olds in the summer of 2016, when Frankel's name will appear in racecards as the sire of a new generation of equine talent. </body>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70522000/jpg/_70522902_4773968-high_res-strictly-come-dancing.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season. This week he takes on BBC Breakfast's Susanna Reid and her Strictly Come Dancing partner Kevin Clifton. Reid is a big Crystal Palace fan who had a season ticket at Selhurst Park in the 1995-96 season, and has been on the pitch herself in the last couple of weeks. "I have some brilliant memories of watching Palace in some fantastic venues," Reid said. "I still make the occasional visit, but being on Strictly means Saturday games have been rather interrupted. "Even so, I had the chance to go and practise some moves at Selhurst Park earlier this month. "We were doing the Viennese Waltz and what we needed was a lot of space to glide, so Kev thought that would be the perfect place to expand - and be inspired by an amazing football team." Clifton has supported Scunthorpe United all his life but he also follows Chelsea because his dad is a fan of the Blues and said: "He really wanted to call me Osgood Clifton after Peter Osgood, but my mum was not having any of it!" You can see all of their predictions on Football Focus at 12:00 BST on Saturday on BBC One and the BBC Sport website in the UK, Reid and Clifton willl be back on the dance floor in Strictly Come Dancing at 18:30 BST on Saturday. A correct result is worth ONE point. A correct score earns THREE points. Last week, Lawro got nine results right, with two perfect scores. His score of 13 saw him trounce comedian, actor, writer and TV presenter Michael Palin, who got one correct result with no perfect scores, and goes to the bottom of the guest leaderboard. We're keeping a record of the total scores for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct (also at the bottom of the page). All kick-offs at 15:00 BST unless otherwise stated. Liverpool won 6-0 at St James' Park in April but things will be a lot closer this time. This Newcastle team still has a lot to prove as far as I am concerned. Loic Remy has done extremely well since arriving on loan from QPR but he was their only significant summer signing. The Magpies signed a lot of players in January but most of them have been very inconsistent. For me, they badly needed more new faces in the summer to improve the balance in the dressing room and gee some of the others up. I am going to back Alan Pardew's men to get a draw on Saturday, though. The Reds will be looking to pick up where they left off before the international break but they are away from home and a point will be a decent result. Lawro's prediction: 1-1 Reid's prediction: 1-3 Clifton's prediction: 1-2 All is well with Arsenal at the moment, and they have had more good news because it looks like Mesut Ozil will be able to play on Saturday despite picking up a knock playing for Germany in midweek. To be honest, I never worry about players when they have 'knocks' - they are different to muscle injuries because you cannot make a 'knock' any worse and, if you can stand the pain, then you are fine. I feel a bit sorry for Norwich because they did well for long spells against Chelsea last time out. They gave them a really good game, especially in the second half, but ended up being beaten 3-1. Canaries manager Chris Hughton is coming under pressure but I hope the board look at this game and realise that Arsenal are top of the league for a reason, which is because they are playing better football than anybody, have loads of creative players and are scoring goals from all areas. Norwich, in contrast, have not found it so easy to find the net - they have only scored five times in their first seven league games, compared with 14 from the Gunners. Away from home, and especially at the Emirates, are they going to be able to pose a serious goal threat? I don't think so. Hughton likes to play one up front away from home, and he is not going to change that this weekend. When I look at this game, I cannot see anything other than a comfortable home win. I only hope that Hughton does not find himself under any more pressure after this game. Norwich's next three home games are against Cardiff, West Ham and Crystal Palace and people should look at how many points they have got after that. Lawro's prediction: 2-0 Reid's prediction: 2-0 Clifton's prediction: 3-0 I cannot believe what is happening at Cardiff with the removal of their head of recruitment Iain Moody, who was a key member of manager Malky Mackay's backroom staff. I'm sorry, but what is Bluebirds' owner Vincent Tan trying to do? He should just let Mackay manage the team because they are doing fine. For Mackay's future to be insecure is absolutely ridiculous. They are becoming a laughing stock and it has nothing to do with their results; it is to do with one person. Maybe Tan should just take the manager's job himself. Tan is in danger of sending Cardiff into freefall and there is only one way that is going to end up - relegation. Chelsea have had mixed start to the season but are only a couple of points off the top of the table. We know the problems they have had with the balance of their team and boss Jose Mourinho has fired off a broadside about it, but they are still in there and looking good. This should be a comfortable afternoon for them. Lawro's prediction: 3-0 Reid's prediction: 2-1 Clifton's prediction: I think Chelsea are going to be too strong for Cardiff at Stamford Bridge and they will win 2-0. A lot of people were talking about Chelsea struggling at the start of the season but they are only a couple of points off the top of the league and have a lot of great players to choose from. They are definitely title contenders. Hull have been the Premier League's surprise package this season - not just with their results but with the way they play, which has been very easy on the eye. It will be tough for them on Saturday, though. Everton lost their unbeaten record against Manchester City last time out and they really need to bounce back. The likes of Phil Jagielka and Leighton Baines will be on a high after their exploits for England and this looks like a 2-0 Everton win to me. Lawro's prediction: 2-0 Reid's prediction: 2-1 Clifton's prediction: 2-0 Manchester United are very difficult to predict at the moment. They won at Sunderland despite not being very good, while their last home game saw West Brom go to Old Trafford and play them off the park. Yet, after watching the United players who played for England against Montenegro and Poland - and they all did extremely well - I would have to back them to beat Southampton, and comfortably. This is a good Saints team and they will go and attack, because that is their strength. But that win at the Stadium of Light, albeit slightly fortuitous because it came late, might just kick-start United under David Moyes. Lawro's prediction: 2-0 Reid's prediction: 2-1 Clifton's prediction: 3-2 Stoke made a decent start to the season but, after being unlucky not to beat Manchester City last month, they have lost three in a row now and their manager Mark Hughes badly needs a win. The Potters' biggest single problem is that they do not carry a goal threat. They have got some good players but I do not know where their goals are going to come from. Yes, they are changing the way they play, but they need results too. West Brom made a slower start to the season, but they have shown in their last two games against Manchester United and Arsenal what a good side they are. Steve Clarke's side are very strong going forward but that might actually help Stoke a little bit because the Baggies will be a bit more open. Lawro's prediction: 2-1 Reid's prediction: "We have to declare an interest here because we are dancing with Abbey Clancy, and her husband Peter Crouch plays for Stoke. If he plays on Saturday, I reckon he is going score and I think he is going to score late in a 1-1 draw." Clifton's prediction: "I really hope Peter plays and gets a win. It's a difficult one, though, because West Brom are playing and looking good - and I am going to have to go for a 1-0 Baggies win." All eyes will be on new Sunderland boss Gus Poyet in his first game in charge but Swansea need a result too - they have not won at home in the Premier League yet. I think Poyet will be looking for a performance from his players more than anything else. He will be looking at their attitude, concentration and commitment. That sort of thing is the bottom line because, if he gets that, then he has something to build on. If he can get a point or three points on Saturday too, then fantastic. The big game for Poyet is the following weekend, at home to Newcastle. In those games, anything can and will happen but what Poyet does not want to do is lose that one because, for Sunderland fans, those games are the biggest of their season. Sunderland have only got one point from their first seven games but Poyet has got time to turn things round. The biggest thing he has got to do is build a rapport in the dressing room because that was shot away under the Di Canio regime. He will have been doing that in training and also just in the way he talks to his players. What might help him out with every aspect of man-management is that he is following Di Canio - if one of the Teletubbies was following him, they would look all right. Lawro's prediction: 2-1 Reid's prediction: 3-0 Clifton's prediction: 2-0 Manchester City's away league form under Manuel Pellegrini has been poor so far, with only one point from three games, and I don't think he has quite come to terms with the demands of the Premier League. But if there is a place you can keep things tight it is at West Ham, because the pitch at Upton Park is not the biggest. That is one of the reasons I am leaning towards a draw here. West Ham's win over Tottenham last time out was a superb result. But what Hammers boss Sam Allardyce tends to do after a win like that is to try to not lose for the next few games. And it might sound daft for a team that won 3-0 at White Hart Lane, but West Ham are short of firepower. They are so short of strikers, they have re-signed Carlton Cole after releasing him in the summer. I can only guess that Frank McAvennie and Tony Cottee were not available. Lawro's prediction: 1-1 Reid's prediction: 0-1 Clifton's prediction: 0-1 I know Tottenham went to Villa Park and won 4-0 in the Capital One Cup in September, but this will be a completely different game. Christian Benteke will be back up front for Aston Villa after making a faster-than-expected recovery from his injury, and that will clearly be a big boost for them. Villa will have a point to prove after that defeat while we must wait and see whether Spurs have been unhinged a bit by their shock home defeat by West Ham. That was not only their worst result of the season so far but, within a few hours, Andre Villas-Boas saw all his players disappear to play international football. He will not have had much of a chance to work with them on what went wrong. Lawro's prediction: 1-1 Reid's prediction: 0-2 Clifton's prediction: 1-3 Fulham fans are still chasing Martin Jol despite his side's late win over Stoke in their last game. That was a big result for Jol and I still think he is a good manager. Hopefully his job is safe too. I read an interview with Cottagers owner Shahid Khan recently and I liked what he said. He owns the Jackonsville Jaguars NFL franchise in the US too, so he knows how unpredictable sport can be. I think he knows Jol is a good manager too. Khan did not appoint Jol, which is always a problem, but I am hopeful he will just leave him in there. Palace have lost four games in a row now, and I think Fulham will make it five. Eagles boss Ian Holloway is a good manager but his problem is that all of his players need to play well in order to get any sort of positive result. It seems like every week at the moment one section of their team is letting them down. That could happen to them in the Championship and they could get away with it - they might not concede. In the Premier League, you get punished. Lawro's prediction: 1-2 Reid's prediction: "Palace are on a run of four defeats but at home I think this is the moment we bounce back. I think it is going to be a tightly fought game and it is going to be 3-2 to Palace." Clifton's prediction: 1-0. Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan Make your own predictions to see how the Premier League will look after this weekend. </body>

      <body>Perched high on top of one of the giant new reactor buildings under construction at Taishan we had a view over the entire site. It's one of the biggest nuclear plants of its kind in the world: six reactors being built on the edge of the South China Sea. In front of us construction cranes encircled the egg-like shape of another huge, grey concrete reactor shell. They swung lazily back and forth. Teams of workers were welding metal bars in place. Everything looked incredibly orderly. George Osborne, the UK chancellor, looked impressed. Mr Osborne had just announced that he will welcome Chinese participation in building nuclear power stations in Britain. Mr Osborne's host, Zhang Shan Ming, the general manager of the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN), obviously keen to stress the safety features of the reactor, was explaining why the concrete casing was so thick. "It's against air traffic crash," Mr Zhang said. "Right," the UK chancellor replied. "Special safety procedures." "An earthquake, or tsunami, or typhoon, you are prepared for that?" Mr Osborne asked. "The design is prepared for this," he was told. Britain's chancellor seemed reassured, as he needs to be, given that a near replica of Taishan is now likely to be built at Hinkley Point in Somerset in the UK at a cost of around £14 billion ($22bn) by a similar consortium to that working in China. Taishan uses European-designed reactors built by a partnership between the French firm EDF and China's CGN. It's one of almost 30 new nuclear power plants China is building or planning to build. China has not had any major accidents at its nuclear power stations, and says its safety record is good. But there are concerns that, in the dash to build so many new reactors, and use indigenous Chinese technology in some, safety could be compromised. Just down the coast from Taishan lies Hong Kong, where environmental groups enjoy far more freedom than they would have in China. They say there are reasons the UK should be cautious about partnering with China's nuclear operators. "My first concern would be the lack of transparency," says Prentice Koo, senior campaigner at Greenpeace. "Their track record is really bad. For every incident in a nuclear power plant in China, they only provide a very brief report, and all it says is how they solved the problem," he says. "They never give the reason for the incident." His second concern is whether Chinese companies would actually pay up if they were found liable for any incident that happened to a reactor they had built overseas. "The nuclear industry in China enjoys such a privileged position that they have to pay only very limited sums in compensation if there is any major incident," explains Mr Koo. "Overseas they'll be required to pay a lot more... it'll test the ability of China's nuclear industry to pay up." At Taishan, though, they were keen to point out not only their safety features, but also how transparent they are. Dong Shi Ming, a public relations officer, said it was so open that members of the public could come and visit the site - all they had to do was apply for an organised tour. He claimed thousands had already done so. Is China's nuclear industry safe or not? Is it really transparent? They're important questions. Involvement in the UK will test China's firms. It may even force them to be more transparent. The only other place where China has built reactors so far is in Pakistan. Some in the West will be deeply uncomfortable at the prospect of Chinese state-owned firms being involved in the building and running of UK nuclear plants. After all, China remains an authoritarian state, its nuclear firms answerable, ultimately to the Communist Party. For now they are to be minority players in the UK. But one day they may have control over some of Britain's strategic energy supplies. Others, like George Osborne, see a great opportunity. As one member of the British delegation explained to me, deeper commercial engagement will give China a bigger stake in Britain's success. Britain's goodwill in opening up to Chinese firms could engender better ties and reciprocal opportunities for British firms in China's nuclear industry. The UK is already a major investor in China through oil firms like Shell and BP. Getting China to invest more in the UK makes the relationship more balanced, the argument goes. China now has stakes in Britain's oil and gas industries; nuclear opens a major new area to it. Some of this boils down to long-running arguments: Is it better to engage China or to be cautious? Is it wise to draw it into a deeper relationship with the outside world or be wary of the intentions of its opaque Communist rulers? At Taishan George Osborne has taken a big, some might worry risky, step: he's gone nuclear. </body>

      <title>When an operating theatre becomes a lab</title>
      <description>Why research is key to better surgery</description>

      <body>Scientific research takes place in a lab, doesn't it? Well, not when the developments are in surgery. Then it takes place in the clinics, wards and even the operating theatre. In this week's Scrubbing Up, Prof Dion Morton, director of research at the Royal College of Surgeons, says it is crucial that patients understand how important the work is - and that they take part. When people think about clinical trials their first thought might be of laboratories where pharmaceutical companies test the safety and effectiveness of drugs and vaccines. But in surgery too, clinical trials are a vitally important way of assessing the benefits new treatments bring to patients. Research and clinical trials are a daily part of the NHS, with many studies carried out by doctors and healthcare professionals who treat patients on a daily basis. Although 98% of people in the UK will need surgery at some point in their lives, less than 5% of government funding for medical research goes on improving surgery and developing new techniques. Surgery has been referred to as the 'Cinderella' of medical research, although funding has been slowly improving in recent years. From treating acute trauma to replacing joints after chronic disease, surgery has a broad impact and still cures more cancers than any other form of treatment. It is a vital part of the health service and investment in research is crucial if we are to be at the forefront of improving patient care. This is why new surgical clinical trial centres have been set up across the country. Surgeons are currently recruiting patients to assess new surgical techniques and determine which procedures give patients the best chance of making a full recovery. Each centre will focus on many different types of surgery including transplantation, heart and orthopaedic. Trials are challenging to design and it can be difficult to recruit patients, but with careful planning and good communication they are made possible. I am working on an international study which aims to find out at what point patients with late stage bowel cancer should be given chemotherapy. Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK and patients currently have to have surgery first to remove the cancer and then have chemotherapy. However, when the disease is advanced, all too often the cancer returns in the months or years that follow. This trial will look at whether patients who are given some chemotherapy prior to surgery are less likely to see their cancer return in the two years after treatment. In Bristol, colleagues are running a trial to compare the effectiveness of two common operations to treat severe obesity - gastric band and gastric bypass. During the course of the trial doctors will study over 700 patients, of which half will have been fitted with a gastric band and half will have had a bypass. Over three years they will compare how much weight patients' lose, whether they experience any complications following surgery and to what extent their quality of life improves following the operation. Obesity is a rapidly increasing global health problem which costs the NHS billions of pounds. Surgery is both a clinically-effective and cost-effective way of treating this disease and so the results of this trial will help the NHS decide which of these two treatments they should offer to patients. Surgical research has the potential to make real improvements in the way we care and treat patients. Patient safety and innovation go hand in hand as it is the evidence gained from these trials that will ultimately lead to reduced patient mortality and sickness. Despite limited investment, surgeons are striving to develop the evidence for new techniques and procedures that can change the face of hospital care. Raising standards, delivering new surgical treatments to patients and delivering them safely nationwide is central to a high quality health service. </body>

      <title>China's economic growth speeds up?</title>
      <description>Is China's economic growth as breakneck as figures suggest?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24577043</url>

      <body>China's economy sped up in the July-to-September quarter to expand at 7.8% year-on-year, according to official gross domestic product (GDP) figures. That's faster than the previous quarter when GDP grew at 7.5% and the January-to March quarter's 7.7% expansion. Unless the fourth quarter tanks, it means that the Chinese government will hit its growth target of 7.5% for the year, as the growth rate for the first nine months came in at 7.7%. If they were to hit the target, it would be the slowest growth rate since 1999 which was the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis. The Chinese government is aiming for a slower and better balanced economy that can grow more sustainably. But, one thing that hasn't changed is that there are more questions than ever over the reliability of Chinese figures. It's not just GDP, but the other data releases today have also come in largely as expected: industrial production rising 10.2% from a year earlier in September, retail sales up 13.3%, fixed asset investment grew by 20.2%. I've written about the trouble with Chinese figures before, particularly when it comes to GDP. But, how good are the three indicators reportedly espoused by China's premier Li Keqiang as being more reliable? They are gaining prominence as they are being used by banks such as Credit Suisse and JPMorgan as an alternative index for Chinese growth. The first indicator is electricity usage. The amount of power used by households and firms is a good gauge of consumption and one that is hard to hide. One problem is that China subsidizes some prices so it's somewhat mis-measured, but it's a decent economic indicator. Credit Suisse estimates it's around 9% annualised growth. The amount of cargo freight is the second measure. Instead of factories saying how much they've produced (recall that they have been chastised for faking figures in Yunnan and Guangdong provinces this year), it's more reliable to take a look ourselves. Railway cargo volume shows how much has been manufactured and is being moved around the country. But it is an under-measurement of economic activity because it only captures around 40% of GDP - the biggest part of the Chinese economy now is services. Cargo freight volumes are growing at around 21%. The final gauge is bank loans. How much households and firms borrow over the medium and long-term reflects the amount of demand in the economy for investment. This is why it's a good indicator of economic activity. But if this is used unproductively to build ghost cities, then it's a different way of over-stating growth. These loans are growing at about 5%. It's not just Western banks that look at this data. I understand from Chinese government researchers that a rule of thumb is if the Li Keqiang indicators show about 10-11% growth, then real GDP growth would be around 7-8%. In which case, today's GDP figure would be consistent with the Li Keqiang index and show that the Chinese economy is speeding up. But, there are others who are convinced that Chinese officials won't miss (bar an external crisis that can be blamed) a growth target, so none of these government-produced figures are very reliable. Plus, none of these indicators, even viewed together, would be able to give a complete picture. One thing is clear is that this debate is sure to run and run. For the Chinese leadership who are keen to show that they're cracking down on fraudulent data and increasing confidence in the economy, it would help if they could indicate why they are well-equipped to produce GDP figures faster than any other major economy in the world. Doing so in just over 2 weeks is a fairly remarkable feat for any country, much less one with 1.3 billion people. That's a lot of data to process in a rather short period of time. </body>

      <title>National teacher strike may go ahead</title>
      <description>Teaching unions say they will press ahead with plans for a one-day national strike before Christmas if the dispute is not resolved.</description>

      <body>Teaching unions say they will press ahead with a one-day national strike before Christmas if a dispute over pay, pensions and jobs is not resolved. Nearly 3,500 schools were closed or partially closed on Thursday in London, Cumbria, and the South East, North East and South West of England. This was the third in a rolling campaign of regional walk-outs. A national strike would include Wales, as teachers' pay and conditions are determined by Westminster. Teachers are angry about the introduction of performance related pay and changes which mean they will have to work until they are at least 65 to be eligible for a full pension, rising to 68 for those born after 1978, say the unions. They also complain of excessive workloads, changes to their working conditions and job cuts. Teachers in the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber region walked out on 1 October. This followed a strike across the North West on 27 June. So far Wales has not been affected by the strikes. Teachers in Northern Ireland and Scotland deal with their devolved governments on pay and conditions and so will remain unaffected by this dispute. The NASUWT says it is considering its next steps but it is likely that the planned one-day national strike will go ahead if the government does not address its concerns. The union's general secretary Chris Keates said: "The rolling programme of strike action has commanded support from the overwhelming majority of teachers. "The Secretary of State can no longer claim that the majority of teachers support his reforms. Teachers' anger and frustration is much in evidence and he now needs to begin to seriously address their concerns. "The NASUWT National Action Committee is keeping matters under review." The government restated its disappointment that the unions were striking over measures to allow head teachers to pay good teachers more. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said only around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed on Thursday, compared with 60% who walked out in the national strikes of November 2011. The government says that it has met the unions frequently to discuss their concerns and will continue to do so. </body>

      <title>Protesters disrupt French schools</title>
      <description>Secondary schools in Paris and other French cities are again disrupted by pupils protesting at the removal of two foreign students from France.</description>

      <body>Schools in Paris and other French cities are being disrupted again by pupil protests over the removal of two foreign students from France. Protesters gathered on the French capital's Bastille square, traditional meeting-place of the left, as some demonstrators clashed with riot police. Divisions have appeared among the ruling Socialists over the affair. It has emerged that the father of a Roma schoolgirl at the centre of the row lied over his asylum claim. However, the anger in France has focused on the way Leonarda Dibrani, 15, was removed from a school bus to be expelled along with her family earlier this month. They had been living in the eastern region of Doubs for several years. While President Francois Hollande has remained silent, his partner, Valerie Trierweiler, spoke out on Friday to question the girl's treatment. Protesters are calling for the resignation of Interior Minister Manuel Valls, who has defended the authorities' tough line and takes a tough policy towards Roma immigrants in general. The minister has cut short an official visit to the French Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe in order to return to Paris, where findings of an inquiry into the handling of the affair are expected to be ready shortly. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault has said the family will be allowed to return if "any fault is found" with the expulsion order. There is also anger over the removal of Khatchik Kachatryan, a 19-year-old student in Paris who was expelled on Saturday to Armenia after reportedly being arrested for shoplifting, at which point police discovered he had entered France illegally. Police fired tear gas at some protesters in Paris but the demonstration in the Nation-Bastille area appeared to be passing off peacefully in the main. Pupils partially blocked entry to as many as 20 secondary schools in Paris while allowing other pupils to enter to attend classes, the pupils' union Fidl said. Outside one school in central Paris, the Lycee Charlemagne, wheelie bins were used to block the entrance. A banner read "Jotters not [ID] papers". One protester at the school, named as David, told Reuters: "We're a bit lost, we say our country is the country of human rights, a country which welcomes people and we still deport a 15-year-old girl and a 19-year-old student to a country... that they don't know and where they have no future." There appeared to be less protest activity in other French cities but some schools were affected in Marseille, Lyon and Rouen. Speaking on a visit to Angers, Ms Trierweiler said "certain boundaries cannot be crossed" and "the school gate is one of them". Education Minister Vincent Peillon told French radio that it was wrong for the authorities to have detained the girl while she was on a trip. "What is certain is that when one is in the setting of a class outing, and that was the case, you are part of school life... and you can't intervene during that time," he said. "That means schools are kind of a sanctuary." Opinion polls suggest Mr Valls is the most popular member of President Hollande's government with the wider public. His critics point to the fact that he himself was born in Spain. However, he was naturalised in France more than 20 years ago. Leonarda Dibrani and her family have been given a flat and a small allowance in the Kosovo city of Mitrovica, where they have been speaking to French journalists about the shock of being sent to a region where they are strangers, unable to speak Albanian. Resat Dibrani told media in Kosovo, where he and his family were expelled, that he had lied to the French authorities when he said his family was from the breakaway Serbian region. In fact, only he was born there while, according to him, his daughter Leonarda and other members of his family were born in Italy. "We lied to the authorities when we said we were from Kosovo," he told Reuters news agency. It emerged in France that the father was investigated by French authorities for allegedly beating his family. Little is known about the fate of Mr Kachatryan, though it was reported that he had been detained on his return to Armenia for evading military service. </body>

      <body>More than 60 parents had asked Derby City Council about moving their children out of the Al-Madinah free school before a damning Ofsted report was released, the BBC has learned. The figures pre-date the report, which said the school was failing in all areas and was "dysfunctional". Enquiries were made by 67 parents, with 33 making formal applications to put their children elsewhere. The school said it accepted the findings and would use them to move on. On Thursday, Dr Stuart Wilson, the acting head teacher, said there were serious problems at the school and accepted some of the lessons were not meeting necessary standards. The Ofsted report said teachers at Al-Madinah were inexperienced and had not been provided with proper training and that the school required special measures. Parent Razwana Bibiakbar said she would not be taking her child out of the school but added that it had let the pupils down. She said: "Something has to be done [like bringing] new leadership, new team, new staff - qualified - into Al-Madinah school to run it properly. "Why should I pull my daughter out of that school? Why can't they pull their socks up and fix everything?" The Ofsted inspection had been due to take place by the end of the year but was prioritised following initial allegations that female teachers were obliged to wear hijabs and boys and girls were segregated. David Cameron told BBC Radio Derby on Thursday that the Al-Madinah situation should not be used as a stick with which to beat the whole free school movement. </body>

      <title>'Boost family learning in schools'</title>
      <description>Millions of children are being held back by their parents' poor educational attainment, suggests a report.</description>

      <body>Millions of children in England and Wales are held back by their parents' poor basic skills, suggests a report. Involving the whole family in learning can boost educational attainment across generations and should be integral to schools says the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education (NIACE). Governments should give family learning more support, the report says. England is "a nation in crisis" as far as skills are concerned said inquiry chairwoman Baroness Howarth. "Adults whose parents have low levels of education are eight times more likely to have poor proficiency in literacy than adults whose parents had higher levels of education," writes Valerie Howarth in her foreword. "Surely it is a moral outrage that a nation such as ours should be in this position." The report draws on a recent OECD study which found that adults in England score among the lowest results in international literacy and numeracy tests when compared with the same age group in other industrialised countries. The OECD study, published earlier in October, found England was 22nd for literacy and 21st for numeracy out of 24 countries. The NIACE team also looked at research from national and local government, Ofsted and from educational, family and children's charities. They found "particularly compelling evidence that family language and maths programmes benefit children's skills as well as those of their parents and carers". They also found evidence of wider benefits from improving adults' confidence and self-esteem to reducing ill health, unemployment and re-offending. NIACE urges head teachers to fund family learning through the Pupil Premium which is paid to schools to support the attainment of pupils on free school meals or in care. It also calls for government departments to work together to support family learning and to ensure that there is enough funding to meet demand. David Hughes, chief executive of NIACE said: "Imagine growing up in a home where there are no books, no stories and where your parents don't have the confidence to help you with your homework. "Unfortunately that is a reality for too many children - but this situation can be overcome. "Across the country there are examples of family learning programmes which have transformed the prospects of adults and children. "But these programmes should not be the exception, they need to be the norm in every school and community." A spokeswoman for the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills said the government already supported adults to improve English and maths skills, whether or not they were in work, fully funding GCSE and other qualifications. "We support a wide range of provision so that adults can participate in learning in the way that suits them, including community learning, traditional college courses and online learning." The government also supports family learning through the £210m community learning budget to fund a range of flexible courses, including English and maths tailored to individuals' needs and learning styles, said the spokeswoman. Brian Lightman of the Association of School and College Leaders said he broadly welcomed the report. "Parents play a hugely important role in their children's success at school, and schools already do a great deal to engage parents and help them to support their children. "There are a lot of examples of good practice already in schools around the country to draw on. "It is a two-way street however, and while schools can offer opportunities parents have to be willing to engage in them. "Sadly some parents can't or won't support their children's learning and in those cases it is incredibly challenging for schools to create family learning links." </body>

      <title>More universities look beyond grades</title>
      <description>More UK universities are using extra and personal information - not just grades - to decide which students get places, a report suggests.</description>

      <body>More UK universities are using personal and extra information - not just grades - to decide which students get places, a report suggests. Of the 67 institutions who replied to a survey, 37% said they used such "contextual data" - and most of the remaining ones planned to do so. UK universities are encouraged to use such data to recruit more students from poor homes. University leaders are calling for an informed public debate on the issue. In England, permission to charge tuition fees higher than £6,000 a year is on condition that universities work to attract and recruit more poorer students. Less formal arrangements, also encouraging this move towards "widening participation", are in place in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Research carried out by a publicly funded but independent body called Spa (Supporting Professionalism in Admissions) looked at what kind of extra information universities were using when making offers to students or deciding whom to admit. It says a survey it carried out of UK universities in November last year found that 37% of those who responded (67 in total) used contextual data and 57% planned to do so. Extra information used (beyond grades and predicted grades) includes personal details put on an application, information about applicants' school or college, the kind of area they live in and whether they have taken part in activities designed to "raise aspirations". Such data is used mostly, Spa found, in considering whether to admit "borderline" pupils at the point when places are confirmed. After that, it is used in clearing - the process run in August to match students to places - to decide whom to offer places to, to interview and to admit. Finally, the researchers say such information is used to consider "whether or not to make a differential offer" - that is, when deciding to make someone an offer at lower grades than is usual because of the potential they show. Contextual data has been used for "many years", according to Spa, but is now "playing an increasing role in strengthening fair admissions and access at all stages of the admissions process". It says more research is needed - as well as more transparency from institutions about their admissions systems. The study says more universities are moving towards a centralised system for admissions, away from individual departments controlling this. Professor Janet Beer, chair of the Spa steering group and vice-chancellor of Oxford Brookes University, said: "Spa's report brings together, for the first time, the evidence base for using contextualised admissions in the UK higher education sector. "It shows us that this information has an important role to play in ensuring fair access for applicants as well as helping to sustain academic excellence by admitting those who demonstrate the strongest potential to thrive in higher education." Professor Beer added that there was a "growing appetite" among universities for using contextual data, not least because of the more competitive market. Paul Clark, from Universities UK, which represents university leaders, said universities were "driven by the desire to maintain excellence by recruiting the best students for their courses and identifying candidates with the most potential to succeed". "This report shows that increasing numbers of universities are looking to use contextual data to do this," he said. "University can be a life-changing experience. Contextual data is one way of ensuring that anyone with the ability and desire to go to university has the opportunity to do so. "As the report concludes, it is also important that universities are open about their use of contextual data and information. There is a need to have an informed public debate about the merits of using this additional data in the university admissions process." There has been some criticism of the use of such data and accusations that this amounts to "social engineering". Private school heads say they support the "sensible and sensitive" use of such information - as long as it is used fairly. Chris Ramsey, from the HMC which represents leading independent schools and head master of the King's School in Chester, said contextual data was an important part of the admissions process - and his school used it too. "We are not opposed to its use - as long as it is personal to each student, sensitively and sensibly used, and as long as it is not simply blanket bias for or against certain student types - for example, bias for or against students who went to a particular type of school," he said. "Each student deserves to be treated as an individual, not as part of a politically-determined group. "A student who has been, for example, educated at a low-performing school for only part of his or her career, or who is state-educated but from a socially privileged background, should not be advantaged over one who has worked hard or been given a bursary at an independent school." </body>

      <body>Thousands of schools were closed across much of England as teachers went out on strike over pay, pensions and jobs. Teachers in London, Cumbria, the South East, North East and South West have been taking part with nearly 3,500 schools shut or partially closed. The action was part of a continuing campaign of regional strikes involving members of the NUT and NASUWT unions. Prime Minister David Cameron said the strike was "inconvenient for parents" and "not good for pupils' education". NUT general secretary Christine Blower, said the union regretted the disruption caused to pupils and parents but teachers felt they had "no other choice". Major rallies have been taking place in Bristol, Durham and London, with smaller events in other areas, including Brighton, Carlisle and Plymouth. Teachers are objecting to proposals by Education Secretary Michael Gove to bring in performance-related pay, increase their workloads and make changes to their pensions. Twenty out of 33 London boroughs provided information to BBC London 94.9 about the number of schools affected. Of those, about 445 schools were completely closed and 450 partially closed. And in Tyne and Wear, at least 471 schools were affected by the industrial action. Head teacher Roberta Kirby, from Fernhurst Junior School, in Portsmouth, said the government had "declared war" on teachers. More than 200 schools in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight were affected by the action. She said: "If we cannot offer good wages and a pension that staff pay into that reflects the work they do, then we are not going to be able to attract the best graduates." Responding to the impact of the strike, some parents said they had found it difficult to find alternative childcare. The BBC's Sarah Ransome said: "People in Plymouth have been telling me that finding alternative childcare because of the strike has been 'quite a headache'." A similar walkout by teachers took place in the east of England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber region on 1 October. Ms Blower said: "Mr Gove has done nothing to address the crisis of low morale in the teaching profession which threatens the continued provision of high quality education." Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said the "overwhelming majority of teachers" were on strike. She said: "Teachers are committed and dedicated public service workers. They do not take strike action lightly. "No teacher has any wish to inconvenience parents or disrupt pupils' education, but this action is not the failure or due to the unreasonableness, of teachers." Plans for a national one-day walkout before Christmas have also been announced by the two unions. Speaking to BBC Sussex, Mr Cameron said responsibility for the strike "lies with the teaching unions". "I think it is very disappointing they have decided to go on strike," he said. "And when we look at the things they are striking over, pensions and pay, they are things that have been decided independently by well-led reviews. "I was at my children's school today in London. One class was not there but the rest of the school was operating. "So, every praise to those teachers who have gone ahead and kept our schools open for our kids." A spokeswoman for the Department for Education (DfE) said 27% of the schools in the affected regions were closed. However, there was no figure available for how many were partially closed. She said: "The NUT and NASUWT have tried to create as much disruption for pupils and parents today as possible. "In spite of this, thanks to many hardworking teachers and heads, only around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed today." </body>

      <title>Muslim free school 'dysfunctional'</title>
      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby is criticised by Ofsted inspectors as "dysfunctional" and rated inadequate in every category.</description>

      <body>A Muslim free school has been described by Ofsted inspectors as "dysfunctional" and rated inadequate in every category - within a year of it opening. An inspection at Derby's Al-Madinah school was brought forward after fears were raised over teaching standards. The report says teachers there are inexperienced and have not been provided with proper training and that the school requires special measures. The school said it accepted the report and would use it to move forward. Reacting to the findings, David Cameron told BBC Radio Derby: "If they don't take immediate action to deal with these things then I think it is right it should close and I think it's absolutely right to intervene rapidly when these things aren't working properly." However, he added: "Let's not use this as a stick with which to beat the whole free school movement - there are now hundreds of schools which have set up as free schools, and on average they have more outstanding and good ratings than established schools. "When it goes wrong - just as with a state school - you've got to get in there and sort it out, or close it down," he said. The Ofsted inspection had been due to take place by the end of the year but was prioritised following initial allegations that female teachers were obliged to wear hijabs and boys and girls were segregated. The school has since written to pupils and staff telling them there is no requirement to cover their hair. Education minister Lord Nash last week warned the school it faced closure unless discrimination against female staff and pupils stopped. A spokesperson said: "We were already investigating this school before allegations became public. We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection. "We have received a response from the Al-Madinah Education Trust as well as a report on the school from Ofsted. Any decisions made will take into account all the available evidence." The Ofsted report found that pupils were given the same work "regardless of their different abilities" and the governing body was "ineffective". It said basic systems were not in place, describing the school as being "in chaos" and "dysfunctional". Boys and girls had different lunch sittings but the report said this was due to the small size of the canteen. Inspectors gave the school the lowest ranking - "inadequate" - in every area, prompting the chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw to call for it to be placed in special measures. This means Ofsted will carry out inspections at the school at short notice to monitor improvements. If poor performance continues the school could be closed. Dr Stuart Wilson, the acting head teacher, said there were "significant and serous problems" at the school and accepted some of the lessons were not meeting necessary standards. "Are special measures a disaster for the school? Yes, they are," said Dr Wilson. "It's not where we want the school to be at this time but we accept the report." In one mathematics lesson, described by Ofsted as "insufficiently challenging", pupils spent the majority of their time cutting out and pasting shapes. Dr Wilson said the school, which has 412 pupils aged between four and 16, had a lot of issues to deal with but he insisted it did have a future. "Obviously the report doesn't make pleasant reading for anybody - we don't want to be in this position - we wish we weren't in this position - but what we need to do now is to accept the report in full and use it to move the school forward." Writing to the school's chair of governors on Thursday, Lord Nash said the Ofsted report was "further compelling evidence of the breaches of the funding agreement I have required you to address". "Contrary to your suggestion that I have acted prematurely, I am even more convinced of the need for very decisive and urgent action on the part of the trust to comply with all your obligations and remedy the serious failings at the school." One parent told the BBC: "I know they are teaching my children well. I'm seeing their progress and I have no concerns at all about the school." Another, Razwana Akbar, said: "I am very angry. They have broken the trust as professional teachers, they have let us down." Chris Williamson, MP for Derby North, said: "Frankly, the position of Al-Madinah school is now untenable and I would fully expect the school to close and for the children to be found alternative places in the council schools in the city." Speaking in Parliament earlier, shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said the Ofsted report was a "devastating blow to the education secretary's flagship policy". He said: "It reveals that pupils have been failed on every possible measure and parents will want to know why the education secretary has allowed this to happen." He described the government's free school programme as a "dangerous free-for-all". "David Cameron and Michael Gove can no longer ignore this issue - it is a crisis entirely of their own making," he said. But speaking at the weekend, Mr Hunt told BBC One's Andrew Marr programme that although Labour would not open new free schools "along the Michael Gove model", the bulk of existing free schools would be kept open as his party wanted to "keep the good free schools". Responding to Mr Hunt's more recent comments, the schools minister David Laws said that the government had taken "swift action" to deal with failings at the Al-Madinah free school told MPs that no school would be allowed to "languish in failure". He also accused Labour of "total and utter opportunism" using the report "to shift its position". </body>

      <description>Children as young as 10 have been taught about domestic violence in a pilot scheme which could now be rolled out across Wales.</description>

      <body>Children as young as 10 have been taught about domestic violence in a pilot scheme which could now be rolled out across Wales. Two Carmarthenshire primary schools took part in the six week pilot aimed at recognising danger signs in relationships. Hafan Cymru's project had only been used in secondary schools before. The charity said it was so successful the aim was to use it right across Wales. In the pilot, six sessions for 10 and 11 year olds were delivered in the two participating schools and one for parents and training for staff. Gaynor Jones, schools resource officer for Hafan Cymru, said it was the first scheme in Wales they knew of that has been delivered to children across Years 5 and 6. "They've [the pupils] been absolutely brilliant, they've been really open, they've learnt a lot of new ideas," she added. "They've learnt a lot of new vocabulary and I think it's really important that we get that vocabulary out into the public domain. "We're hearing they're discussing it with parents at home as well and that's great, we want those messages to be carried home." Last year a third of Hafan Cymru's service users were aged 16-24, and the organisation feels that preventative work in schools is key to ending domestic abuse in communities. But Ms Jones admits funding is the issue that could prevent the scheme being rolled out wider. And she is hoping that the Welsh government's White Paper about ending violence against women becomes law and will be followed up with funding which is "absolutely vital". "We know that teenagers are getting into abusive relationships younger and younger now," Ms Jones added. "We're developing a peer education project with our service users in Hafan Cymru and one of those women we're working in entered her first abusive relationship when she was 13. "So by the time children are in secondary school, it's not too late. We can still save some hopefully. "But if we can get the message out younger, that's great." Catrin Nicholas, assistant head teacher at Ysgol Llech y Fedach in Tumble, said she had initial concerns about how such a difficult subject could be dealt with but she said the content had been aimed properly at young children. "Once the initial session was over I realised it was going to be all right because it focused on good relationships with others. "It focused on the positive points of that rather than anything too scary or too frightening for pupils who are so young," she said. </body>

      <title>Bright poor 'held back for decades'</title>
      <description>The qualifications of adults now in their 40s, 50s and 60s were as much influenced by social background as intelligence, a long-term study finds.</description>

      <body>The level of qualifications achieved by adults now in their 40s, 50s and 60s was influenced by social background as much as their own intelligence, according to a long-term study from the University of Oxford. It found that children of the same ability went on to achieve very different levels of exam results. Academics tracked 5,000 people in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It comes as a report on social mobility is about be published. The study, from Oxford University's Department of Social Policy and Intervention, examined the academic achievements of cohorts of people born between the late 1940s and 1970. Their academic results as young adults were compared with cognitive ability tests taken when they were aged between 10 and 13. It showed that children from wealthier and better educated families had been much more successful in exam results than poorer children of a similar intelligence level. It meant that many poor, bright young people leaving school in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s failed to reach their full potential. Among the youngest of this survey, leaving school in the mid-1980s, fewer than one in five went to university. Among the oldest group, who would have left school in the early 1970s, only about one in 20 reached degree level. Last week figures from the OECD think tank indicated the 55-65 age group in England had stronger literacy and numeracy skills than 16-24-year-olds, even though the younger group had much better qualifications. The OECD has warned about the diminishing job prospects for those without skills. And this study shows the long roots of the academic gap between rich and poor and the lack of social mobility in education. What surprised the Oxford University researchers was that a parallel study in Sweden, across the same decades, also showed a strong link between economic background and academic achievement. The lead author of the study, Erzsebet Bukodi, said there were expectations that Sweden would have had more equal outcomes, but the results showed that poorer children were also disadvantaged there. Co-author, Prof John Goldthorpe, said the results showed that Sweden was not "significantly ahead" in terms of a meritocratic system and he said it raised questions about whether educational policies could be used to promote social mobility. Dr Bukodi also highlighted how the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s were decades of great social change, with a perception of increased social mobility, but the studies in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland and Sweden showed a sustained picture of a social gap in exam results. Across three decades there had been no diminishing of this link between social background and achievement, said Dr Bukodi. Despite the lack of a level playing field, it still remained possible for bright children from poorer backgrounds to out-perform those who were from wealthier backgrounds, but with less intelligence. But it was an uphill struggle. The study suggests that among the cleverest children born in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland in 1970, in the top fifth of the ability range, 80% of the richest children achieved two A-levels or their equivalent, compared with only 40% for the poorest. It meant that for poor children with high levels of intelligence, a majority left school in the 1980s without two A-levels. "We see that in both the British and Swedish educational systems, even the very brightest children are hampered if they come from a disadvantaged background," said Dr Bukodi. "It is possible of course that clever individuals choose other ways of getting on in the world than through education, but the fact remains that many children in British and Swedish schools do not appear to fulfil their academic potential." </body>

      <title>Apprentice schemes 'need reform'</title>
      <description>Apprenticeships in England need to be overhauled to stop many young people being offered practical qualifications that have little worth, a study says.</description>

      <body>Apprenticeships in England need to be overhauled to stop many young people being awarded practical qualifications that have little worth, a report says. Compared with other European countries, many apprenticeships are low quality and too short, the Sutton Trust warns. It says thousands of apprenticeships should be created to boost the economy and improve youngsters' job prospects. The Department for Education says apprenticeships are being reformed to "drive up standards". The Association of Colleges said some existing apprenticeships were respected by industry and should be preserved. The study, which was carried out by the Boston Consulting Group on behalf of the Sutton Trust, says fewer than 200,000 of the 520,000 apprenticeships starting in England every year are rated at level three - which is equivalent to A-level. The report cites figures that suggest apprenticeships are offered by just one in five (20%) of employers in England, compared with over half (51%) in Germany, which, the report says, is considered to have one of the best vocational education systems. Only 61,000 new apprenticeship starts were for young people, whereas in Germany, 570,000 new apprenticeships are for youngsters and 90% of these are equivalent to A-levels. The report also notes that England's vocational system has 18,000 different qualifications, while Germany has 330. The report warns that since 2010, more than half (58%) of apprenticeships have been below level three and three-quarters have been aimed at those over the age of 25, many of whom are already in work. And it warns 11 young people are competing for each apprenticeship. In his foreword to the report, Sutton Trust chairman Sir Peter Lampl said the report had found that, with some exceptions, the opportunities on offer to young people who did not go to university were "poor". The attitude in England, with some exceptions, was very different to that in countries such as Germany and Switzerland, he said. "Instead of a clear system of respected vocational routes, we suffer from a complicated patchwork where too many young people are offered qualifications of little worth in a system that confuses employers and is not valued as it should be by society," he said. He said the "cruel deception" about an expansion in apprenticeships, when many were below level three and the majority went to older workers, had to stop. The report calls for apprenticeships to be radically expanded, with up to 300,000 new starts each year. The majority of these should be at level three at least for three years, with some four-year courses at level four - higher than A-levels. No more than 10% of apprenticeships should be two-year courses at level two, it says. Sir Peter said: "Real apprenticeships are as important to social mobility as good university degrees. "Students facing huge loans for a university education find themselves between a rock and a hard place. Even if they would prefer to work with training, the lack of good apprenticeships means they feel they have little choice. "England's patchwork vocational system not only hinders our economic competitiveness, it prevents tens of thousands of young people from gaining good skilled jobs." Teresa Frith, from the Association of Colleges, said: "Creating 300,000 apprenticeships, when the report acknowledges there is already a shortage of apprenticeship places for 16 to-year-olds, would be a massive challenge and although we agree that there is a business case for employers to take on apprentices, at the moment too few do. "The report also says level three apprenticeships should be the priority. This isn't a bad idea in principle but some level two apprenticeships, such as those in construction, are well-respected by the industry and should be preserved. "The report is absolutely right to say that vocational courses should only be taught in institutions with high-quality facilities and expert teaching staff and that careers advice and guidance needs to be improved." A Department for Education spokeswoman said: "We are already radically reforming apprenticeships to drive up standards so that they are more rigorous and responsive to the needs of employers. "Since 2010 over a million people have become apprentices, providing a great start to their careers. We have already insisted that apprenticeships last for a minimum of a year, include more English and maths and that every apprenticeship is a job. "We have consulted on wider reforms to drive up standards in apprenticeships further, and will publish plans later this month." </body>

      <description>Working parents in Britain no longer earn enough to "escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn warns in his first report.</description>

      <body>Working parents in Britain "simply do not earn enough to escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn has warned. Two-thirds of poor children are now from families where an adult works, his report found. Many low and middle-income children face being "worse off" than their parents because of falling earnings and rising prices, Mr Milburn added. Wealthier pensioners' benefits should be cut and minimum pay raised, he said. The former Labour health secretary suggested some benefits currently protected from cuts - such as free TV licences and winter fuel allowances for pensioners - could be means tested in order to share the burden of austerity more fairly. But a spokesman for David Cameron said: "The prime minister believes it is right to make commitments to pensioners in relationship to state provision." The government has pledged to safeguard such benefits until the next general election. In its first report, the government's Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission warned the target of ending child poverty by 2020 would "in all likelihood be missed by a considerable margin" - leaving as many as two million children in poverty. Poverty is defined as having a household income that is less than 60% of the national median income. The latest government figures on poverty, released in June, show the median UK household income for 2011/2012 was £427 a week - 60% of that figure was £256 a week. In that year, 17% of children, or 2.3 million, were classed as being in poverty while 15% of working-age adults, or 5.6 million, were in poverty. For pensioners, meanwhile, that figures was 16% - or 1.9 million. The report said Britain still had "high levels of child poverty and low levels of social mobility" with a rising number of children in "absolute poverty" coming from working families. Two thirds of children officially deemed as being poor now came from a family where at least one parent was working - and in three out of four of those cases, at least one of their parents was working full time, the report found. It also said the "twin problems of high youth unemployment and falling living standards" were storing up problems for the future. Among its key recommendations the report urged the government to: "Just as the UK government has focused on reducing the country's financial deficit it now needs to redouble its efforts to reduce our country's fairness deficit," the report said. Single mother Judith Healy, who works from home as a telemarketer, said that, while her wages had not gone up, her expenses had continued to increase. She said she was worried about paying energy bills this winter. "We didn't ask to get in this situation, we are doing the best that we can in the circumstances that we have and that's really what it's about - it's survival now," she told BBC News. Mr Milburn told the BBC: "Today child poverty is a problem for working families rather than the workless or the work-shy." Around five million people in the country, mainly women, were earning less than the living wage, which is about £7.45 an hour outside of London, he said. "These are the people frankly who do all the right things, they go out to work, they stand on their own two feet, they look after their families - they're the strivers not the shirkers - and yet they're all too often the forgotten people of Britain and I think they desperately need a new deal." Mr Milburn said that while ministers and employers could do more, it was unrealistic to expect the government to continue topping up low pay using working tax credits. He advocated a scheme for pairing bright children with the best teachers in an effort to raise attainment. Mr Milburn has previously said social mobility - the idea that individuals can better themselves in terms of educational opportunity, job prospects and salaries from one generation to the next - is "flat-lining". Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg welcomed the report, but warned that "punishing pensioners isn't going to help a single child achieve more in life". Enver Solomon, of the National Children's Bureau charity, said the report was "a wake-up call for all political parties by stating that our country is dramatically polarised between the haves and have- nots". "As the commission states, there is an urgent need to rebalance the distribution of resources so that the burden of austerity is more equally shared," he said. Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said the "powerful report" showed "ordinary families' living standards [were being] squeezed and social divisions [were] deepening as a result of this government's decisions to put a privileged few first". On Wednesday, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed the number of unemployed people in the UK fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million in the June-August period. </body>

      <body>University staff are to stage a one-day national strike at the end of this month in a row over pay. Institutions across the UK are expected to be affected by the action, taken by three unions - the University and College Union (UCU), Unison and Unite. The Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), which represents universities as employers, said it was disappointed by the move. The news comes as teachers plan a strike in parts of England on Thursday. Members of the National Union of Teachers and the NASUWT are staging a further regional strike in their continuing row over pay, pensions and workload. The unions planning the university strike for 31 October claim a 1% pay rise offered to staff - including lecturers, technicians and administration workers - means there has been a 13% pay cut in real terms since October 2008. For Unite, the turnout for the ballot was 28% and of these, 64% (1,654 members) voted in favour of action. For the UCU the turnout was 35%, with 62% voting in favour of strike action. Unison declined to release details of what percentage of its membership had voted. It only said of those who had voted, 54.4% had been in favour of action and 45.6% against. UCU head of higher education Michael MacNeil said: "Staff have suffered year-on-year cuts in the value of their pay. Quite simply, enough is enough. "We urge the employers to reflect on the fact that they are about to face their first ever strike by three unions at the same time and come to the negotiating table to resolve this dispute. "The suppression of academic pay is one of the most sustained pay cuts since World War II and, while strike action is always a last resort, the fact that staff are prepared to take this step demonstrates just how angry they are." A spokesman for UCEA said: "Employers do understand that the general 1% uplift offered to all may be frustrating to these trade unions, with 5% of the workforce saying they will support strike action. "However, we also know that much more than this is going into pay increases for HEI [higher education institution] staff: 3% incremental rises for many plus merit payments beyond this. "Our HEIs tell us that the vast majority of their staff understand the reality of the current environment and would not want to take action that could harm their institutions and their students." </body>

      <title>Teenagers face 'sexting' pressure</title>
      <description>A surveyl suggests almost two thirds of teenagers have been asked for sexual images or videos of themselves, BBC Newsnight learns.</description>

      <body>Six out of 10 teenagers say they have been asked for sexual images or videos, an NSPCC/ChildLine survey seen by the BBC's Newsnight programme suggests. Of those questioned, 40% said they had created a sexual image or video, and about a quarter said they had sent one to someone else by text. The NSPCC's head, Peter Wanless, said "sexting" was getting much more common. "These results show that sexting is increasingly a feature of adolescent relationships," he told Newsnight. "It is almost becoming the norm that a young person in a relationship should share an explicit image of themselves," he said. For the survey, NSPCC and ChildLine spoke to 450 teenagers from across the country. Of those who had sent an image or video to someone else by text, 58% said the image had been sent to a boyfriend or girlfriend, but a third said they had sent it to someone they knew online but had never met. About 15% said they had sent the material to a stranger. Of those who said they had sent a photo to someone, 20% said it had then been shared with other people, while 28% said they did not know if their picture had been shared with anyone else. More than half (53%) of those questioned said they had received a sexual photo or video, a third of whom had received it from a stranger. Under British law it is legal to have sex aged 16, but it is illegal and a serious criminal offence to take, hold or share "indecent" photos of anyone aged under 18. However, the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) told Newsnight it was highly unlikely children would be prosecuted for sexting. "I've been sent a picture before, when I was at school," Daniel, 19, told Newsnight. Speaking from the Salmon Youth Centre in Bermondsey, south-east London, he said: "This girl [and me] had an argument the next day - not about the picture but about something else. "I got so angry, I was sending that picture everywhere. It was mean. I felt bad after. To this day she hates me, but that's not the point. I shouldn't have done it in the first place." Taylor Weekes, 17, told Newsnight: "Most girls of my generation do it for attention, to try and find love out of it, but it usually is the wrong way." According to figures from the National Crime Agency's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop) command, 62% of children aged 12-15 owned a mobile phone in 2012, with the figure expected to rise by the end of 2013. Experts say growing smartphone ownership, together with evolving technology, has helped created a perfect storm. Even many of the cheapest mobiles now have cameras with which teenagers can easily take pictures of themselves and distribute them cheaply. With most phones now connected to the internet, "sexts" can instantly be posted on social networking sites - quickly accessible by millions of people. Ceop is dedicated to eradicating the sexual abuse of children. It says it is concerned about images falling into the wrong hands. "What we're seeing is abusers taking advantage and getting images out of young people and then blackmailing them for more by saying, 'If you don't do more for me, I'll send these to your family and friends,'" Ceop's head of education, Jonathan Baggaley, said. Now there are growing calls for the government to do more to educate young people about the potential dangers of creating and posting self-generated sexual content. Ministers say that from 2014 all children in England from the age of five will be taught how to stay safe online as part of the new IT curriculum, while existing guidelines offer a sound framework for sex and relationship education in school. But campaigners say the dangers of sexting should be covered in personal, social, and health education (PSHE) lessons. "Sexting is not an IT issue, it's a relationships issue," deputy children's commissioner for England Sue Berkowitz said. She says every school should run a comprehensive relationships and sex education programme. "It must cover things like sexting and use of mobile technology, as well as all other aspects of relationships and sex education," she added. </body>

      <title>Fear over part-time student numbers</title>
      <description>Rising fees and pressure on household spending are behind a 40% fall in part-time student numbers, say university leaders.</description>

      <body>A "perfect storm" of causes is leading to a rapid and worrying decline in part-time student numbers in England, university leaders have warned. The Universities UK study blames rising fees, pressure on household budgets and reduced support from employers. It examines why part-time students have fallen by 40% in two years, equivalent to a reduction of 105,000. There are concerns that such part-time courses are necessary to provide the skills needed by industry. Sir Eric Thomas, who headed the review, said "something is going wrong". There has been widespread recognition of the economic importance of part-time courses in allowing adults to improve their skills. Most of the 500,000 students taking part-time courses are adults, a majority are women and most will be studying a vocational or work-related course. But the numbers have been been tumbling for two years and the report says that next year's recruitment figures do not suggest that this downward trend will be reversed. Professor Thomas, who is vice-chancellor of Bristol University, said: "The reality is that the UK needs more graduates and relies heavily on part-time higher education to meet these fast-changing skills needs in a fast-changing world. "We ignore part-time study's transformative power for individuals and society at our peril. "In England in particular, numbers are declining and do not look like rallying." The report says that the sharp decline in numbers reflects a combination of factors. It calls for part-time courses to be seen as an integral part of higher education and "not as an add-on". "There needs to be an urgent push at all levels - national, regional and local - to help potential students and employers understand the value of and opportunities for part-time higher education," says the report. Rachel Wenstone, National Union of Students vice president, said there needed to be more thought about how part-time degree courses were compatible with people's lives. "This obvious decline cannot be swept under the carpet any longer - there needs to be a collective response from all levels to the challenges that these groups of students are facing," she said. The Confederation of British Industry's chief policy director, Katja Hall, said: "It's shocking that the number of part-time undergraduate students has plummeted over the last two years. "For our economy to stay competitive we'll need more people with higher levels of skills, so it's more important than ever that working people have the opportunity to re-train and up-skill." Alex Bols, executive director of the 1994 Group of research-intensive universities, said: "A decline in part-time study could hamper the UK's attempts to extend its skills base and economic growth." </body>

      <title>Few children 'connected to nature'</title>
      <description>Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a three-year study from the RSPB suggests.</description>

      <body>Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a study from the RSPB suggests. The three-year project found that only 21% of children aged 8-12 were "connected to nature". Girls were much more likely than boys to be exposed to the great outdoors, while children in Wales had the lowest score across the UK. The RSPB says that a perception among some adults that nature is dangerous or dirty could be holding children back. There has been an increasing amount of research in recent years underlining the lack of contact and experience with nature among modern children. Some have argued that this is having a negative impact on their health, education and behaviour. In 2012, the National Trust published a report on the phenomenon of "nature deficit disorder", though it is not recognised as a medical condition. The RSPB says its new study is the first to quantify the scale of British children's exposure, or lack of it, to the natural world. They came up with a definition of what "connected to nature" actually means and then developed a questionnaire with 16 statements designed to assess the level of connection among children. Some 1,200 children from across the UK were asked to agree or disagree with these statements. Only 21% of children in the UK had a level of connection with wildlife and the natural world that the RSPB believes should be realistic and achievable for all youngsters. This "realistic and achievable" value is based on the average scores of children visiting RSPB sites or who are junior members of the organisation. One interesting finding was the gender difference. While 27% of girls were at or above the "realistic and achievable" target, only 16% of boys were at the same level. "We need to understand these differences," Sue Armstrong-Brown, head of conservation at the charity, told BBC News. "Whether boys and girls are scoring differently on different questions, are girls more empathetic to nature than boys for instance? We need to analyse the data to find that out." The report also highlighted significant regional differences. Only 13% of children in Wales achieved the basic level of exposure, compared with almost twice this number in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The average score for London was higher than the rest of England. Overall urban children had a slightly higher connection than those living in rural areas. According to Sue Armstrong-Brown, the attitudes of adults may be having a significant effect on children. "There is definitely an attitude out there, in some cases, that nature is not perceived as interesting or engaging. In some cases it is perceived as a dirty or unsafe thing, and that's an attitude that won't help a young person climb a tree." The RSPB hopes that its study will be taken up by government as one of the indicators on the state of children's wellbeing. Sue Armstrong-Brown believes that improving the natural connection for children is not only good for the youngsters, it is crucial for the future of nature conservation in this country. "If we can grow a generation of children that have a connection to nature and do feel a sense of oneness with it, we then have the force for the future that can save nature and stop us living in a world where nature is declining," she said.

      <title>Oxford raises exam reform concerns</title>
      <description>Plans to overhaul A-levels and GCSEs could "wreak havoc" to the exams system in England, Oxford University's admissions tutor says.</description>

      <body>Plans to overhaul A-levels and GCSEs could "wreak havoc" to the exams system in England, Oxford University's admissions tutor has said. Mike Nicholson said universities and schools were worried about the limited evidence available on reforming exams. He said plans to make AS-levels a stand-alone qualification would hinder attempts to increase the numbers of disadvantaged students doing degrees. Ministers said single exams would end the "test treadmill" in sixth-forms. Speaking at a Westminster Education Forum in central London, Mr Nicholson, who is director of undergraduate admissions and outreach at Oxford University, said changing A-levels was "another great example of a government's tendency to meddle in things they should probably just leave alone". He said: "There is widespread concern, not restricted to the secondary-school sector, but also to higher education, about the limited evidence that there is need for any change and widespread concern that the impact of bringing in both GCSE and A-level changes at the same time is going to just wreck the English education system. "Part of the problem is a total misunderstanding and confusion over activities and information that is in the public domain," he said. Under the government's plans, teenagers will no longer take "modular" A-levels with exams throughout but "linear" A-levels with exams at the end of the two-year course. AS-levels will be separated from A-levels to form a qualification in their own right. Mr Nicholson said that there was an assumption that linearity was good, partly because some universities still operated a system of exams at the end of a three-year degree course. But he added that universities had "managed to cope with modularity". He said students also applied for degree courses with different types of qualifications, including the International Baccalaureate, the Cambridge Pre-U and A-levels. Mr Nicholson also raised concerns about the planned changes to the AS-level. "The loss of AS-levels will have tragic consequences for widening participation and access to higher education. "AS-levels are excellent because they give students a very clear indication of what they are capable of achieving. "The real danger is students will plough on believing that they may not be capable of applying to a highly selective course, but equally believing that they are capable of applying to a highly selective and competitive course. "Losing AS-levels will have a really significant result on the likelihood of students from a disadvantaged background progressing to higher education." Mr Nicholson also said there were misconceptions around the A-level subjects that Russell Group universities - which are considered among the best in the UK - required from prospective students. In 2009 - following calls for universities to be clearer about their admissions procedures - the Russell Group published a list of subjects that tended to be required more often than others. Mr Nicholson told Tuesday's forum:"We tried to respond and give advice. That however has been totally misinterpreted. It states very clearly in the document what the intention is. "People choose to ignore that and say what it's basically saying is here are the 12 subjects that will guarantee you a place at a Russell Group university. "That's total nonsense. If you believe that's the case then I'm sorry but you are deluded." He also said that no university required students to have the government's English Baccalaureate at GCSE. This covers English, maths, sciences, a language and history or geography. "If anything, with GCSEs, we much prefer students to have high grades across a range of subjects," Mr Nicholson said. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: "We are putting universities, not politicians, in charge of A-levels to ensure they prepare children for work and higher education. "According to [the exams watchdog] Ofqual, the clear majority of universities favour A-level predictions over AS-levels as an indicator of ability. "Returning A-levels to single exams will end the test treadmill in sixth-forms - something which many teachers complain about." </body>

      <title>Gove urged to monitor free schools</title>
      <description>The education secretary is urged to monitor free schools more closely after a Muslim faith school was closed temporarily because of safety concerns.</description>

      <body>Michael Gove has been urged to monitor free schools more closely after a Muslim faith school was closed temporarily because of safety concerns. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt wrote to Mr Gove saying he was concerned problems at Al-Madinah School revealed a "systemic complacency". The government said it was looking into the school before issues became public. A junior education minister warned the Derby free school it had 17 issues to address including poor standards. Free schools are state-funded schools set up by faith groups, parents, teachers and other individuals and groups. They are directly accountable to the Education Secretary as they are not within the local authority sphere of influence. Al-Madinah School was closed for seven days earlier this month after a single day of inspections by Ofsted which found incomplete records of child protection checks for staff. And concerns were raised about female teachers at the school being told to wear the hijab even if they were not Muslim. In his letter to the education secretary, Mr Hunt said: "In the coming days, we expect Ofsted to publish the inspection report on one of your flagship free schools, the Al-Madinah Free School in Derby. "You will be very aware of the high level of public interest and concern generated by the recent temporary closure of the school and the imminent findings of Her Majesty's Inspectorate. "As I am sure you will agree, there should be no excuse for underperformance in any school. But it is especially troubling that 400 pupils should be deprived of a week of schooling because a publicly funded free school failed in its duty to meet basic child safety requirements." He added: "Moreover, the parliamentary under-secretary of state for schools has recently acknowledged that the Al-Madinah Free School is 'delivering an unacceptably poor standard of education', and I am extremely concerned that this situation could be indicative of a systemic complacency on standards." Mr Hunt went on to ask whether Mr Gove was satisfied with current arrangements for spotting underperformance in free schools. He also asked the education secretary to explain how parents would be provided with a "firm guarantee that their children's education and safety is not being put at risk due to the inadequate oversight of your free school programme". The letter also highlighted claims there were warnings from Ofsted regarding potential issues with welfare, health and safety of pupils at the Derby school before it opened in September 2012. Mr Gove was asked to explain what steps were taken to ensure that these "warnings were heeded" and that "all issues were resolved before the school opened". The Department for Education did not address many of these questions in its statement, but it did say: "We were already investigating this school before allegations became public. We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection. "We have received a response from the Al-Madinah Education Trust. Any decisions made will take into account all the available evidence." The Al-Madinah school was among the first free schools in England with a Muslim ethos, catering for all reception, primary and secondary pupils. But concerns over the application of strict Islamic practices led to a scheduled full inspection being brought forward. A statement on the school website said: "Unsurprisingly, there has been a number of rumours circulating. "While unfortunate, my decision to close the school related to a short-term health and safety issue that has now been completely resolved and will not reoccur." The school has been given a deadline of 22 October to address nine further action points and must provide a plan setting out a clear management structure by the start of November. Ofsted is expected to publish its report on the school in the next week or so. </body>

      <description>Ofsted chief warns of weak leadership in children's services and irresponsible parents.</description>

      <body>"Manifestly and palpably weak" leadership and a high turnover of directors are undermining efforts to improve children's services in England, says Ofsted's chief inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw. There are 20 local authorities rated as inadequate for protecting children. Sir Michael branded Birmingham as an example of bad practice, which he called a "national disgrace". He suggested the local authority might need to be broken up. Sir Michael also called for a wider recognition of the impact of children's home environments, such as irresponsible and alcohol-dependent parents and living on streets lined with betting shops and fast-food shops. Presenting his annual report on social care, Sir Michael delivered a series of hard hitting messages about weaknesses in protecting children. Inspectors only rated four in 10 local authorities as "good" or better for safeguarding. It should be an "urgent priority" of government to examine the role of local authority safeguarding bodies, said Sir Michael. His inspectors had often reported major concerns about these bodies, he said. And he warned about the negative impact of too much "volatility" in the senior leadership in children's services. "One in three local authorities has had a change in their director of children's services last year alone. The combination of unstable communities and political and managerial instability in our social care services is a dangerous mix," said Sir Michael. He warned that poor leadership was often isolated from frontline staff, such as social workers, many of whom felt "profoundly undervalued". Sir Michael said that the average career span in social work was only eight years and the profession faced a "demographic timebomb". He delivered a stinging attack on Birmingham's services for children - accusing them of long-running failures in supporting the safety and well-being of young people in England's biggest authority. The city had a poor record on child mortality and child poverty, he said, and there had been repeated failings in inspections and inadequate serious case reviews. This was "failure of corporate governance on a grand scale", he said. Asked after his speech if he meant that the authority should be broken up, he said that was the implication of his argument. In response a Birmingham City Council spokesman said: "We are already on record as saying that we have failed to meet the basic expectation of keeping vulnerable children in this city safe. This is a long-standing problem which we acknowledge and the leader has said that improving children's services is his number one priority." "What we don't need, however, is simply a repetition of our failings without any proposed solutions," said the council spokesman. Sir Michael also warned of the destructive force of "social breakdown" on young lives and how they were let down by their families. "They lack more than money, they lack parents who will take responsibility," he said. There were 705,000 children living with alcohol-dependent parents and 130,000 in homes where there was domestic violence. "Compassion should not be about making excuses," said Sir Michael, who warned about the corrosive consequences of the "hollowing out and fragmentation" of families. He quoted Louise Casey, the so-called troubled families tsar, as warning that there was too much "pussyfooting around" in supporting families, with too many meetings and too little action. Debbie Jones, Ofsted's national director of social care, said that the child protection system was under "huge pressure", with rising volumes of work at a time when local authority budgets were under pressure. The 20 councils where the standard of child protection services has been judged "inadequate" by Ofsted are: Barnsley, Bexley, Birmingham, Blackpool, Calderdale, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire East, Cumbria, Devon, Doncaster, Herefordshire, Isle of Wight, Kingston upon Thames, Medway, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Rochdale, Sandwell, Slough and Somerset. </body>

      <description>Universities should be brought into the heart of the economy and given funding to drive economic growth, a report urges.</description>

      <body>Universities should be brought into the heart of the economy and funded to stimulate growth, a report is urging. It says the government should put £1bn into what it calls Arrow Projects, to turn "globally competitive technological ideas into real business". Current funding streams are too complex, argues author Sir Andrew Witty, boss of GlaxoSmithKline. The government and the Confederation of British Industry welcomed the report. John Cridland, director general of the CBI, described Arrow Projects as a "great idea". Universities Minister David Willetts said the government would consider what recommendations to make following the publication. "We know that universities are engines of innovation and have an important role to play in driving our industrial strategy," said Mr Willetts. The report, entitled Encouraging a British Invention Revolution, says the UK is a world leader in technology and invention, adding that "the research strength of the UK's universities in an enormous national asset". But it warns: "We will have to work hard to maintain our position of strength in the face of increasing competition." In his foreword, Sir Andrew writes that UK universities have "an extraordinary wealth of ideas, technology and human energy - much of which is world-leading and capable of seeding not just new companies but whole industries". But without better-focused funding, organisation and collaboration, he says, there is a risk of delay and of "British inventions building foreign industries". He says a "thicket of complexity" in funding "leads to unnecessary hurdles for those striving to translate ideas to job-creating businesses". Arrow Projects are his plan for an taking ideas from "mind to factory" with a "globally competitive sense of timing and scale". If they were successful they "could herald a British invention revolution to rival the transformation witnessed in the 19th Century," Sir Andrew writes. He envisages the projects as large collaborations in technologically advanced fields. The partners would not necessarily be "geographically co-located", and would include a range of universities - not just leading research institutions - as well as industry, business and local and central government. The report says the government "will need to create a new funding stream to bring the Arrow Projects into being." This could be composed of both public and private money, from both new or existing sources and delivered perhaps in the form of block grants which would allow project managers to use their judgement as to how it is spent, it says. Universities and businesses would form themselves into consortiums to bid for the funding. The funding would be channelled through the lead university in each project. Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, said: "The future of the UK economy depends upon making the most of the knowledge, innovation and energy to be found in universities. This work is already happening but the report challenges us, quite rightly, to do more." Dr Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group of research universities, also welcomed the proposal: "Discoveries at our world-leading, research-intensive universities have generated billions over the years. "But it's vital for the UK's economy that groundbreaking discoveries make it all the way from idea to implementation and from prototype to profit. "Collaboration with business is a core part of the mission of all our academics. But we need to bridge the gap and help everyone work together." Mr Cridland added: "We also need to ensure that more mid-sized and smaller businesses benefit from the huge potential universities bring. "A single point of entry for companies wishing to engage with universities and a sharper focus on supporting innovation in mid-sized businesses are logical first steps." </body>

      <title>League tables measure eight subjects</title>
      <description>Secondary school league tables in England are to be based on progress in eight subjects, rather than focusing on C grades in five GCSEs.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24521957</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70468000/jpg/_70468411_examrooma.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Secondary school league tables in England are to be re-designed to discourage an over-emphasis on pupils achieving C grades at GCSE, says Schools Minister David Laws. From 2016, schools will be measured on overall results in eight GCSE subjects. There will be four key league table measures, showing pupils' progress as well as final grades. Education Select Committee chairman Graham Stuart has hailed the change as an "educational breakthrough". Mr Stuart said it would remove the "damaging obsession" with the C grade boundary. Setting out the reforms in the House of Commons, Mr Laws said they would remove "perverse incentives for schools to act in a way which is not in the best interests of pupils". It will mean shifting away from the current league table system, where schools are ranked by the percentage of pupils achieving five GCSEs grades A* to C, including English and maths. There had been concerns that a disproportionate amount of attention is paid to pupils on this C/D borderline, to the detriment of pupils who achieve at a much higher or lower level. "This gives schools a huge incentive to focus excessively on the small number of pupils around the five Cs borderline. This is unfair to pupils with the potential to move from E grades to D grades, or from B grades to A grade," said Mr Laws. He told MPs that it could also conceal "coasting" schools in more affluent areas, rewarding them with high positions in the league tables without stretching their pupils to achieve their full potential. From 2016 there will be four league table measures for schools. It will show pupils' achievements across their best eight subjects - including English and maths, three core English Baccalaureate subjects including history, geography, physics, chemistry and languages and three other subjects which can include art, music, drama and business. This result will be shown as an average grade for the school, such as a B-. As well as showing GCSE results there will be a measure of progress, showing how pupils have advanced since taking tests at the end of primary school. This will be expressed as a score showing how much the results vary above or below expected levels. If schools achieve the expected levels they will score zero - and if they are below expected levels, they will have a minus score. There will be extra weighting for specific subjects, with English and maths worth double points. Other measures are the percentage of pupils achieving C grades or higher in English and maths and the proportion gaining the English Baccalaureate subjects, English, maths, history or geography, the sciences (including computing from next year) and a language. The revised league tables will mean changes to the way underperformance and minimum "floor targets" are measured. The new floor targets will be based on the amount of progress pupils should have made since primary school. Mr Laws defined the new floor standard as "progress half a grade lower than reasonable expectations. So, if pupils at a school are expected to average a B in their eight subjects, the school will be below the floor if they average less than four Bs and four Cs". In terms of how this threshold will be shown in the new-look tables, such a half grade below expectations would be expressed as -0.5. If schools perform above expectations in pupil progress, equivalent to a full grade above, or +1.0, they will not face an Ofsted inspection the following year. At present there are 195 schools below the minimum level of achievement, but Mr Law said that if the new plans were applied to current results the number of schools below the threshold would double. "The fact that the new accountability measures will put many more schools below the new floor targets will be devastating to many," said the National Union of Teacher's leader, Christine Blower. But she welcomed the "move away from a 'spotlight' on pupils on the C/D borderline. It still remains the case however that a league table and target culture will persist". Head teachers' leader Brian Lightman said there was much to welcome in the changes, including the shift away from focusing on the C grade boundary. But Mr Lightman, leader of the Association of School and College Leaders, said this was "seriously undermined by other ad hoc changes to the examination system". Mary Bousted, leader of the ATL teachers' union, backed the principle of "prioritising the progress schools make with their pupils rather than simply rewarding those with the top grades". But she cautioned that the measurements of progress depended on the reliability of Sats results as the starting point - saying that their validity "cannot be counted on". Mr Stuart welcomed the changes to the league table system: "These plans are an educational breakthrough that will blow away the damaging obsession with the C/D grade boundary and help every child achieve the best possible results." Chris Paterson, author of a report on school accountability for the think tank Centre Forum, said: "Getting the measure that drives school league tables right could be the single most important education reform of the coalition government." </body>

      <description>The tough struggle to modernise Kurdistan's education system</description>

      <body>Prof Dlawer Ala'Aldeen had tomatoes, stones and apples thrown at him. He faced countless demonstrations. The reason for this hostility, facing the microbiologist from the University of Nottingham, was his controversial attempt to reform the university system in his birthplace of Kurdistan. Prof Ala'Aldeen was the architect of plans to improve the quality and to internationalise higher education in Iraqi Kurdistan. He says he was up against "deeply entrenched interests, people, institutions and long stagnant cultures". The region, autonomous for two decades in the wake of the Gulf War, had inherited a post-Saddam university system that Prof Ala'Aldeen has described as "grossly outdated" and designed for a closed, centralised country. In 2009 Prof Ala'Aldeen was given a secondment away from his job as professor of clinical microbiology at Nottingham University in the UK. He stepped from academic life in the English midlands into the role of Kurdistan's higher education minister, a post he held until last year. Prime Minister Barham Salih, a good friend, chose him for his knowledge of the higher education system and the series of critical articles on education and governance he had written in the years up to his appointment. Barham Salih's election manifesto had included significant support for higher education and training to support Kurdistan's large population of under 20 year olds. There were already plans for more scholarships to send talented students to study overseas. Within a week of being appointed, Prof Ala'Aldeen had written up a radical vision document and it was quickly endorsed by the cabinet. Higher education in Kurdistan was suffering a major crisis of quality, capacity and infrastructure. There was a consensus in support of reform and it helped that Prof Ala'Aldeen had been very critical of the government in the past. The reforms, which planned to improve the quality and accreditation of university teachers, brought considerable opposition from student and teacher organisations as well as businesses linked with the burgeoning market in private universities. Several new private universities were threatened with closure, much to the anger of their staff and prospective students who had paid fees for their courses. "Many teachers had been licensed prematurely. There were 11 private universities when I started with 18 more waiting to be opened. These mushrooming private colleges were relying on the same pool of resources as the public universities which lacked staff and facilities," Prof Ala'Aldeen says. The problem of staffing was particularly acute in medicine, pharmacy and dentistry and in postgraduate studies. But Prof Ala'Aldeen faced protests and opposition. He was accused of trying to transplant the UK system onto Kurdistan, something he vehemently denies since he was educated and worked in his home region, before coming to study in the UK. "I knew the system from the inside and studied what had happened in similar countries. I wanted to apply international principles of quality, but tailor-made to Kurdish traditions," he says. He responded by redoubling his efforts to communicate the purpose of the reforms, which also included curriculum development, moving beyond a single teacher delivering a lecture to a class, the introduction of an electronic admissions system and reforming the teaching of PhDs. In the end, the government closed three private universities as well as five health-related colleges, three pharmacy colleges and two dentistry ones. "If we had allowed the system to keep evolving as it was it would have taken at least a generation to fix it - a generation would have been wasted. We knew we had to act fast. It was a risky policy, but it would have been far riskier to do nothing," he says. The speed of his action was criticised as were aspects of the efforts to improve teaching standards, such as student feedback being used to measure teacher performance and pay. There was also opposition to teachers being asked to engage in professional development once a week. Prof Brendan O'Leary, director of the programme in ethnic conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a longer process might have worked better. But he says it was against a background when unprecedented changes were happening in Kurdish society as the region opened up to foreign investment. "The Kurdistan region is going through a difficult and fast-paced transformation. "Ideally a long and rich discussion is needed to agree new institutional conditions to enable higher education to flourish in a region emerging from decades of destruction, war, genocide, internal fighting, academic isolation and lack of resources. "University and institutional reforms are more likely to succeed if all the stakeholders have clear ideas on what to do, when, and at what pace. One should not be surprised if people with vested interests fear reforms," said Prof O'Leary. Thomas Hill, assistant professor at New York University Center for Global Affairs, adds: "I do not believe there is consensus even now that the reforms the former minister wanted to implement would have been in the best interest of the Kurdistan region. "There are many, many people with very conservative views within the higher education sector in the Kurdistan region and many did not and do not like the progressive path the former minister was plotting." There were areas in which vested interests remained unmoved. Prof Ala'Aldeen could not increase the independence of universities. The government continues to choose university leaders and universities have been totally dependent on government funding. Prof Ala'Aldeen put together draft legislation on institutional autonomy, but says the challenge to the status quo was too great to push it through. He is in close touch with the current government and is pleased that the reforms to improve quality have been maintained, despite the fact that there is still not consensus in favour of them, and says the scholarship programme is already making a difference. "Almost 3,000 students have studied abroad, the majority in the UK. Half of these are or will be back by the end of this year. They will provide leadership and bring a breath of fresh air. They will link their institutions to the outside world and break Kurdistan's academic isolation." Although Kurdistan has its own particular circumstances, Prof Ala'Aldeen says that the problems facing the university system are not unique - and that the model for modernisation could be applied elsewhere in the Middle East. "The problems are generic and the solutions can be implemented anywhere in the world." Commentators on Kurdistan's politics agree. Prof O'Leary says: "The Kurdistan region, Iraq and several other states in the Middle East are going through dramatic changes, and in some cases, deeply regrettable authoritarian restorations. "Most institutions are highly politicised in these societies. If the Kurdistan region can successfully reform its education system, including higher education, it can provide a model for the wider Middle East." </body>

      <title>Harvard plans to boldly go with 'Spocs'</title>
      <description>Harvard develops the next big thing for online learning. Is this the real deal?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24166247</url>

      <body>Keep up, keep up. If you've only just caught on to the concept of online university courses called Moocs, then you're in danger of falling behind again. Harvard, one of the world's most influential universities, is moving on to Spocs - which stands for small private online courses. Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go". And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc". Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up. Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection. But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered. Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts. The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted. It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses. At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds? Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands. It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits. Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model. Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students. Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials. Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information". These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work. Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus. It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences. Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX. He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility". And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution". "The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era." "What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue. It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications? The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says. "It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area." There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning. A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs. The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue". The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time. Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus. "What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?" If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"? Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective. Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests. "The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better." "Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem." </body>

      <title>UK enters online university race</title>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses. Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers. The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses. It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts. Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar". He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas. The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet. The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project. The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students. There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year. In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications. But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them. It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options. When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations. FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution. They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students. Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront". But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs. Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming. "Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor. "Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities. "Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study." Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course. FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting. He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture". This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content. This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University. "Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean. There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England. Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford. Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities. These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates. It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online. These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams. Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard. On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses. But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses. Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT. He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online. Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance. "The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow. "The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system." Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets." </body>

      <title>Gordon Brown's Syrian refugee school plan</title>
      <description>Syria's refugee crisis is also threatening to become a long-term education disaster.</description>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks. "A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon. As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school. Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks. It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school. But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (£319m). The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy. This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds. Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived. The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes. Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population. But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling. The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war. Forty years ago Médecins Sans Frontières established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones. Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief. Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations. Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence. On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees. In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds. It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world." </body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>

      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education? In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show. This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead. Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course. Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show. A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics". Showbiz lessons The show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience". She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show". The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids. It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive. This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week. Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education. And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning. Dumbing down? This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection. There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time. But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus? "When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university. "The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show." Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples. "In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course." Apocalypse studies Josh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show. "This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental." "This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters." Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning? "Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says. He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet. "The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says. Personal learning For the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online. "The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble. "The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that." These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students. Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities. But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected. William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs. And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate. They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says. Spoiler alert Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses. Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary. "The student must be able to sift the evidence. "For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says. Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment. But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected. With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert. </body>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied. The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies. There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea. The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place. This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies. One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard. This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone. This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (£20bn' 23.5bn euro). But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings. Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique. It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo. Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe. In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place. But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities. Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin. Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart. </body>

      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority. The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel. They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history. Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research. The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers. Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule. He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics. Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis? "Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months." Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him. There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav. The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more". It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating. "They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way." When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders. "My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey." While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain. The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics. It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain. It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman. Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933. He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil. "It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people." He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living". The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs. This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy. According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939. Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard. There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him. Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort. In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won. Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen. There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake. In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen. Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls. But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue. Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism. What lessons should be learned from all this? Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year. It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions". There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said. The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world. But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve. His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society. His father, remembered for his science research, played Bach on the piano every day. These were internationalists, their ideas and research moving across national and political boundaries. Such a world proved fragile in the face of the Nazis. And Gustav Born says people can too often overlook that Germany had still been a young country in the 1930s, little more than 60 years old, and that it hadn't built the institutions able to resist its own "militaristic and nationalistic" tendencies. He is very much aware that he is now one of the few remaining people who can talk first-hand about such a legacy. "I'm sad that it almost ends with me. "I want them not to forget that things like this, the suppression of a country by a gang of murderous crooks and the victimisation of people of good nature and good intention, it could happen again." </body>

      <title>Education is a 'security issue', says UN</title>
      <description>Unesco chief says even though pledge for education for all will be missed, huge progress has been achieved.</description>

      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says. Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school. The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education. But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success. In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling. After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely. "By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco. But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million. "If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%." Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom. Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate. So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova. It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places. Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding. In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers. But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance. Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments. "Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism. "The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society." The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says. Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general. "Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis. "But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking. "We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education." Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls. Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls. Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem. "One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says. "It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn." And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal. "It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy. "There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect. "This is the best thing that could happen to humanity." The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute. A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school. It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong. A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict. In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls. In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed. The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students. Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed. Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward. This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results". But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school. It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow. "In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument." </body>

      <body>A school which let pupils as young as 11 smoke in the playground has been ordered to stop the practice. Leeds City Council education bosses stepped in after learning children at Elmete Central School in Roundhay, Leeds, were allowed to smoke. It is understood cigarettes were confiscated at the start of the day but returned at break times in an attempt to stop pupils playing truant. Elmete caters for 75 pupils with educational and behavioural issues. Paul Brennan, deputy director for children's services, said the council spoke with the school's recently-appointed head teacher Lesley Boyd as soon as it was made aware pupils were smoking on the premises. He said he was now "confident" the practice had ceased. "The recently-appointed head teacher has agreed to review any such practices, and to make sure this does not happen in the future we will conduct unannounced visits by local authority staff," he said. "We have a strict no-smoking policy in all of our schools and encourage them to promote healthy lifestyles to all pupils." A council spokesman added that Lesley Boyd was not the head teacher at the time the policy was introduced. </body>

      <body>Slang such as "ain't", "innit" and "coz" has been banned from a school in south London to try to help students find future employment. Harris Academy Upper Norwood said it implemented the initiative to allow its students to "express themselves confidently and appropriately". Pupils heard using "informal language" will be asked to "reflect" on it. Other banned words include "like", "bare" and "extra" and the phrases "you woz" and "we woz". Starting sentences with "basically" and ending them with "yeah" is also considered to be too informal at the Croydon school. In a statement, the school said: "In addition to giving students the teaching they need to thrive academically, we want them to develop the soft skills they will need to compete for jobs and university places. "This particular initiative is just one of the many ways in which we are building the vocabulary of our students and giving them the skills they need to express themselves confidently and appropriately for a variety of audiences." Terry Victor, editor of the New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English said: "It's wrong. "You cannot censor a young person's language, they're not talking about words that are offensive, they're talking about some of the words that politicians use. "[The word] 'ain't' was around in the 19th Century, people like Dickens used it... and how many politicians have you heard say "basically" to begin a sentence? "Yes, it's irritating but it's part of deliberate language." Harris Academy Upper Norwood opened last month, replacing a secondary school that was in special measures. </body>

      <description>Record numbers of UK university students are opting to spend a year studying or working abroad says the British Council.</description>

      <body>Record numbers of UK university students are opting to spend a year studying or working abroad, says the British Council. More than 14,500 UK students took part in the European Union's Erasmus student exchange scheme in 2012-13, the highest since it was launched in 1987. But the UK lags behind France, Germany and Spain, where almost three times as many students are on the scheme. The British Council says foreign study has been shown to boost job prospects. Ruth Sinclair-Jones, of the British Council, described the scheme as "an ideal way to learn another language and culture". "As the number of specialist foreign language courses decline in the UK, Erasmus is becoming even more essential. "The international experience offered through Erasmus has been shown to make a real difference in terms of people's employability." The British Council has managed Erasmus in the UK for the past six years. Since then, the number of UK students on the scheme has more than doubled, according to British Council data. The latest UK participation figures show a rise of 7% on the previous year. In all, more than 2.5 million students across Europe have taken part in the scheme. Despite the recent rise, the UK is still well behind other major European countries - the latest figures show 39,000 Spanish students took part in the scheme in 2011-12, along with 33,300 from Germany and 33,200 from France. Last year the University of Nottingham was the UK institution to send the largest number of students on to Erasmus exchanges, with 522 participants. The scheme is also popular among students at other members of the Russell Group of research based universities. Last year Leeds sent 459 students, Sheffield 447, Manchester 438 and Bristol 422. Although the numbers are rising across the UK, there has been particular success in Scotland, with 1,877 students taking part last year. Some 13% of Erasmus participants last year came from Scottish institutions, which represent just 8.5% of the UK student population. The University of Edinburgh was the most enthusiastic Erasmus participant in Scotland, with 356 students on the scheme. Vincenzo Raima, director of Nottingham's international office, said the university had set a target for 25% of its undergraduates to be taking part in some form of international scheme or experience by 2015-15. "All the evidence out there tells us that students who undertake international activities gain the additional skills employers are looking for," said Mr Raima. </body>

      <title>Muslim school changes headscarf rule</title>
      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby, which is threatened with closure, says it will support female staff who do not wish to wear head coverings.</description>

      <body>A Muslim free school in Derby has said it will support female staff who do not want to wear head coverings. It follows a letter warning the Al-Madinah School it faced closure unless discrimination against female staff and pupils stopped. Education Minister Lord Nash laid out 17 issues for the school to consider, which included an end to "unacceptable" teaching standards. The letter said if steps were not taken by Tuesday, funding would be pulled. Parent-governor Abdullah Shahjan told BBC Radio Derby: "We are amending policies to make sure we support staff, who if for their cultural, ethical, or faith do not wish to cover their hair." Another governor Fasal Hussain said: "We are very open, very flexible." However, with regard to Lord Nash's letter and female staff wearing head scarves he added: "We would have appreciated some consultation. "We have never received any complaints from our staff." One of the other concerns raised in the letter was that women and girls were being treated less favourably than men and boys. Head of Islamic studies, Mohammad Burhaan, said: "We are an Islamic school and if we were to discriminate against women in any way we wouldn't be faithful to our faith. "If you look at the tradition of Islam, it has a very rich history and heritage of female scholarship - both religious and in the field of science, languages and mathematics - we are very proud of that heritage. "If we were going to discriminate we would have applied to be a single-gender school from the outset." He said the chair of governors was female, most staff were female and most pupils were female. "I think actions speak louder than words and we can't give a bolder statement to our dedication to equality of gender than that," he said. During an earlier interview on Newsnight, Mr Burhaan said head scarves were the code of dress adopted by the school. "If you look at an air hostess, for example, a female wears a different code of dress. "We are not saying they are discriminated against, that's a choice made by the business," he said then. The government had told the school to write to all female members of staff telling them they did not have to wear a hijab if it was in conflict with their religion or beliefs. In the letter outlining concerns, Lord Nash wrote: "The trust has manifestly breached the conditions of its funding agreement by: "I will not tolerate breaches of the commitments you gave when entering into the funding agreement." He urged the school's trust to take five "urgent steps" by 15 October, including providing written confirmation that "you have ceased any practices and procedures that have as their reason, cause or effect that women and girls are treated less favourably than men and boys". The school has been given a deadline of 22 October to address nine further action points and must provide a plan setting out a clear management structure by the start of November. </body>

      <title>Labour backs parent-led schools</title>
      <description>Labour says it will support parents who want to set up new schools but the Conservatives say the opposition's policy on school choice has not changed.</description>

      <body>Labour is "on the side" of parents who want to set up schools and would not shut most existing free schools, the new shadow education secretary insists. Tristram Hunt told the BBC Labour backed "enterprise and innovation" when it came to increasing school places. He said a Labour government would push ahead with what it called parent-led academies in areas of educational need. Tory chairman Grant Shapps said Labour's policy was unchanged and it still opposed the "popular" schools. Free schools, set up by parents and other groups and operating outside local authority control, have been established under a policy pioneered by Education Secretary Michael Gove. More than 170 have been opened across England since September 2011. Labour has been accused by the government of sending out mixed messages about the party's support, opposing their roll-out nationally but backing schools locally. Mr Hunt, who has just taken over from Stephen Twigg as the party's education spokesman, said he regretted previously describing free schools as a "vanity project for yummy mummies". He made the comments in 2010 shortly after becoming an MP. Mr Hunt told BBC One's Andrew Marr programme Labour would not open new free schools "along the Michael Gove model", but that the bulk of existing free schools would be kept open as his party wanted to "keep the good free schools". Citing the case of the Al-Madinah free school in Derby, which was closed for a week earlier this month on the first day of an Ofsted inspection, Mr Hunt said Labour would not allow schools to become an "ideological experiment". Education Minister Lord Nash has warned the school would be closed unless "unacceptable" teaching standards improved. Its acting head teacher said there were areas the school needed to address and it was co-operating with Ofsted. "What is going on with the Al-Madinah school is a terrifying example of the mistakes of Michael Gove's education policy," he said. New schools, he added, should only be opened in areas where there was a shortage of places, where "properly qualified" staff could be recruited and where institutions were financially accountable. Under Labour's plans, parent-led academies would enable parent groups and other organisations to set up schools outside local authority control, although local authorities would have greater powers to intervene when there were concerns about standards. "If you are a group of parents, social entrepreneurs and teachers interested in setting up a school in areas where you need new school places, then the Labour government will be on your side. "We are in favour of enterprise and innovation." But a Conservative Party spokesman said shadow chancellor Ed Balls had made it clear in a speech in June that the party would curb new schools in areas where they was an "excess" of places. Mr Balls had suggested a future Labour government would prioritise resources on areas where school places were in "short supply". Mr Shapps told the BBC: "This is the same old Labour policy. Free schools will only be allowed in specific circumstances in specific areas with a whole load of bureaucracy attached. "Free schools have been driving up standards. They are hugely popular with parents and up to now Labour have fought tooth and nail against them including voting against them and what they said today has changed absolutely nothing." Journalist Toby Young, who helped set up a free school in west London, said Mr Hunt had been "less than candid" about Labour's policy as it was considering granting councils the power of veto over free schools in their boroughs. Writing in his blog for the Daily Telegraph, Mr Young - who has said he is considering of applying to be a Conservative candidate at the next election - said this would be a "retrograde step" since councils would be unlikely to approve new schools close to existing ones which were under-performing. Mr Hunt said there needed to be more focus on vocational education with support for further education colleges and apprenticeships in industry. </body>

      <title>Meeting over funding of NI schools</title>
      <description>People give their views about how schools are funded at a public meeting in Belfast.</description>

      <body>People have been giving their views about how schools are funded at a public meeting in Belfast. In June, the education minister proposed changes to the Common Funding Scheme, which determines how funds are allocated to Northern Ireland schools. The proposals had been brought forward by an independent panel of experts who examined the current scheme. They found it was outdated, too complicated and was failing pupils. The panel recommended a simpler funding formula and financial incentives so that smaller schools are better off if they join with schools nearby. The meeting on Monday evening was attended by about 40 people. The majority of those were teachers, with a number of parents there as well. Concerns were raised at the meeting about how the funding changes are implemented. A Department of Education spokesperson said: "When the minister set out the way ahead for how local schools are funded, he undertook to gather the views of everyone who might be affected, or with an interest, who wishes to have their say. "Schools already have a mechanism for responding to the consultation, but, in keeping with the minister's views, we wanted to be able to engage with a wider audience. "This public meeting in Belfast follows one held already in Omagh and enables those who wish to put their views across verbally to have their say. "It forms part of the wider consultation process that has included an online response form, children's and young people's versions and focussed engagement with parents, children and young people." The consultation closes on Friday 18 October. </body>

      <body>Ministers are being urged to review care provided for children with disabilities following research into the adequacy of support for families. Children's commissioner for England Maggie Atkinson called the findings "heart-rending" and "disturbing". The report suggested some families were unable to afford basic necessities for "a dignified life". The Department for Work and Pensions said the report contained "a small sample, presenting a partial picture". The study, carried out by the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) for the children's commissioner, found evidence that poverty meant some disabled children were not living lives that met international human rights standards. Ms Atkinson said the research findings were "not an easy read". "This is about voicelessness and powerlessness, as well as about making ends meet," she said. "It's very poignant and very difficult to hear the stories. "Money issues are very real and very challenging, but parents are equally saying they have little or no say in the ways services are planned and provided, from transport to access to youth, or play or leisure which is properly adapted for one's disability." The research was based on interviews and group discussions with 78 disabled children and young people and 17 parents. It was co-led by a team of 11 disabled children and young people working with the university. A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions rejected some of the conclusions. "In fact, independent reports show how we are world leaders in support for disabled people with the UK's spending on disability-related benefits a fifth higher than the EU average. "The UK is also acknowledged as a world leader in supporting independent living for disabled people, having the best overall rating of 55 countries. "We continue to spend around £50bn a year on disabled people and their services and our reforms will make sure the billions spent give more targeted support to those who need it most." Ms Atkinson acknowledged the government's response, but stressed some of the "personal stories" she had heard painted a different picture. She said: "I would like some of the officials who have no doubt written that statement to come and meet some of the young people, who will tell the very true story of living with a disability on a very low income, and then I would ask them to say that again. "There is a mum quoted in the survey, who because her child needs an adapted home, including a multi-sensory environment... was persuaded to make sure that was available. "She will be paying for it until November 2022. "There is also a young woman going through everything that adolescence brings with it, who needs incontinence pads. "The benefits pay for four-a-day, she needs 10. That is not human dignity and it is not human rights either." Despite the criticism, researchers found "many examples" of disabled children receiving good care and services which they said "demonstrate how low income does not have to be a barrier". But evidence was also found of inadequate services, compounding the problems of some low income families. The authors said that although families with disabled children often have rights to welfare payments and practical support, their basic incomes often do not cover the extra costs of raising and caring for a disabled child. The team analysed three United Nations treaty documents: the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on Persons with Disabilities and the International Covenant on Economic and Social Rights. Between them these treaties specify individuals' rights to food, clothes and heating, to live independently, to be able to decide where to live, to live in their local communities and to the support and services they need to be able to do that. The researchers found the lives lived by some disabled children and young people did not meet these basic rights. "There were accounts of some disabled children, young people and their parents not being able to heat their homes properly or afford adequate clothing and food," said the paper. "Some were not informed or involved in decisions about changes to where they lived. "Some experienced delays in adaptations being made to their homes and some did not have enough space nor support for independent living." </body>

      <title>Toddler brain scan language insight</title>
      <description>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest.</description>

      <body>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest. Environmental influences have their biggest impact before the age of four, as the brain's wiring develops to process new words, say UK and US scientists. The research in The Journal of Neuroscience suggests disorders causing language delay should be tackled early. It also explains why young children are good at learning two languages. The scientists, based at King's College London, and Brown University, Rhode Island, studied 108 children with normal brain development between the ages of one and six. They used brain scans to look at myelin - the insulation that develops from birth within the circuitry of the brain. To their surprise, they found the distribution of myelin is fixed from the age of four, suggesting the brain is most plastic in very early life. Any environmental influences on brain development will be strongest in infanthood, they predict. This explains why immersing children in a bilingual environment before the age of four gives them the best chance of becoming fluent in both languages, the research suggests. It also suggests that there is a critical time during development when environmental influence on cognitive skills may be greatest. Dr Jonathan O'Muircheartaigh, from King's College London, led the study. He told the BBC: "Since our work seems to indicate that brain circuits associated with language are more flexible before the age of four, early intervention for children with delayed language attainment should be initiated before this critical age. "This may be relevant to many developmental disorders, such as autism, since delayed language is a common early trait." Early childhood is a time when language skills develop very rapidly. Babies have a vocabulary of up to 50 words at 12 months but by the age of six this has expanded to about 5,000 words. Language skills are localised in the frontal areas of the left-hand side of the brain. The researchers therefore expected more myelin to develop in the left-hand side of the brain, as the children learned more language. In fact, they found it remained constant, but had a stronger influence on language ability before the age of four, suggesting there is a crucial window for interventions in developmental disorders. "This work is important as it is the first to investigate the relationship between brain structure and language across early childhood and demonstrate how this relationship changes with age," said Dr Sean Deoni from Brown University, a co-researcher on the study. "This is important since language is commonly altered or delayed in many developmental disorders, such as autism." Commenting on the study, Prof Dorothy Bishop of the department of Developmental Neuropsychology at the University of Oxford said the research added important new information about early development of connections in brain regions important for cognitive functions. "There is suggestive evidence of links with language development but it is too early to be confident about functional implications of the findings," she said. "Ideally we would need a longitudinal study following children over time to track how structural brain changes relate to language function." The study was funded by the National Institutes for Mental Health (US) and the Wellcome Trust (UK). </body>

      <title>Why did it go wrong at Al-Madinah?</title>
      <description>What does the Al-Madinah case say about free schools?</description>

      <body>Described as "dysfunctional" and "in chaos", there can be no doubt that the problems at the Al-Madinah School go right to its core. Rated inadequate in all four inspection areas, Ofsted said problems at the Derby school were "myriad". Not only does it lack the basic structures needed to operate, it is said to be close to "collapsing". Al-Madinah is the second free school to be put into special measures, after Discovery Free School in May 2013. A further five out of the 24 inspected so far have been labelled "requiring improvement" - the next worse category. But then it is only two years into the programme. Across England the latest Ofsted figures show that 2% of state schools are in special measures - 383 out of 21,186 inspections. But no up-and-running free school has unravelled quite so publicly as this Derby-based Muslim faith school. It started with claims about female staff being required to wear hijabs, Islamic headscarves, but the focus has shifted to the "unacceptable" level of education the government and inspectors now say it is providing. The key thing that makes this Ofsted report stand out, is the fact that the findings come just a year after the school opened. Most schools that deteriorate tend to do so over a much longer period of time. And many of the problems it highlights seem to have implications for the particular nature of free schools and the extra freedoms they are allowed. The report's second line says: "This is a school which has been set up and run by representatives of the community with limited knowledge and experience." Education Secretary Michal Gove argued that taking schools out of the hands of bureaucrats would liberate innovators to push up standards through reform and experimentation. But the Ofsted findings in this case reflect exactly what detractors of such DIY school projects feared would happen. They asked how people who knew little about education could set up and run something so complex and important as a school. In addition, teaching, which the government sees as the most important engine raising attainment, was found to be "inadequate". "Many teachers are inexperienced and have not received the training and support they need," the Ofsted report said. This seems to highlight one of the most fundamental differences between free schools and regular state schools - there is no obligation to employ qualified teachers in England's free schools. The Department for Education argued that it gave free schools this freedom, which exists amongst independent schools, to enable them to employ industry experts. But this does not appear to have worked in the pupils' favour in the Al-Madinah case. The Ofsted report said: "Almost all teaching seen during the inspection, including in the Early Years Foundation Stage, was judged inadequate." It added that most teaching and lessons in the primary school were poorly planned and that teachers did not know how to use pupils' assessments to plan lessons and set work. Questions are now being asked about how the Department for Education could approve a school for opening one year, only for it to be found to lack the "basic systems" it needs to operate 12 months later. Were the checks necessary for ensuring the school would be fit for purpose undertaken in a sufficiently rigorous way? Judging from the pre-registration report undertaken by Ofsted in the July before it opened, no assessment was made by the inspectorate of the school's ability to educate pupils. But Ofsted did wave the red flag at this stage over child protection measures, saying that four regulations had not yet been met and that staff needed to undertake training on such issues. This was highlighted by shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt in an emergency question in the Commons. The DfE has insisted that it took all necessary steps to ensure the school was fit for purpose when it opened in September 2012. It said: "Ofsted recommended Al-Madinah should be registered as long as four requirements were met. "Ofsted often sets out a number of requirements it wants to see before new schools can open. In this case, [Al-Madinah Education Trust] provided the necessary evidence to show that these requirements were met." But the report also said the school had "not been adequately monitored or supported". Prime Minister David Cameron has taken to local radio to say that the school should close if it does not take immediate action to put things right. But he also said that this particular case should not be used as a "stick to beat the whole free school movement" as these were delivering a better standard of education than most state schools. He quoted figures hailed by the DfE earlier in the year which said three-quarters of the first free schools were rated good or outstanding - which a spokesman pointed out was a significantly higher proportion than all state schools. But a check of the latest Ofsted data reveals that a higher proportion of state schools (78%) are rated good or outstanding compared with 75% of free schools. But Mr Hunt said the education of children in Derby was being sacrificed for ideology. He added: "It's not just the Al-Madinah School which is dysfunctional, it's the education secretary's free school policy." </body>

      <title>Digging deep on social mobility</title>
      <description>Stagnating social mobility warning - are the young paying the price?</description>

      <body>Alan Milburn says he was asked by the coalition to "hold its feet to the fire" in examining its progress on social mobility and child poverty. But just how much will his words hurt? In this, the first of what is planned to be an annual "State of the Nation report", the commission led by the former Labour health secretary concludes that "Britain remains a deeply divided country", one where "being born poor often leads to a lifetime of poverty". The commission says austerity has made it even harder to break ingrained cycles of poverty, that "disadvantage and advantage cascade down the generations". It warns there is a danger that social mobility will go in to reverse after rising in the middle of the last century and "flatlining" towards the end of it. The post-war years saw a big expansion of the middle classes, as the professional jobs market grew and more people bought their own homes, but there has been little change in the last quarter of the century. Mr Milburn said over decades, the UK had become a wealthier society, but had "struggled to become a fairer one" and had more children living in poverty and lower levels of social mobility than "many other developed nations". A total of 2.3 million children (one in six) live in poverty, he said, and this made it essential that the pattern where "birth not worth" determined a person's chances in life was changed. Higher social mobility had become "the new holy grail of public policy". It is certainly something all parties now say they want to see. The report from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission has stinging words on some areas of government policy but they are sweetened with praise for others, including the fact that the coalition continues to "stick to its commitments" on ending child poverty and improving social mobility in "challenging times". Mr Milburn told journalists at a news conference the government "deserved credit" for that. But the target of ending child poverty by 2020 - begun under Labour and continued by the coalition government - would "in all likelihood" be missed, he said. His most stinging criticism seemed to be about the way the young were likely to pay the highest price for a lack of social mobility and poverty during the global financial crisis. He called for older generations to be asked to dig deeper. The number of young people who have been unemployed for two years or more is at a "20-year high", he said. And there was an "inter-generational unfairness" in terms of who was being asked to pick up the bill in the recession. He did not call for pension cuts, but Mr Milburn said politicians should be prepared to "break political taboos" to talk about whether wealthier pensioners should lose benefits currently available to all - particularly the winter fuel allowance and the free TV licence. Pensioners were usually more worried about their grandchildren than themselves, he said. The commission is also looking to employers to do more - to offer better training, pay higher wages and open up professions to a wider pool of people. Two-thirds of children living in poverty, the report says, are living in homes with a working parent. Schools and universities were also urged to do more. He said schools in some areas were letting down pupils from poorer homes and those from middle-income homes too. Schools should give more help to low-achievers from middle-income homes as well as the poorest, while the government should improve careers advice, give extra incentives for teachers to teach in the worst schools and pay colleges "by results they achieve for their students in the labour market - not the numbers they recruit". As for universities - which were the focus of an earlier report by the commission - he says the sector as a whole has drawn in more students from poorer homes but top institutions remain out of reach for too many. Each year, he said, there were 3,700 "missing" state school pupils who had achieved the grades needed to get in to universities in the Russell Group (which represents some of the UK's leading universities) but did not go to them. The commission called for the government to put social mobility at the heart of its policies and practices, so that it was a "golden thread" running through all it did. It concentrated on the overall UK picture, but pointed out that in Scotland and Wales, the issue "currently has a low profile". In an age of austerity, the report's authors suggest creating a fairer society will be a job for all - and far from pain-free. </body>

      <body>Zhang Yang, a bright 18-year old from a rural town in Anhui province in China was accepted to study at a prestigious traditional medicine college in Hefei. But the news was too much for his father Zhang Jiasheng. Zhang's father was partly paralysed after he suffered a stroke two years ago and could no longer work. He feared the family, already in debt to pay for medicines, would not be able to afford his son's tuition fees. As his son headed home to celebrate his success, Zhang Jiasheng killed himself by swallowing pesticide. Zhang's case is an extreme. But East Asian families are spending more and more of their money on securing their children the best possible education. In richer Asian countries such as South Korea and emerging countries like China, "education fever" is forcing families to make choices, sometimes dramatic ones, to afford the bills. There are families selling their apartments to raise the funds to send their children to study overseas. Andrew Kipnis, an anthropologist at Australian National University and author of a recent book on the intense desire for education in China, says the amount spent on education is "becoming extreme". It is not just middle-class families. Workers also want their children to do better than themselves and see education as the only means of ensuring social mobility. Some go deep into debt. "Families are spending less on other things. There are many cases of rural parents not buying healthcare that their doctors urge on them... Part of the reason is that they would rather spend the money on their children's education," said Mr Kipnis. "Parents may be forced to put off building a new house, which they might have been able to do otherwise," said Mr Kipnis who did the bulk of his research in Zouping district in Shandong province, among both middle-class and rural households. "It can be very intense. They often borrow from relatives. Of course some people have difficulty paying it back," said Mr Kipnis. A Euromonitor survey found that per capita annual disposable income in China rose by 63.3% in the five years to 2012, yet consumer expenditure on education rose by almost 94%. It's not just the parents' incomes. Educating a child has become an extended-family project. "It goes beyond tiger mothers, it also includes tiger grandmothers and grandfathers," said Todd Maurer, an expert on education in Asia and partner at the consultancy firm, Sinica Advisors. There is evidence of high levels of education spending in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Spending is also increasing in India and Indonesia. In South Korea, where the government believes "education obsession" is damaging society, family expenditure on education has helped push household debt to record levels. According to the LG Economic Research Institute, 28% of South Korean households cannot afford monthly loan repayments, and are hard pressed to live off their incomes. A huge proportion of that income - 70% of Korean household expenditure, according to estimates by the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul, goes toward private education, to get an educational edge over other families. Families cut back on other household spending "across the board," said Michael Seth, professor of Korean history at James Madison University in the US and author of a book on South Korea's education zeal. "There is less money to spend on other things like housing, retirement, or vacations." "Every developing country in Asia, specially China, seems to have a similar pattern," said Prof Seth. A highly competitive examination system and rising aspirations are often blamed. "The Korean education system puts enormous pressure on children," said Prof Seth." The only way to opt out of the system is not to have children. It is so expensive to educate a child that it is undoubtedly a factor in South Korea's very low birth rate," he said. The education obsession is so all consuming that the South Korean government has unsuccessfully tried to curb it, concerned about family spending on extra-curricular lessons and cram schools for ferociously competitive exams. While not yet at South Korean levels, China's education fever also puts pressure on family spending. A recent survey by market research company Mintel, found that nine out of 10 children from middle class families in China attended fee-charging after-school activities. Parents believe these activities will help their children when it comes to university entry. Children are being tutored for longer, starting younger. Where before it was for a year or two before the university entrance exam, now it can start in middle school or even primary. Matthew Crabbe, Asia research director at Mintel, says that people in China are using the savings that might have been put aside for healthcare. "But because the cost of education has risen and the competition for places at good universities have become so much more intense, they are investing more of their savings to make sure the child can get the grades they would need to get in." It does not stop there. Nearly 87% of Chinese parents said they were willing to fund study abroad. In the past an overseas education was confined to the most privileged. Now many more want foreign degrees to give them a shortcut to success. According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a third of Chinese students studying abroad in 2010 were from working-class families. This is a massive financial burden and parents may not realise the true costs. According to Zhang Jianbai who runs a private school in Yunnan province, parents in small provincial cities often sell their apartments to fund their children's study overseas. "Parents decide very early on that their children are going to go abroad and that requires quite a bit of money because [the preparation] cannot be acquired through the public education system," said Mr Maurer. It can include intensive English lessons, study tours to the US and significant payments for student recruitment agents. Last year an estimated 40,000 Chinese students travelled to Hong Kong to take the US college admissions exam, the Scholastic Assessment Test (SATS), which is not offered in mainland China. Chinese education company, New Oriental Education, organises SAT trips to Hong Kong for $1,000 (£627) on average, and parents spend up to $8,000 (£5,020) on tutoring. Once confined to affluent Beijing and Shanghai, it is an expanding market. The company expects its revenue to grow by over 40% in China's second and third tier cities. "Parents are surrendering their last resources to wager them on a child's future by sending them abroad," said Lao Kaisheng, an education policy researcher at Capital Normal University in Beijing. It means that when young people graduate there is great pressure on them to start earning. This is particularly an issue as record numbers of students graduate, seven million this year, and an overseas degree no longer has the status it had in the past. Many graduates languish in non-graduate jobs. But it is not easy to dampen education fever. In South Korea as in other East Asian countries, "it is deeply embedded in the culture. It's also based on reality that there is no alternative pathway to success or a good career other than a prestige degree, this was true 50 years ago, and it's just as true today". "As long as that's the case it's actually rational for parents to spend so much and put so much pressure on their children," said Prof Seth. </body>

      <body>A school in Bath is reported to have banned pupils from handing out birthday party invitations at school unless the entire class is on the guest list. Father-of-three Ben Milne explores the social minefield of children's parties. It's one of the big questions for parents of small children. Do you invite the whole class to little Harry or Sophie's party, or do you face the fall-out? What the head teacher of Kingswood Prep School in Bath has proposed isn't that revolutionary. At my children's primary school, for instance, the policy is for the child to give their teacher the invitations, which will then be placed discreetly in the invitees' school bags or trays. Nobody feels snubbed, and everybody's happy. What could possibly go wrong with this plan? Oh yes. Children. There you are, waiting for the hordes to arrive, furniture all re-arranged, and party food out on the table. Then your little darling realises they've got a school bag full of invites they've forgotten to give to the teacher. This actually happened to my nephew on his 10th birthday. He was remarkably sanguine about this (the unexpected windfall of unlimited Wotsits seemed to soften the blow somewhat). And if you do invite the whole class, what then? Do you really want your living room used to re-enact Battle Royale with party bags? Or if you want to keep the repair bill down, do you throw large sums of money at the local multiplex or five-a-side pitch? So it's time to whittle down the list. There's the Katie Hopkins method (exclude any child who doesn't share a name with a minor royal) or else there's a process of intense negotiation down from the 200 closest friends your child announces they want to invite, down to the manageable four you had in mind. But is it so bad not being invited to parties? Like a lot of not-very-nice, but survivable things in childhood - not being picked for the team, being blamed for something you didn't do - a snub isn't nice, but it's a small but valuable lesson for the hardships life one day throws at you. As Nietzsche (or was it Kelly Clarkson?) said, "What doesn't kill us, makes us stronger." I don't think he had kids' parties in mind, though.

      <body>As Ofsted inspectors deliver a critical verdict of the education prisoners receive in England's jails, one ex-inmate describes how he finally learnt a vital lesson. Expelled from school at 12, Frank Harris says it was the thought of how he would be remembered by his own children that helped him see education as a way to change his life. The 53-year-old Londoner says he was in and out of prisons for more than 30 years before he found his "way out" through education and wants other people involved in crime to see it is not too late for them either. "I wasn't getting any younger. I was thinking, 'What will my four kids do if I dropped down [dead]?' "If they said I was in and out of prison - that I wasted my time on earth. Now they can say I made mistakes, but I tried to do something different. That pushes me on. "I'm still enjoying my education and still have something to give back." Frank is in the second year of a degree in criminology and criminal justice. He counsels and mentors others who have been involved in crime and has worked with the police on tackling gang culture. But in 2004 he was facing his longest prison stretch ever - four years for smuggling cocaine from Amsterdam - after what he says was a "lifetime of crime". "I knew I'd be coming out, that I needed to do something, to make a change instead of hanging around with people," he said. "I found I enjoyed learning. I had been interested before in lots of things but never had the kind of environment for it to be cool to learn." In prison, he did basic skills lessons before getting A-grades in GCSE English and maths. "People saying well done, that inspired me to say I enjoyed doing this education and it was positive. I saw I could change my life, learning and achieving things. I saw education as a way out and that it could be the key to set me free." After leaving jail, Frank says he was very tempted to go back to his old way of life but instead decided to stay in touch with a charity that had supported him inside - the Prisoners' Education Trust - and the St Giles Trust. "Normally, I was getting picked up by one of my friends [when I got out of jail], and before I got back to London, I would be stoned and wouldn't get home for two days. "The crucial thing this time was there was link. This group had offices you can get in touch with when you get out." Frank says he was on the verge of getting involved with crime again when, he says: "Something told me, 'Don't take the left path, take a right,' and instead, I went down to the offices." He went on take a qualification in counselling to help homeless and vulnerable people and to work for the charity Turning Point. He now counsels others, he says, "to try to stop them taking my path". Like many people in Britain's jails, Frank did badly at school. He had no academic qualifications before studying in prison in his 40s. Expelled at 12, he says he was "delinquent" for 18 months, before being sent to a reform "boarding school", where he says there was no proper teaching. "The classroom was a work room and the teachers - who were really PE teachers - used to say, 'Finish that English off, then you can finish making your chair.' "Boys would be banging about while others were doing written work." Frank says things then went further downhill. "I'd come home every two weeks - my family would not know me, I had no friends. I'd go around by myself and began breaking in to cars, doing rubbish stuff because I was lonely, bored." Shortly after that, Frank says, he began to get custodial sentences for theft and fraud and "that was it for 30 years". He says he was never involved with violent or sexual crimes, but witnessed violence. "People were getting shot in a car next to me; people getting stabbed, but I never picked up a knife in anger. I was smoking crack but I always felt I was on the outside looking in; like I was not meant to be there. "Now I know that reason was to say to young men and women, 'You don't have to go that way - it's such a waste.' I'm here to tell that story. "If you find yourself on the that road, if you are in prison, there's a way out and it's education. "Now I'm a proper father, a proper son, a proper grandfather. I'm stable and I have a family that's stable." </body>

      <title>Corruption and bribery in the classroom</title>
      <description>Bribery and corruption in the classroom</description>

      <body>Corruption in education is a serious blight that undermines the quality and availability of schools and universities around the world, according to an international report. Anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International have published a global survey showing that about one in six students has had to pay a bribe for education services. In parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia this might be requiring parents to pay a fee for a school place that should be free. In Eastern Europe, it might be paying to gain an advantage in university admissions. The Berlin-based campaign group is best known for its annual "global corruption barometer", which measures levels of dishonest payments in more than 100 countries, based on more than 114,000 household interviews. This year's survey also asked questions about people's first-hand experiences and perceptions of dishonesty in education. In some countries these perceptions are distinctively negative. The report says that almost three-quarters of people in Cameroon and Russia see their education systems as "corrupt or highly corrupt". The findings show a huge range of malpractice. In Pakistan, there are warnings of thousands of "shadow schools" without any real students, but drawing public funding to pay for "ghost teachers". "Leakages" in the funding of schools in Kenya had the equivalent value of losing more than 11 million text books, says the report. A study of 180 schools in Tanzania showed that more than a third of intended funds had failed to reach the school. In Greece there are warnings about nepotism in jobs and promotions in higher education. In Vietnam there is a problem with bribery for places in the most sought-after schools. The report quotes figures from the United Nations showing 110 countries where fees are levied, despite in theory having free education enshrined in law. The report describes "myriad pretexts" to impose charges on parents. So why should education be so vulnerable to corruption? Parents want the best for their children, says the report, and they can be exploited by unscrupulous officials controlling access to places. It also involves a great deal of public money filtering down from central government to local school authorities. In Nigeria, the report says, $21m (£13m) intended for schools was lost in two years. But it's not only a problem for the developing world or those providing the basics of schooling. The massive expansion in demand for university education has created rich opportunities for illicit charges. Students need degree-level qualifications more than ever and are under great pressure to get university places and to leave with good grades, opening up fertile territory for corruption and cheating. Eastern European and former Soviet states are highlighted as having had particular difficulties. In Georgia, there have been reforms to stop corruption in university admissions. This hadn't simply been "cash-filled envelopes", but included a complex system of having to buy tutoring, Transparency International found. There could also be more practical types of illicit charges, with suggestions that in Romania access to university accommodation depended on bribery. The demand for qualifications has also generated its own industry in fake universities. In the United States, the report estimates, there are about a thousand "degree mills" in operation, selling bogus qualifications. This isn't only harmless self-delusion, says the report, as these bought qualifications are used to gain graduate jobs, including in one case working in a nuclear power plant. It also highlights the case of Colby Nolan, a student who ostensibly gained an MBA degree in 2004, until his owner revealed that the graduate was a six-year-old cat. He had gained the equivalent of an upper second class degree. The growth of higher education as a globalised, multi-billion dollar business has also spawned a parallel opportunity for fraud, says Philip Altbach, director of the Center for International Higher Education in the Lynch School of Education at Boston College. He has described the "spectre of corruption haunting" the move towards a more internationalised higher education system. And he has called for more co-ordinated international efforts to set standards and share information. The Transparency International study says that corruption has a corrosive effect on education, raising the cost and lowering the quality. "Many people wouldn't realise the extent of corruption in education, right through from the financing of education through to academic corruption," says report editor, Gareth Sweeney. "In some countries it's such a serious problem that it could undermine the credibility of their education systems." There is some good news as the report highlights efforts to tackle bribery. In Chile, anti-corruption lessons have been introduced to the school curriculum and in Bangladesh there is an "integrity pledge" taken by officials. The proliferation of mobile phones in Africa is being used to allow people to expose concerns about bribery in schools. Legal advice centres have also been developed in a number of countries to help community groups make legal challenges against school corruption. There are also international efforts to improve the monitoring and tracking of education funds. But corruption is still there leaching away education budgets. It's a particularly bleak problem when there are still tens of millions of children without any access to school. "Corruption is an obstacle to a fundamental human right to education," says Mr Sweeney. While there are campaigners calling for education for all, such as Malala Yousafzai in Pakistan, this report also warns of the barriers being created for the poorest communities by demands for corrupt payments. Teachers take bribes to offset poor wages or irregular payments and that in turn raises questions about the lack of funding coming from higher up the chain. Mr Sweeney says that there should be a way of measuring good governance in any future global education targets. "Even when formal school fees are abolished, many households are still being forced to pay informal fees. How is a family supposed to be able to afford these costs, when they cannot afford their daily meals?," says Pauline Rose, director of Unesco's Global Monitoring Report, which tracks progress towards primary education for all. "Until these hidden costs are eradicated, we will not be able to call education free, and universal primary education will continue to remain a distant goal for the poorest." </body>

      <title>University boss: Head teacher, mayor or chief executive?</title>
      <description>What does a university vice-chancellor do?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24462298</url>

      <body>Sir David Bell is vice-chancellor of the University of Reading. So what does he do all day? Does it make him a high-powered head teacher, responsible for the university's academic prowess? Or does it make him chief executive of a multi-million pound enterprise, plotting its future business strategy? Sitting in his office at the beginning of a new academic year, it's a reminder of how many big decisions are lying ahead of the UK's university leaders. On the most practical level, he says, it's like running a small town, with its own housing, doctors, libraries, nursery, shops, bars, sports facilities, hundreds of acres of parkland and campus security. There is an ambassadorial role of seeing and being seen. But it's easy to overlook how much universities have grown in terms of local economic significance. It's a long way from being an academic cottage industry. The vice-chancellor in many university towns is now the biggest local employer, apart from the NHS. There are 4,000 people directly employed by Reading University and many more depend on its spending power. The university and its staff and students are worth an estimated £1.78m every single day to the local economy. Universities like Reading were often set up with money from local big businesses - and now they've become the local big spenders themselves. Reading University is a member of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), as well as belonging to academic groups. Even after students finish their courses, the impact continues, with an estimated 19,000 of the university's graduates continuing to live and work in the area. There is an international dimension, as the UK's universities look to expand overseas, not least because of the need for a reliable source of extra income. Reading already has an outpost in South Africa and is planning to open a campus in Malaysia. They decided not to go ahead with plans for China. Sir David, a former Ofsted chief inspector, says the university needs to make plans to offset the volatility of relying on undergraduate student numbers. The word that Sir David uses to describe his responsibilities is "stewardship". The university is heading towards the 100th anniversary of its charter and as the current captain of the ship he wants to make sure it continues safely into the future. He says he "feels the weight" of this legacy and has the words of a previous vice-chancellor on his office wall: "Universities are living things - they feel, think and do." "There's a danger in being purely a chief executive. At the heart, it's about teaching and research," he says. He says he spends as much time as he can with the academics. In terms of running the organisation, there is the weekly equivalent of a cabinet meeting of senior staff. "You sometimes feel vulnerable, you're carrying financial risks. These are big decisions about opening campuses overseas. But you have to make the best decisions at the time with the information available." There is also a responsibility for 17,000 young lives. He says he has been meeting and greeting new arrivals at the university. Watching parents saying goodbye to their children has brought home to him the importance of this moment. "This is a big deal. We've got to look after them. It's often their first experience away from home." The funding of universities is increasingly dependent on attracting undergraduates and their tuition fees. And the unpredictability is a problem for long-term planning. "I can't imagine there's a vice-chancellor in the land who isn't thinking about it." It raises questions about how mainstream, provincial universities, with a tradition of doing a bit of everything, can make themselves distinctive. Not just compared with other UK universities but also international rivals. The emergence of online university courses - so-called Moocs - makes the powerhouses of US universities only a mouse click away. The uncertainty over undergraduate numbers has given universities an incentive to find other sources of income, such as shifting towards graduate courses and executive training. The Henley Business School, a slice of the City on the Reading campus, has its own mock trading rooms. Postgraduates are now 45% of the students on Reading's campus. But how should a modern university present itself? Is it meant to be clad in ivy or silicon? On a warm autumn afternoon, the Reading campus looks like something from an American college movie, with youngsters practising American football on leafy sports fields. It's a long way from roll-up cigarettes and Oxfam overcoats. There has been a surge of new university buildings to attract young students. In Reading they've put £400m into new accommodation. Sir David says universities have had to respond to "changing patterns of affluence and what young people expect". "I don't take too precious a view of that." But if universities spend too much, they can be accused of being cash rich. When earlier this year the university bought a unique Samuel Beckett manuscript to add to its archive there was some carping about the price tag of £962,500. A US university would have told everyone it cost twice as much and put it all over the website to show they were serious players. Sir David says that despite the upheavals in funding and technology and the push towards a more competitive system he expects more to stay the same than will change. "We're in turbulent times," he says, but remains confident that the university will still be recognisable in two decades. "There is something powerful in having great seats of learning." </body>

      <title>Owner of killer dogs avoids jail</title>
      <description>A sentencing hearing for a woman who caused suffering to four dogs that killed a teenager is told of the "horrific" attack scene found by police.</description>

      <body>The moment a policeman found a girl who had been mauled to death by four dogs was the most distressing sight of his life, a court has heard. Jade Anderson, 14, died on 26 March at the house in Atherton, near Wigan. Magistrates heard PC Martin Burkinshaw would "never forget" encountering a bull mastiff-type dog covered in blood. Speaking after the sentencing of dog owner Beverley Concannon, Jade's family said they were "disgusted" she had walked free with a suspended sentence. At Wigan Magistrates Court, 45-year-old Concannon was given a 16-week suspended jail term after admitting causing suffering to the four animals. Jade had been at Concannon's house in Chaucer Grove visiting a teenage friend. The judge said Concannon, who was out of the house when Jade was attacked, should have been aware of her dogs' aggression. In September, the Crown Prosecution Service ruled there was "insufficient evidence" to bring a charge of manslaughter by gross negligence against Concannon. It was also not possible to bring charges under the Dangerous Dogs Act because her animals were not banned breeds and were not out of control in a public place. Jade's mother and stepfather have campaigned for the government to tighten the laws around dangerous animal ownership. They want dog owners who fail to stop their pet attacking someone to be liable to prosecution. Speaking after Concannon's sentencing, Jade's stepfather Michael Anderson said: "I'm devastated and disgusted in the justice system. "Today was just about dangerous dogs. I think she should be held responsible for Jade. "We have got a life sentence. It has absolutely ripped us apart." During the sentencing hearing, Paul Taylor, prosecuting, read a statement from PC Burkinshaw about how the officer found Jade's body in the kitchen and all four dogs at the back door trying to get in. The statement said: "The sound of the dogs in the backyard was horrific. "I will never forget what I saw. There was a large white bull mastiff-type dog. "Its head and mouth were covered in fresh blood and it was bounding in the back yard." The hearing was told how one dog, Buddy, an American bulldog, was "stir crazy". It was kept in a cage as punishment and was not walked or trained, the court was told. The dogs were put down after the attack on Jade. District Judge Mark Hadfield told Concannon her treatment of the dogs had contributed to their state. He ordered her to pay costs and a victim surcharge totalling £165 and banned her from keeping dogs indefinitely. </body>

      <title>Death home saw 'institutional abuse'</title>
      <description>Institutionalised abuse took place at Orchid View, the Crawley care home that saw 19 unexplained deaths, a coroner says.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-24579496</url>

      <body>A care home where 19 residents died was riddled with "institutionalised abuse", a coroner has said. Penelope Schofield has ruled neglect contributed to five of the deaths, at Orchid View in Copthorne, near Crawley. The West Sussex coroner said the home, then run by Southern Cross, was "mismanaged and understaffed". Ms Schofield has also criticised the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which gave the home a "good" rating in 2010, a year before it closed down. A serious case review has now begun into the elderly residents' deaths. At the final day of a five-week inquest into the deaths, which were all "unexplained", Mrs Schofield said the problems at the home were from the top down and started at an early stage, but nobody did anything to address them. Orchid View has since reopened under a new name and new management. Ms Schofield said it was "disgraceful" Southern Cross was allowed to run the home in the way it was, for about two years. Referring to the CQC's rating of the home, she said: "I question how this could be the case and I question whether the inspection that did take place was fit for purpose. "It's a heartbreaking case. We all have parents who will probably need care in the latter part of their lives." Andrea Sutcliffe, the CQC's chief inspector of adult social care, said she had ordered a "root-and-branch review" of the organisation's actions in relation to Orchid View. While summing up, Ms Schofield said she had found that medical documents for resident Jean Halfpenny, 77, were falsified and that she was given too much of the blood-thinning drug warfarin. Home manager Meera Reed had earlier denied ordering staff to shred documents and filling in new forms to cover up the overdose. Continuing, the coroner said that another resident was found naked and in pain with his catheter twisted, while a family member found staff eating toast and drinking tea with their feet up. Whistleblower Lisa Martin, who first informed police of problems at Orchid View, said she felt she had no choice but to come forward. Speaking outside the inquest, she said: "I had witnessed too much poor management and care to vulnerable adults. "I couldn't live with the knowledge any longer and felt I had no choice but to tell the police." She said she knew she had done the right thing morally, but said she had not worked for two years and the case had had a huge impact on her life. Speaking of her former colleagues, she said: "They shouldn't be allowed to work in the industry." During the inquest, the coroner also said it was a cause for concern that many people who worked at Orchid View were still working in the industry. Ms Martin said when Mrs Halfpenny had to be admitted to hospital, Ms Reed looked at her forms and said: "We can't send her to hospital with those. They will shut us down." She said other forms were filled out and she was asked not to disclose the shredding of the original documents to anyone. She added that the final straw came when she was told by a nurse they had found 28 drug errors from just one night shift. She called the police who arrived the next day. Ms Schofield said that all 19 residents whose deaths were unexplained had suffered "sub-optimal" care. She said they had all died of natural causes but the deaths of 86-year-old Enid Trodden, 85-year-olds Wilfred Gardner and John Holmes, and 77-year-olds Margaret Tucker and Jean Halfpenny "had been attributed to by neglect". After the hearing, Mrs Halfpenny's daughter, Linzi Collings, said the horrific details that had emerged were beyond comprehension. She said: "How the corporate failings of Southern Cross could create these events and how such terrible standards could go unnoticed by the authorities for so long has left us baffled." She said her mother deserved to be treated with dignity and compassion, but Orchid View failed to provide her with even basic care, despite being paid a significant amount of money. Lawyers for some families have called for a public inquiry to be set up, but the coroner said she would await the outcome of the serious case review first. Ian Christian, of Irwin Mitchell solicitors, which represented seven families, said the situation at Orchid View raised questions about the quality of care provided across the industry. He said before Southern Cross closed, it had owned 752 care homes. "The evidence revealed in this inquest is deeply concerning as it shows signs of profits being put before the well-being of residents," he said. Amanda Rogers, director of adult services for West Sussex County Council, said the inquest showed a shocking example of poor care, but such examples were "isolated" and the public should "remain confident" about the levels of care in West Sussex. The CQC's Ms Sutcliffe said she was shocked at the descriptions of care at Orchid View in 2010 and 2011. She said it was "completely unacceptable" and lessons needed to be learned. She added that she would "personally oversee a root-and-branch review of our actions". Ms Sutcliffe said she had already outlined changes to how care homes would inspected, monitored and regulated in the future. </body>

      <title>Loneliness affects 'half of adults'</title>
      <description>Almost half of all adults in England say they experience feelings of loneliness, according to the results of a BBC poll.</description>

      <body>Almost half of all adults in England say they experience feelings of loneliness, according to a BBC poll. Commissioned as part of the Faith In The World Week, the survey showed that 48% of adults feel varying degrees of loneliness. It also showed that people who practise a religion feel lonelier than those who do not. London is said to be the loneliest place with a figure of 52% compared to 45% in the South West of England. The survey, which was carried out by polling company ComRes on behalf of Radio 2 and BBC Local Radio, also showed: On Friday, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said society had "utterly failed" to confront the problem of loneliness. He quoted figures from the Campaign to End Loneliness that suggested 800,000 people were chronically lonely in England. Mervyn Kohler, a special adviser for Age UK, said he was not surprised by the results and believed that loneliness was a "serious problem". "We find fairly horrifying the number of elderly people who feel the TV is their best friend," he said. "Loneliness is on the increase for a variety of reasons, mostly because of the changing nature of society with families becoming split up as children move away." So-called befriending schemes have become one way in which those experiencing loneliness try to meet others. Liliane Mitchell said she suffered from loneliness when she moved to a new town, split up with her husband and was diagnosed with cancer all in a relatively short period of time. She said: "Post-treatment we had a very severe winter and I was very poorly and housebound for three days. "I thought, 'I don't believe this is happening to me, I'm on my own - totally on my own'." She then joined a befriending scheme. "They become friends, but it's different I think, because they want to be there and they want to help you," she said. Homelessness can also lead to people feeling lonely and detached from society. Matthew Fowler, 26, lives and works at the Emmaus Community, in Brighton, which helps homeless people. "The loneliest I've felt would have been in the daytime when people are going about their business on their lunch breaks and work - going on living their lives - and I'm basically strolling the streets. "That makes me feel really lonely and really detached from society." Mr Kohler, from Age UK, said schemes which aim to help tackle loneliness have come under financial pressure in the current economic climate. He said."Austerity undoubtedly has had an effect. "In the context of public sector cuts, community centres and other publicly-owned meeting places are struggling to exist." He said the problem needed to be tackled by "rekindling some of the local community glue that we can see operating in rural areas". "However, I think the elderly population also have to change their attitudes and approach to this," he said. "They have to make sure that they are joining in with local community activities and have a grip of modern technology to be able to communicate." </body>

      <title>Hunt highlights plight of the lonely</title>

      <body>It is a source of "national shame" that as many as 800,000 people in England are "chronically lonely", Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. In a speech, Mr Hunt highlighted the "problem of loneliness that in our busy lives we have utterly failed to confront as a society". "Some five million people say television is their main form of company," he said. Labour accused of him trying to blame families for government failures. In a speech at the National Children and Adults Services (NCAS) conference, Mr Hunt said: "Each and every lonely person has someone who could visit them and offer companionship. "A forgotten million who live amongst us - ignored to our national shame." He added: "According to the Campaign to End Loneliness, there are 800,000 people in England who are chronically lonely." He also told delegates that the 112,000 cases of alleged abuse in care homes referred by English councils in 2012-13, the majority involving over-65s, indicated that "something is badly wrong". But the regulation of care in both the private and public sector was improving, he argued. The Conservative MP said the new chief inspector of social care, Andrea Sutcliffe, would start to give ratings to care homes from April 2014, with a view to organising inspections of all 25,000 care homes by 2016. Mr Hunt said he was "particularly worried" about the 400,000 people in care homes - some of whom get regular visits, but others who were just "parked there". He said that 46% of people aged 80 or over reported feeling lonely "some of the time or often". He warned that loneliness was as "bad for you" as "smoking 15 cigarettes a day", was "worse than obesity" because of the risk of blood clots, heart disease and dementia, and warned that lonely people "drink more" and are more prone to early admission in residential or nursing care. Mr Hunt also said he believed the UK should learn from Asian cultures, where there was "reverence and respect for older people" and "residential care is a last rather than a first option". "The social contract is stronger because as children see how their own grandparents are looked after, they develop higher expectations of how they too will be treated when they get old," he explained. "If we are to tackle the challenge of an ageing society, we must learn from this - and restore and reinvigorate the social contract between generations. "And uncomfortable though it is to say it, it will only start with changes in the way we personally treat our own parents and grandparents." England should aim to become "the best place in the world to grow old in", he concluded. But Labour said the "real national shame" was "Jeremy Hunt's attempt to shift the blame for dealing with the very real problems of loneliness amongst elderly people on to families alone". Shadow health and social care minister Liz Kendall said: "He seems completely unaware that there are over six million unpaid family carers in Britain today, one in five of whom provide more than 50 hours care a week for their loved ones. "These unsung heroes save the taxpayer billions of pounds yet often get precious little support in return. "Families, friends and neighbours need a decent care system to back up their efforts to look after elderly people, but the reality is our care system is in crisis and has been pushed to the brink of collapse. "Jeremy Hunt and David Cameron need to take responsibly for their government's actions rather than trying to turn the clock back and say it's down to families alone." Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said on Twitter that Jeremy Hunt was "right to highlight isolation of older people". He added: "But he can't get away from fact that Govt cuts to care have made it much worse." But speaking on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Anthea Tinker, professor of social gerontology at King's College in London, said it was a "myth" that eastern Asian families placed greater reverence on families and older people than in the West. "The reality is that with one-child-families, children have often moved to a city or emigrated," she said. "So it's just not practical for families to depend on their children. One of the largest nursing homes in the world is about to open in China, for 5,000 people, which is amazing." Prof Tinker added: "We've got to look at the reality rather than the myth." </body>

      <title>Taxpayers to fund Richard III row</title>
      <description>Distant relatives of Richard III are told they will have their costs protected even if they lose a legal battle over where the monarch's remains should be reburied.</description>

      <body>Distant relatives of Richard III will have their costs protected even if they lose a legal battle over where the monarch's remains should be reburied. The Plantagenet Alliance favours reburial in York and has won a judicial review challenging a decision to re-inter the king's bones in Leicester. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling argued in the High Court that taxpayers should not foot the bill for the review. But a judge has ruled the Alliance can have a protective costs order (PCO). Mr Justice Haddon-Cave ruled that he was satisfied that "it was, and is, appropriate, to grant a full PCO". A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: "It is unfair for taxpayers to have to fund the case being brought by the Plantagenet Alliance and we are disappointed by the court's decision on this issue. "We will now consider the judgment on this appeal and decide our next steps. "We will continue to vigorously defend our position at the main judicial review hearing. Richard's skeletal remains were discovered buried under a council car park in Leicester last year and the plan is for them to be re-interred at the city's cathedral. But the relatives claim it was the king's wish to be buried at York and have launched what the judge has described as "Wars of the Roses Part II". The Alliance is seeking a High Court judicial review and accuses the justice secretary of failing to consult properly before giving archaeologists from the University of Leicester licence to excavate and to decide where the bones should be reburied. The judge observed: "It seems that this case will be hard fought, despite entreaties, with no quarter being given on either side". </body>

      <body>The body of a four-year-old boy who was starved to death by his mother has been released for burial, nearly four years after he died. Hamzah Khan's mummified corpse was found in Bradford in 2011, almost two years after his death in December 2009. His body was released by a coroner who told his father Aftab Khan he could now "lay his son to rest". Amanda Hutton, 43, was convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence and jailed for 15 years earlier this month. During a 10-minute hearing, Coroner Professor Paul Marks told the inquest "all the relevant facts had already been ventilated via [Hutton's] court case". He then heard a summary of events from Det Insp Ian Lawrie, of West Yorkshire Police, and reviewed the evidence of medical experts before releasing the body. Turning to Mr Khan he said: "You will now be able to lay your son to rest." Alcoholic mother-of-eight Hutton also pleaded guilty to the neglect of Hamzah's five siblings, who also lived at the house and were aged between five and 13, and preventing the burial of Hamzah's body. Hutton's eldest son, Tariq Khan, 24, also admitted preventing Hamzah's burial and received a two-year jail sentence, suspended for two years. </body>

      <body>A planned five-hour strike by firefighters in England and Wales has been called off, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has said. The union said the decision came after progress in talks over pensions - the strike had been due to take place from 18:30 until 23:30 BST on Saturday. The government wants firefighters to work up to 60 but the union says this is too old to be fighting fires. The FBU said it had been presented with a deal similar to that in Scotland. This means firefighters will be able to retire on a full pension between the the ages of 55 and 60 if they are genuinely not fit enough and another role cannot be found for them. A member of staff who does meet the fitness standards and chooses to retire early will get a reduced pension. A final agreement has not yet been reached because negotiations will need to take place between ministers and individual fire authorities about how this will be funded. Firefighters in Scotland voted against a strike. The FBU said 32,000 union members in England and Wales walked out for four hours when it staged a first round of action last month. Contingency plans at the 46 fire services in England and three in Wales included using part-time and volunteer firefighters, calling in non-union fire crews and bringing in private contractors. The armed forces had a back-up role and in the event of a major incident union members could have returned to work. No major incidents were reported during the strike which was the first national walkout for a decade. </body>

      <title>Fresh barracks death inquest call</title>
      <description>Calls are made for a fresh inquest into the 1995 death of an Army recruit from Denbighshire, one of four at the Surrey barracks within seven years.</description>

      <body>Calls have been made by a human rights group for a fresh inquest into the death of an 18-year-old Army recruit from Denbighshire. Liberty is representing the parents of Cheryl James, from Llangollen, who died in November 1995 at Deepcut barracks in Surrey. She was one of four soldiers who died there between 1995 and 2002, sparking allegations of bullying and abuse. The attorney general's office said it was considering the application. Pte Sean Benton, 20, from Hastings, East Sussex, was found dead with gunshot wounds at the barracks in June 1995, just months before Pte James's death, also from gunshot wounds. In September 2001, 17-year-old Pte Geoff Gray, from Seaham, Co Durham, was found with two gunshot wounds to his head, and six months later, Pte James Collinson, from Perth, also 17, was found with a single gunshot wound upwards through his chin. A Surrey Police investigation was launched into the deaths in 2002, following pressure from the families who rejected suggestions the soldiers had committed suicide and called for a public inquiry. Later, a report by the Adult Learning Inspectorate, commissioned by the armed forces minister called for substantial reforms in the training of new recruits. A later investigation by deputy high court judge Nicholas Blake QC called for an independent ombudsman for the armed forces, but rejected the families' calls for a public inquiry. It also concluded that Ptes Gray, James and Benton had committed suicide. An inquest into Pte James' death held shortly after it happened recorded an open verdict. On Friday, Liberty announced it is applying for a fresh inquest into Pte James' death and will soon be doing the same on behalf of the parents of Pte Benton. The group said its application to the attorney general comes after using the Human Rights Act to get access to documentation about Pte James' death that her family have never seen, claiming 44 volumes of statements, documents, notes and photographs contain evidence that has never before been properly examined and suggesting witnesses may have lied. A fresh inquest can be ordered if there is evidence of fraud, irregularity of proceedings, insufficiency of inquiry or new evidence. If the attorney general gives his consent, the matter will be referred to the High Court for consideration, Liberty said. Legal officer Emma Norton said: "Cheryl's grieving family have been consistently snubbed by the state in their quest to discover what really happened to their daughter - only a fresh inquest can deliver the truth they so deserve. "The human rights of our troops are worthy of exactly the same protection as everyone else - until what happened to these young people at Deepcut is competently, calmly and independently investigated, justice will not be done". Pte James' parents Des and Doreen James added: "We're disappointed it has taken close to 18 years for us to even get disclosure of the evidence related to Cheryl's premature death. "No family should ever have to go through what we've experienced, and the fact there still has never been any meaningful inquiry into the four deaths at Deepcut remains a stain on the integrity of everyone involved. "All four were placed in the care of the state and all four were badly let down. "The implications of the new evidence is both serious and extremely worrying for us but we have every confidence in Liberty and our entire legal team." A spokeswoman for the attorney general's office confirmed that it had received an application from Liberty seeking the attorney general's consent to apply for a new inquest into Pte James' death, and it was being considered. </body>

      <body>West Mercia Police is conducting a review of its investigation into a meeting between Andrew Mitchell MP and Police Federation representatives. Three senior officers have been accused of trying to discredit the former Tory chief whip. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has said there was a misconduct case to answer. The chief constables of West Mercia, Warwickshire and West Midlands Police are due to appear before MPs. They have all declined to comment ahead of their appearance before the Home Affairs Select Committee (HASC) on Wednesday. A meeting was held after a row between police officers and Mr Mitchell over words he used when he was stopped from riding a bicycle through the Downing Street gates, in September last year. A transcript of the meeting showed that, while he admitted swearing, Mr Mitchell denied using the word "pleb" or insulting the police. But afterwards three senior police officers said he had refused to elaborate on what had happened and should resign. On Tuesday, the IPCC questioned the "honesty and integrity" of the officers, and said West Mercia Police had been wrong to conclude they had no case to answer for misconduct. The Police and Crime Commissioner for Warwickshire, Ron Ball, called for West Mercia Police to conduct a review of its investigation into the specific issues raised in the IPCC's latest letter. Mr Ball said: "The media have interpreted the content of the IPCC letter alleging that senior officers intervened to change the outcome of the investigation. "Specifically, that the report had been changed from 'Case to answer' to 'No case to answer'. "That is a very serious allegation and I want to understand the exact circumstances of the investigative approval process." In a statement the Chief Constable of West Mercia Police, David Shaw, said work was being carried out to clarify the issues raised in the IPCC letter. A spokesman from the force said it was seeking legal advice as to whether the investigation will be available to the public. Association of Chief Police Officers' chairman Sir Hugh Orde has said the incident demonstrated the "critical" need for a fully independent police investigation system. </body>

      <body>Police are trying to trace a 12-year-old boy they believe suffered an attempted rape in the men's toilets at a shopping centre. A 68-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted rape following the alleged incident at Manchester Arndale Centre on Thursday. Police received reports of a man approaching the schoolboy at 16:50 BST. But the child left the centre before police arrived, and attempts are now being made to find him. Det Sgt Mark Tiffany, from the Serious Sexual Offences Unit, said: "We do not have a clear picture of what happened as we have not been able to speak to the boy. "We are urging him to come forward and speak to police in confidence so that we can find out what happened and get him any help and support he needs." In a separate case in June, two men were jailed for approaching a boy in the Arndale Centre and raping him in a nearby Debenhams. </body>

Judge Mary Mowat lifted reporting restrictions around Mr Dilsoz, from Oxford, after hearing he had absconded from his home address. Ghausel Tarakhail, 19, and Iztullah Qudrat, 18, also from Oxford, face charges of sexual activity with the alleged victim between May and July. Det Con Matthew Hodgetts said: "It is believed Mr Dilsoz may still be in the Oxford area but there is a possibility he is now further afield. "I would urge anyone who knows where he is or has information about his recent whereabouts to come forward." Mr Tarakhail, of Cowley Road, pleaded not guilty to engaging in sexual activity when he appeared in court and was remanded in custody. He is expected to stand trial on 13 January. Mr Qudrat and Mr Dilsoz, both from Headington, will appear in court on 1 November. </body>

      <body>A once-prominent member of the English Defence League (EDL) has been jailed after he went on the run following a violent attempted robbery. Guramit Singh Kalirai, 31, of Ullswater Crescent in Bramcote, Nottingham, did not turn up to his trial in September. He was found guilty in his absence and sentenced to six-and-a-half years. His two accomplices were jailed. Appearing at Nottingham Crown Court on Friday, he was sentenced to a further nine months for breaching his bail. Kalirai, who was previously a spokesman for the EDL, was arrested earlier this month in Long Eaton. During his trial, the jury heard Kalirai and his two accomplices, Andrew Wheelhouse, from Alfreton, Derbyshire, and David Mura, of Stapleford, Nottinghamshire, had raided a shop in May this year. The three men pinned the shop assistant to the ground and made threats to slash his throat if he did not hand over cash. Workers at a neighbouring business who heard shouts called the police and managed to stop one of the men escaping before officers arrived. They were praised by detectives for their "quick thinking and brave assistance" for helping to thwart the robbery. </body>

      <title>Woman jailed for 900 handbags theft</title>
      <description>A woman who stole more than 900 designer handbags worth up to £135,000 and sold them on eBay is jailed for 18 months.</description>

      <body>A 48-year-old woman who stole 905 designer handbags over a three-year period has been jailed for 18 months. Jayne Rand, from Swindon in Wiltshire, carried out a nationwide "campaign of shoplifting" and took handbags and purses worth up to £135,000. She was eventually caught at a shopping centre in Cwmbran, south Wales. Her haul, Newport Crown Court heard, included bags made by Mulberry, Prada, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Dior and Burberry valued at up to £200 each. Rand sold some of the bags on online auction site eBay. She is known to have made £88,000 in sales from the stolen bags but their retail value would have been closer to double that figure. On Friday, Judge Rhys Rowlands told her she had "made a business of stealing" and her actions had been "planned, calculated and persistent". "I have not seen such a case before. You travelled significant distances to steal from up and down the country and target high value bags," the judge added. The court heard how Rand, a housewife and mother of two, was able to carry out her crimes and even stole to order for some of her online buyers. Prosecutor David Wooler said: "She stole handbags from all over the country. "She targeted department stores including Debenhams, House of Fraser and John Lewis. "Her usual method of theft was to go into the store without a bag, pick up one from the display, walk around with it on her shoulder for a while, then simply walk out of the store. "Sometimes she would have to remove the security tag, but usually she wouldn't have to." But her crime spree came to an end when security staff at a shopping centre in Cwmbran caught her and alerted police. The court heard after officers began to investigate they found she had listed a significant number of handbags for sale on eBay priced competitively. "Her house was full of sealable grey delivery bags and Post Office receipts," the prosecutor told the court. "She set up a legitimate business and no one, not even her husband, knew what she was doing. "Rand told police she needed money to fund her lifestyle." She admitted stealing 905 handbags and four purses from House of Fraser and various retail businesses between December 2009 and December 2012. She also admitted converting criminal assets from 838 handbags. The court was told the cost price of the handbags was in excess of £130,000 but the prosecutor said the retail price would be much greater. In her defence, Andrew Taylor, said: "She bitterly regrets everything that she's done." "She became almost immune to the feeling of wrongdoing. "She was almost addicted to stealing high-value bags in an attempt to keep the ship afloat. "She never expected to find herself in such dire circumstances and out of desperation took this course of action." During sentencing, Judge Rhys Rowlands told Rand: "This was a remarkably serious raft of thefts which only ended when you were caught stealing a valuable handbag from a store in Cwmbran. "How you got away with it for so long without being caught was deeply remarkable. "You showed professionalism and that is why you went undetected for so long. "You travelled the country with the sole purpose of theft and you made a successful albeit dishonest business of selling stolen handbags. "The values are quite outside of what the court comes across even from professional shoplifting gangs. "It's sad and unusual to see a woman of 48 with previous good character up before the court for such a protracted and serious dishonesty. "Many, many businesses get into difficulty but most behave honestly and do not turn to this sort of crime." PC Rhodri Parry, from Gwent Police, said: "Crimes against retailers impact all of the community as it has the effect of making goods more expensive for everyone else. "We are pleased that the individual responsible for a sustained series of thefts from local retailers and those further afield has now been sentenced for her crimes. She will now be subject to a proceeds of crime inquiry." A House of Fraser spokesperson said Rand's behaviour "impacted a number of retailers across the UK". "We commend the vigilance of our Cwmbran store team who identified the woman as acting suspiciously, acted promptly and were supported by the police with her arrest," the spokesperson added. </body>

      <body>A two-year-old girl died and a number of children were rescued following a house fire in South Yorkshire. Fire crews were called to a house in Conisbrough, near Doncaster, just before 20:00 BST on Thursday after a neighbour raised the alarm. The girl was rescued from a bedroom window by firefighters and taken to hospital, but died from her injuries. South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said the fire happened in an upstairs bedroom in the house on Don Street. A spokesman for South Yorkshire Police said: "A two-year-old girl was taken to hospital where, sadly, she died from her injuries. "Police believe that no-one else was injured during the incident and inquiries are ongoing to establish the exact circumstances around the fire." Fire investigators at the scene said they were "keeping an open mind as to the cause of the fire." Steve Green from South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said "it does not appear there were smoke alarms in the premises". He added that neighbours had attempted to enter the house to help but were "unsuccessful". Flowers and other tributes have been laid near the police cordon. One neighbour said the dead girl would be "really missed". "A lovely, lovely family," she said. "Saying hello every morning every time they went past, waving. "The little girl was a little diamond. She loved to play with all the little kids up at toddler group. "Our prayers are out for all the family." </body>

      <body>A tattooed Maori preserved head and skeletal remains are being returned from Birmingham to New Zealand. The ancestral items were discovered in the anatomy department at the University of Birmingham. Staff contacted the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa about the remains, which had been in storage. A traditional funeral ceremony was held at the university and the remains were given to Maori delegates for their return to Wellington. Arapata Hakiwai, co-leader of the New Zealand museum, said the ceremony was important "for the elders to tell the ancestors they're going to journey home soon". Te Herekiekie Herewini, manager of the repatriation programme, said: "In our beliefs your spirit and life force comes from the particular part of the country you're from. "It's important for your life force to go back to that place. Repatriation allows both sides to reconcile their histories." University staff said the toi moko (preserved head) and koiwi tangata (skeletal remains) had not been used or displayed and their presence at the university was a mystery. Dr June Jones, from the College of Medical and Dental Sciences, said: "We have no records about how these items came to be in storage at the university, but when they were uncovered we knew we had to give them back. "We believe that to keep them would be wrong. "They belong back with their own people, to be treated with the dignity and respect they deserve." She apologised directly to the Maori delegates and said the paperwork that accompanied the items was believed to have gone missing during renovations at the medical building over the last century. "It's most likely from Victorian times when we had a lot of wealthy people in Birmingham. Collecting heads was an activity, a hobby, for some men. "Relatives, when they realised they were skulls, maybe gave them to the medical school." She described the collecting of remains from other cultures as an "example of one historical practice we're deeply ashamed of". The handover was arranged as part of the museum's repatriation programme, which has managed the return of more than 100 items since 2003. It said more than 400 items were believed to still be in the UK, based on records kept by museums and other sources. In total, eight toi moko and five koiwi tangata will be collected from institutions in the UK and Ireland this month. After they have arrived in Wellington to a ceremonial welcome, researchers will try to ascertain their place of origin so they can be returned. </body>

      <title>Conker 'lessons' permission sought</title>
      <description>Teachers carry out a risk assessment, seek allergy advice and ask parents' permission before teaching primary school children how to play conkers.</description>

      <body>A Cambridgeshire head teacher wrote to parents for permission to teach their children to play conkers, after realising 95% of them did not know how. John Cattermole, from Littleport Primary, said he had to carry out a risk assessment and check the game was safe for nut allergy sufferers first. Conkers is not banned in schools, but some have chosen not to allow the game citing health and safety concerns. Mr Cattermole said parents were "very supportive" and the children loved it. He said he was inspired to introduce the game after seeing children looking at conkers on the ground, but not knowing what to do with them. "We showed them how to play during assembly, which is when I realised about 95% of them had never had a game of conkers in their life," he said. In the letter to parents, Mr Cattermole wrote: "We believe [conkers] is a fun, healthy game to play. It is also good for hand/eye co-ordination and gets children talking about maths and numbers as they play. "Mr Rivett and I have been showing children how to play safely in assembly today. "We have been in touch with the Anaphylaxis Association, as we have children at school with nut allergies. They have said there is no need to worry about conkers being on a school site." Parents were asked to fill in a slip at the foot of the letter if they did not wish their children to play conkers. Mr Cattermole said the school had received "many, many supportive emails" after sending the letter and said not one of the 416 pupils' parents objected. "Educationally, playing conkers has got the children talking about numbers and counting in the playground - but really it's just fun," he said. </body>

      <title>Fan misses first home game since '76</title>

      <body>A football fan's record of not missing a home game since 1976 is ending this weekend. Wolves fan Peter Abbott, from Ipswich, will not be at Molineux for Saturday's match against Coventry because he will be at his stepdaughter's wedding. Mr Abbott, who has a regular 330 mile (530km) round trip to Wolverhampton, said he was gutted when he realised. "I've been getting my head round it for eight months, but I'm past that now," he said. Mr Abbott, 56, grew up in east London and said he fell for Wolves via the television and magazines and first saw them at West Ham in 1970, when they lost 3-0. He regularly started going to Molineux in the 1975-76 season and the last game he missed there was against Tottenham on 16 March 1976, which Wanderers lost 1-0. He said he has seen 1,902 home and away matches since then and only missed one (at Blackburn in 1985, when Wolves lost 3-0) and that was because his train broke down. "I wondered if the Coventry fixture would change for television, but as it was getting nearer the date I realised that wasn't going to happen and, unless there's an unbelievable weather occurrence, the match will go ahead without me," he said. "It's quite clearly Sarah and Jonno's day and I'm happy for them and I'm falling in line with that." He said he would not be attempting to listen to any commentary during the service, where Sarah Butler will marry Jonathan Liddle, and which starts at 14:00 BST at Haughley near Stowmarket, but he would try to stay informed by texts after the 15:00 kick-off. Mr Abbot said the three Vauxhall Astras he has owned in the past 20 years have each clocked up more than 330,000 miles for football, work and other pleasures. He said he would be "back in the saddle" for Wolves's home game against Oldham on 22 October. </body>

      <title>Hodgson joke a compliment - Townsend</title>
      <description>England winger Andros Townsend describes the joke Roy Hodgson told that prompted a race row as a "compliment".</description>

      <body>Andros Townsend has described Roy Hodgson's comment that prompted a race row as a "compliment". England boss Hodgson was criticised for referring to a joke about a monkey and an astronaut at half-time in Tuesday's World Cup qualifier against Poland. Hodgson was trying to encourage right-back Chris Smalling to pass to Townsend, 22, more often. "The manager just told the players to give the ball to me so that's a compliment," said the Tottenham winger. "Everyone should be focusing on England qualifying for Brazil - not on negative silly news." The joke, the exact wording of which is still unclear, revolves around an astronaut and a monkey on a space mission. The monkey performs all the tasks requested by mission control, with the punchline being that the astronaut's only role is to feed the monkey. It came during Townsend's second game for England, after he had scored on his debut in the 4-1 win over Montenegro. "It's a dream come true to play for your country," said Townsend, who was speaking to BBC Sport news correspondent Natalie Pirks at a Spurs event to highlight breast cancer awareness.  "I had the perfect debut really, scoring a goal and getting man of the match, but I couldn't let it get to me or get big-headed as we had to concentrate on the next game. "It's only now after the games are done that I've realised how big it was for the country." Hodgson said on Friday that he and the players were angry that the race row had overshadowed England's achievement in qualifying for the World Cup in Brazil next year. "Joy is short-lived in this job," he told the Daily Mail.  "The players are as angry about this as I am. "We have just had a successful period and, although I wouldn't suggest we intend to rest on our laurels, I think we have earned the right to enjoy the fruits of our labours. Instead we get this." Former Southampton and England forward Matthew Le Tissier says he is disturbed that there is somebody in the dressing room that Hodgson cannot trust. "That's not a great thing to have," Le Tissier told BBC Sport. "If the player is offended then pull Roy to one side and be a man about it. Roy is the type of guy who will have gone 'I didn't really mean any offence and I apologise'. "That would have been the end of the matter." Anti-racism campaigners Kick It Out had called for the Football Association to investigate the comments, but it considered the matter closed on Thursday after the governing body released a statement in support of Hodgson. "Roy Hodgson is a man of the highest integrity, an honourable man who is doing a great job with the England team," said FA chairman Greg Dyke. "He has fully explained to us what he said and the point he was making to the players in the dressing room at half-time on Tuesday night. He has also explained the context in which he made his remarks." However, another campaign group has sent a formal complaint to the FA in which it calls for an independent investigation into the issue. In the four-page complaint, Race for Sport, an off-shoot of the Society for Black Lawyers, says the decision to consider the matter closed is "unacceptable". It also demands "cultural intelligence" training for Hodgson and all football managers. England striker Wayne Rooney showed his support for 66-year-old Hodgson on Twitter   and via his personal website.  "To try and pin some form of label on him is absolutely ridiculous," he said. "Roy spoke to Andros straight away and he took no offence whatsoever. Hopefully that's now the end of the matter." </body>

      <title>Kerrigan one of 15 new Lancs deals</title>
      <description>England spinner Simon Kerrigan is among 15 Lancashire players to agree new contracts with the Division Two champions.</description>

      <body>England's Simon Kerrigan has signed a new two-year contract with Lancashire. The spinner, 24, took 58 first-class wickets last season as Lancashire won Division Two and made his Test debut in the summer's final Ashes match. He is among 15 to sign new deals along with captain Glen Chapple, Tom Smith, Karl Brown, Paul Horton and Kyle Hogg. Andrea Agathangelou, Stephen Parry, Liam Livingstone, Oliver Newby, Jordan Clark, Alex Davies, Arron Lilley, Luke Procter, and Luis Reece are the others. "It's great that all 15 players, except Andrea, are products of our system," said cricket director Mike Watkinson. "That is a great endorsement of the strength and effectiveness of the cricket played across the county." Brown, Hogg, Parry, Horton, Reece and Smith have all committed for a further two seasons whilst Chapple, who will be 40 at the start of next season, has signed until the end of 2014. Second XI players Clark, Davies, Lilley and Procter have all agreed two-year contracts and youth scholar Liam Livingstone has been handed a one-year professional deal. The deals follow the signing of England one-day wicketkeeper Jos Buttler from Somerset, and Watkinson said in September that the club was committed to keeping a "Lancashire core" to its side next season. </body>

      <body>Ex-Manchester United star Paul Scholes has taken training at Stalybridge Celtic, it has emerged. The former England international, 38, who coaches United's Under-19s side, helped out after manager Jim Harvey left the Conference North club.  "He wanted it kept private and the lads, although they were really excited, were brilliant in not letting it out," revealed chairman Rob Gorski. Scholes retired for a second time this summer after winning his 11th title. He has close ties with Stalybridge as his son Aaron is part of their youth set-up and Scholes has previously played in a charity game  for the club, who are in the sixth tier of English football. "I asked Paul, in a private moment, to be honest with me about the lads and their ability and he was sincere when he said that he'd watched Oldham play a couple of times this season, and he thought that many of our players were technically their equal," added Gorksi in a post on the club's website forum.  "Paul is going back to work with the United Under-19s but he's gone back with great memories and everyone's really appreciated having him around. A truly class guy." Stalybridge have now appointed Keith Briggs and Andy Fearn as their new management team. </body>

      <body>A lake that inspired William Wordsworth and Beatrix Potter is being put up for sale on eBay. Esthwaite Water, between Windermere and Coniston, is the largest privately owned lake in the Lake District. Owner Nigel Woodhouse is selling the 280-acre lake and its established leisure businesses, due to his approaching retirement age. The listed price of £300,000 includes the lease, and its Victorian boathouse, fisherman's lodge, and shop. Mr Woodhouse said the lease had 13 years remaining. Wordsworth featured Esthwaite Water in his Lyrical Ballads, and Potter, the creator of Peter Rabbit and Jeremy Fisher, described it as her favourite lake. The seller notes describe it as a "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity". "It is the largest stocked fishing lake in the north-west region, with significant winter trading. "Home to Jeremy Fisher, with a licensed Beatrix Potter nature trail, and huge potential to capitalise on the well-established Beatrix Potter market." The owner said he hoped that advertising online would attract international interest from potential buyers. However, Richard Greenwood, head of policy and research at Cumbria Tourism, said: "It's a bit of a one off, isn't it? "I've heard of houses in the lakes being raffled but never a lake being sold on eBay. "So, I have no idea quite what reaction that's going to get. "I think it's probably of more interest to the local people." </body>

      <title>Why academics are taking comic books seriously</title>
      <description>Academics in thrall to formerly "throwaway" literature</description>

      <body>Thousands of comic fans are descending on a small Cumbrian town this weekend for an international festival. Among them will be a growing number of academics who are now taking the art form - previously regarded by many as "throwaway" - as seriously as other literature. With Batman, Superman and The Avengers dominating box offices after making the leap from the page to the big screen, comic-inspired characters have been making a comeback for years. But it is not just cinema-goers who are drawn to the exploits of cartoon creations. Academics are also taking an increasing interest in the world of comics and graphic novels. There are now thought to be about 150 comic scholars in the UK - university lecturers, PhD students and independent researchers. They are exploring how subjects such as gender, feminism, history and mental and physical health are portrayed. Dr Mel Gibson, a comic book expert at Northumbria University, said the genre had "matured" in the 1980s, mainly thanks to British writers such as Bryan Talbot, Alan Moore and Grant Morrison. "That's also when academics got involved. But it's not ivory tower stuff, it's rooted in the real world. It has practical applications," she said. Dr Gibson is one of 50 leading figures from the world of graphic novels who will be appearing at the inaugural Lakes International Comic Art Festival in Kendal from Friday until Sunday. With writers, artists and industry figures coming from as far afield as Japan, the United States and Scandinavia, the event promises to transform the picturesque Cumbrian market town. While there are still only a handful of courses across the UK dedicated solely to comics and graphic novels, Dr Gibson says they find their way into many traditional undergraduate subjects. "Some of my final-year students are looking at children's literature and as part of that they will explore comics and graphic novels," she said. "They can even be included in social work studies and paediatric nursing - Bryan Talbot's The Tale of One Bad Rat has been used by health professionals around the world dealing with people who have suffered childhood abuse. "The victims might not want to or be able to talk about their situation, but through the story they can begin a discussion. That's a valuable tool for a health worker to have in their arsenal." The Tale of One Bad Rat, written in 1994, tells the story of a girl who flees London to escape sexual abuse at the hands of her father. "That is the graphic novel I'm most proud of," said Talbot. "I still get people today writing to me to say they were abused and that the book helped them cope." The 61-year-old - a founding patron of the Lakes event - is a doyen of the comic art world. Originally from Wigan, he has lived in Sunderland for the past 15 years with his wife Mary, an academic-turned-graphic novelist, and the pair won the Costa 2012 biography prize after teaming up for Dotter of Her Father's Eyes. It was with one of the first British graphic novels, The Adventures of Luther Arkwright, that Talbot made his name in the late 1970s. A story of parallel worlds, it features several nods to the poet William Blake. More recently, 2007's Alice in Sunderland explored the links between the North East city and author Lewis Carroll, mixing myth and history along the way. In recognition of his work, Bryan was given an honorary doctorate by Sunderland University in 2009 while last year he was presented with an honorary degree of doctor of letters by Northumbria University. "Academic interest has grown over the years and I'm proud," he said. "Someone once sent me a PhD thesis they had written about Luther Arkwright and its historical elements. "When I started working in comics it was almost like working at the bottom of the artistic barrel. To most people they were only just more interesting than patterned toilet paper. "Steadily they gained credibility, but that's down to the talent of the writers and illustrators. If the novels weren't any good then no one would be taking any notice of them." Taking inspiration from the annual Angouleme International Comics Festival in France - which draws 250,000 fans - the Lakes event will feature ticketed exhibitions, workshops and panels, as well as a programme of free family-friendly events. Venues across the town will stage sessions, shops are displaying artwork by schoolchildren and college students while the town hall will even replace its Union flag with one bearing the Batman logo. Talbot's latest work, again in partnership with his wife Mary, as well as illustrator Kate Charlesworth, is Sally Heathcote: Suffragette - a tale following a maid-of-all-work and the fight for the vote in Edwardian Britain. For academics such as Dr Gibson, gender is a key area of study. "Sally Heathcote is an example of a strong central female character - something comics are now very good at," she said. "For a while it was forgotten that girls read comics, much less that they were represented within them. "In the 1960s publications such as Jackie featured comic strips, but they disappeared over a period of 20 years and those titles began to steer girls towards magazines like Cosmopolitan rather than comics, which is different to the way boys' reading patterns were shaped." For Dr Gibson the move from a niche, underground offering to graphic novels being seen by many as having mainstream educational appeal is a welcome one. "Graphic novels were once seen as throwaway, but now they are more highly valued and viewed as things which deserve space on the bookshelf." </body>

      <title>Dark secrets of radio broadcaster</title>
      <description>How Michael Souter used his position to prey on boys</description>

      <body>As a boy in Scotland, Michael Souter dreamt of appearing in court - but not in the dock. The man who would later broadcast to thousands for BBC Radio Norfolk and Radio Clyde planned to follow in his father's footsteps and become a lawyer. Four decades later he would find himself in court, but as the defendant in a sexual abuse trial. Souter was found guilty of the abuse after a six-week trial at Norwich Crown Court. The court heard he used his local celebrity status to enable him to groom his victims. It marked a remarkable fall from grace for an outwardly respectable man who insisted he was only ever "doing my bit" for the community. The youngest of four boys, Souter grew up in the small town of Lenzie, near Glasgow, attending a "normal, middle-class academy". Aged 17, he joined the Royal Navy on a scholarship, going to the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth. "I was supposed to go to university in the third year and study law," he told the court. "The deal was that I would become a barrister. But the Navy decided it didn't need so many barristers so I never became a lawyer." Instead, Souter was sent to the Royal Fleet Auxiliary for four years, serving on supply ships. Quizzed about his sexuality in court, Souter said he was heterosexual but admitted to some "casual" gay encounters while at sea. "That's what happens so often," he said. He continued to serve in the Royal Naval Reserve as a lieutenant commander until he turned 55 in 2008. Beginning his broadcasting career at Radio Clyde, Souter moved to the fledgling BBC Radio Norfolk in 1980. "I was supposed to be Radio Norfolk's John Noakes," he told the court. "I was the guy who, if they wanted someone to parachute out of a plane, would be stupid enough to do it." Former colleagues remember him as an able, if brash, broadcaster who did not tend to mix socially with others from the station. Some felt there was something "creepy" about him, even if they did not know exactly what. Souter had been involved with the Scout movement since he was a boy and in 1981 became a leader, setting up a Venture Scout unit for older teenagers and young adults. He also volunteered for Norfolk County Council's Link-Up scheme, mentoring vulnerable youngsters. He said he got involved as a way of building links with the community. However, it was through Scouts and Link-Up that he met several of his victims. Souter owned property in Spain and moved there in 2005 before settling in a bungalow in the small Norfolk town of Loddon. A bachelor, he admitted in police interviews to being "a little bit bisexual", enjoying dressing as a schoolboy to be spanked by older men. The jury also heard that after abuse allegations were made against him in 1993, Souter told a social worker he had no sexual interest in boys. He boasted that married women found him attractive and said he had had a number of affairs. In court he cut a solitary figure, attending and leaving alone each day, pulling a small suitcase behind him. The jury was told his photo collection included many of boys in shorts and uniform, which Souter insisted were innocent, along with a small number of indecent images. Souter said he always carried a camera and took photos of everything, adding that pictures of boys represented only a small part of his collection. He was active, too, on social media. In August he tweeted that he had applied for tickets for next summer's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. But with Souter now set to face a lengthy jail term, it seems unlikely he will be making the trip back to his home city. </body>

      <title>Why did it go wrong at Al-Madinah?</title>
      <description>Why did it go so wrong at Al-Madinah free school?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24569961</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70548000/jpg/_70548135_madinah.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Described as "dysfunctional" and "in chaos", there can be no doubt that the problems at the Al-Madinah School go right to its core. Rated inadequate in all four inspection areas, Ofsted said problems at the Derby school were "myriad". Not only does it lack the basic structures needed to operate, it is said to be close to "collapsing". Al-Madinah is the second free school to be put into special measures, after Discovery Free School in May 2013. A further five out of the 24 inspected so far have been labelled "requiring improvement" - the next worse category. But then it is only two years into the programme. Across England the latest Ofsted figures show that 2% of state schools are in special measures - 383 out of 21,186 inspections. But no up-and-running free school has unravelled quite so publicly as this Derby-based Muslim faith school. It started with claims about female staff being required to wear hijabs, Islamic headscarves, but the focus has shifted to the "unacceptable" level of education the government and inspectors now say it is providing. The key thing that makes this Ofsted report stand out, is the fact that the findings come just a year after the school opened. Most schools that deteriorate tend to do so over a much longer period of time. And many of the problems it highlights seem to have implications for the particular nature of free schools and the extra freedoms they are allowed. The report's second line says: "This is a school which has been set up and run by representatives of the community with limited knowledge and experience." Education Secretary Michal Gove argued that taking schools out of the hands of bureaucrats would liberate innovators to push up standards through reform and experimentation. But the Ofsted findings in this case reflect exactly what detractors of such DIY school projects feared would happen. They asked how people who knew little about education could set up and run something so complex and important as a school. In addition, teaching, which the government sees as the most important engine raising attainment, was found to be "inadequate". "Many teachers are inexperienced and have not received the training and support they need," the Ofsted report said. This seems to highlight one of the most fundamental differences between free schools and regular state schools - there is no obligation to employ qualified teachers in England's free schools. The Department for Education argued that it gave free schools this freedom, which exists amongst independent schools, to enable them to employ industry experts. But this does not appear to have worked in the pupils' favour in the Al-Madinah case. The Ofsted report said: "Almost all teaching seen during the inspection, including in the Early Years Foundation Stage, was judged inadequate." It added that most teaching and lessons in the primary school were poorly planned and that teachers did not know how to use pupils' assessments to plan lessons and set work. Questions are now being asked about how the Department for Education could approve a school for opening one year, only for it to be found to lack the "basic systems" it needs to operate 12 months later. Were the checks necessary for ensuring the school would be fit for purpose undertaken in a sufficiently rigorous way? Judging from the pre-registration report undertaken by Ofsted in the July before it opened, no assessment was made by the inspectorate of the school's ability to educate pupils. But Ofsted did wave the red flag at this stage over child protection measures, saying that four regulations had not yet been met and that staff needed to undertake training on such issues. This was highlighted by shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt in an emergency question in the Commons. The DfE has insisted that it took all necessary steps to ensure the school was fit for purpose when it opened in September 2012. It said: "Ofsted recommended Al-Madinah should be registered as long as four requirements were met. "Ofsted often sets out a number of requirements it wants to see before new schools can open. In this case, [Al-Madinah Education Trust] provided the necessary evidence to show that these requirements were met." But the report also said the school had "not been adequately monitored or supported". Prime Minister David Cameron has taken to local radio to say that the school should close if it does not take immediate action to put things right. But he also said that this particular case should not be used as a "stick to beat the whole free school movement" as these were delivering a better standard of education than most state schools. He quoted figures hailed by the DfE earlier in the year which said three-quarters of the first free schools were rated good or outstanding - which a spokesman pointed out was a significantly higher proportion than all state schools. But a check of the latest Ofsted data reveals that a higher proportion of state schools (78%) are rated good or outstanding compared with 75% of free schools. But Mr Hunt said the education of children in Derby was being sacrificed for ideology. He added: "It's not just the Al-Madinah School which is dysfunctional, it's the education secretary's free school policy." </body>

      <body>Google shares have topped $1,000 (£617) for the first time after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. The company posted a 36% jump in net profits to $2.97bn for the July-to-September period. Shares in the giant online search and ads company rose more than 13% to $1,006, and are now up 41% since the start of 2013. Google's revenues also beat forecasts with a 12% rise year-on-year. "We are closing in on our goal of a beautiful, simple, and intuitive experience regardless of your device," Google's chief Larry Page said in a conference call with analysts. The strong earnings report also helped other online companies, with Facebook shares adding 4.4% to a new high of more than $55. Amazon rose 3.4%. At $1,000 a share, Google's market value is about $334bn, which is still well below Apple's $461bn. Google was floated in August 2004 at $85 a share, giving the company a market value at the time of $23bn. The company reported its quarterly earnings on Thursday after US markets had closed. Google said that paid-for clicks increased by a quarter during the July-to-September period, from a year earlier, the highest rate of growth in the past year. This offset an 8% fall in average cost-per-click, the price advertisers pay Google when consumers click on their ads. "We view solid paid clicks growth to be a good indicator of demand, driven by the continued shift to mobile," JP Morgan analysts said in a note. Several brokers have raised their share price target for Google on the back of the company's new initiatives to attract advertisers. In February, the company launched a service to help advertisers market through a mix of smartphones, tablets and desktop computers. And analysts believe there is still significant potential to generate revenues from its video-streaming website YouTube. YouTube-branded video-ads surged more than 75% in the quarter from a year earlier, with 40% of traffic now coming from mobile devices. "We estimate that Google's key YouTube asset generated approximately $4bn in revenue in 2012, positioning Google extremely well for the strong growth in video advertising," RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. Analysts at Jefferies said Google is best positioned to benefit from mobile devices with one billion activations of its Android system. Google sells applications and content through its Google Play store. </body>

      <title>Biggest petrol price fall since 2008</title>
      <description>The AA says petrol prices have recorded their biggest monthly fall since 2008, taking the average cost of a litre of fuel to 132.16p.</description>

      <body>The AA says petrol prices have recorded their biggest fall since 2008, taking the average cost to 132.16p a litre. The motorists' lobby group said average petrol prices fell 5.49p a litre between mid-September and mid-October, the biggest monthly fall since prices fell 11.5p in November 2008. The price of diesel has fallen from 142.50p a litre to 139.12p. The AA said lower wholesale fuel prices had prompted the price drop, but warned that further falls were unlikely. The organisation says the recent drop in prices means the cost of filling up the tank of a small petrol car has fallen by £2.74, while a larger vehicle, such as a Ford Mondeo, would cost £3.84 less to refuel. Northern Ireland is the most expensive place for petrol, with an average pump price of £132.9p a litre, and London, the north of England, and Yorkshire and Humberside are the joint cheapest at 131.9p. Scotland is still the most expensive for diesel at 140.1p a litre, while London is the cheapest at 138.6p. Regional variations depend on whether an area is mainly urban - in which case there is more competition - or if it is mainly rural - in which case suppliers have higher transport costs and there is less competition. Overall, the AA says the UK has the seventh-highest petrol price and the second-highest diesel price in Europe. The fuel price data is supplied by the research firm Experian Catalist. The AA said further falls in petrol prices were unlikely, because of poor refinery capacity in the UK and the likely strengthening of the US dollar. The US dollar is expected to rise in value now that the standoff over the country's budget is over and oil is priced in dollars. The AA's president, Edmund King, said: "A more than £2.50-a-tank cut in petrol costs for families is a dramatic improvement on its own. But, heading into winter with cars using more fuel, the timing couldn't be better. "Alongside Asda, Sainsbury's decision to fully reflect the fall in wholesale prices has been a huge benefit for drivers and businesses. "However, the AA is also encouraged by the growing band of non-supermarket retailers challenging the pricing of other supermarkets whose prices in many places are far less generous," he added. The organisation said that the situation at the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland, where a dispute between management and unions has led to a temporary closure, had highlighted the UK's lack of refinery capacity. It urged the government to find ways to support domestic refineries. </body>

      <title>Cable defends Royal Mail sale price</title>
      <description>Business Secretary Vince Cable defends the 330p flotation price of Royal Mail on a day when shares in the company briefly touched £5.</description>

      <body>Business Secretary Vince Cable has defended the 330p flotation price of Royal Mail on a day when shares in the company briefly touched £5. Value for money was important, but it was "about more than just the level of proceeds received on day one" of the flotation, he said in a letter to MPs. Some big investors declined to invest in Royal Mail, while others were uneasy about possible strike action, he added. The remarks were made to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. In the letter, Mr Cable says the price was set to ensure a successful transaction, good value, the ability to sell off the remaining government stake in the business and it being able to access finance from the markets. The price range was determined using market testing which involved consulting with a core group of 20 investment institutions. It was also priced relative to comparable companies operating elsewhere in Europe. He said that the threat of industrial action by the postal workers' union was also a factor that influenced the initial price range. "There were some investors who stated that they were not willing to invest at all and many others who focused on the business and financial implications of strike action," Mr Cable said. The letter says it was the banks employed to coordinate the sale - Goldman Sachs and UBS - that recommended the 260p to 330p price range for the shares. This was also endorsed by the government's independent adviser, the investment bank Lazard. The consultation process with investors, known as "pilot fishing", revealed that there would be sufficient demand for shares at the bottom of the range, even with the threat of industrial action. A slightly lower upper end for the price range was initially recommended. That was subsequently revised upwards "following ongoing positive feedback", he said. The final 330p float price was agreed based on final demand indications. It was endorsed by Lazard. The investment bank has now been asked to appear before the BIS Select committee amid concerns that Royal Mail was sold off too cheaply. When it became clear the share offer was many times oversubscribed (20 times for the institutional offer, seven times for the retail offer) the government did consider revising the price upwards. But this was not done "based on an assessment of the composition of demand... and an assessment of where demand would taper off," Mr Cable writes. There was also a view that this would introduce an "execution risk" to the sell off. Mr Cable said the banks helping with the sell off "recommended against increasing the price range; this advice was endorsed by Lazard". The letter does not address why the current price of Royal Mail has gone so high. But its understood the government believes this is down to the scarcity of shares available. It also believes hedge funds - some from the US - may be buying at this elevated price in the belief that Royal Mail may be transformed and modernised quicker than anticipated. </body>

      <title>China's economic growth speeds up</title>
      <description>China's economic growth picks up pace in the July-to-September period according to officials figures - the first rise in three quarters.</description>

      <body>China's economic growth picked up pace in the July-to-September period, the first rise in three quarters. The world's second-biggest economy grew 7.8% from a year earlier, up from 7.5% expansion in the previous quarter. The official figures also showed growth in industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment. After years of blistering growth, China has seen its pace of expansion slow recently and there have been fears that growth may slow further. China has set a growth target of 7.5% for the year. Analysts said the latest numbers indicated that it was likely that Beijing would meet this. "This is an indication that China's economic growth is holding up in a range which is within the comfort zone of both the Chinese policymakers as well as global watchers," said Song Seng Wun, a senior economist with CIMB Research . Over the past few decades China has relied heavily on its exports and manufacturing sectors as well as government-led infrastructure spending to help boost growth. However, a slowdown in key markets such as the US and Europe has hurt demand for its exports. As a result, it has been trying to spur domestic demand to offset the decline in foreign sales and also to rebalance its growth. Earlier this year, it unveiled fresh measures to help boost the economy. From 1 August, China has suspend value-added tax (VAT) and turnover tax for small businesses with monthly sales of less than 20,000 yuan ($3,257; £2,125). The cabinet said the move would benefit more than six million small companies and boost employment and income for millions of people. Policymakers said they would also implement measures to simplify customs clearance procedures, cut operational fees and facilitate the exports of small and medium-sized private enterprises. The cabinet also announced plans to completely open China's railway construction market to private investors to develop the sector further. It said it would set up a railway development fund, with the initial money coming from the government. Analysts said the moves were starting to have an impact on the growth numbers. "There is certainly a build up of momentum among the small manufacturers, which is an indication that China's policies targeted at them are working," said Tony Nash, vice-president at IHS. Factory output rose 10.2% in September, from a year earlier. Meanwhile, retail sales rose 13.3% and fixed asset investment jumped 20.2% during the month from levels a year ago. Tim Condon of ING added that the measures may help China sustain its growth rate in the current quarter as well. "The mini-stimulus we've seen is enough to keep it going at this pace in the fourth quarter," Mr Condon said. However, there have been some concerns over whether the economic rebound is sustainable in the long run, not least due to the continued rise in property prices. Property prices have now risen for eight months in a row, despite government efforts to cool the market. Some analysts have said that China's new leaders, who took charge in March, have so far tolerated the price rises due to concerns over slowing economic growth. According to some estimates, about 25% of overall investment in China goes towards property, making it one of the most important growth sectors. But the continued surge in prices has fanned fears that asset bubbles may be forming. "Between real estate and the lending environment, there are concerns that things may be heating up," said Mr Nash of IHS. "If not addressed properly, and in time, it could pose a serious threat to China's growth." Analysts said that with growth rebounding, Beijing may take measures to try and curb speculation in the property market. "We think the recovery in the third quarter was mainly driven by the strong momentum of the property market," said Shen Jianguang, chief China economist with Mizuho Securities in Hong Kong. "The government concerns about an over-heated property market are increasing, and tougher measures to curb rising prices may be forthcoming. "We expect gross domestic product (GDP) growth will slow to 7.6% in the fourth quarter," he added. </body>

      <title>Private rents 'hit record high'</title>
      <description>The cost of renting a home privately across England and Wales has reached a record high of £757 a month, according to a survey.</description>

      <body>The average cost of renting a home privately across England and Wales has reached a record high of £757 a month, according to a survey. Average rents rose by 2.1% in September compared with the same month a year earlier, LSL Property Services said. This was a 1.8% increase on August, driven by a 3.3% rise in the south east of England. The figures come as mortgage lenders reported another strong month in September, after a summer flurry. LSL said that greater demand from tenants was pushing up rental prices. "Higher rents in almost every region show that, despite government schemes, buying a first home is still a difficult aspiration," said David Newnes, director of LSL, which owns estate agents Reeds Rains and Your Move. "This is not only down to low salary growth, but also a general shortage of supply - which is the underlying reason why homes are getting more expensive. The long-term trend to renting therefore looks unlikely to change significantly in the near future." The government has brought forward its Help to Buy scheme, which aims to assist those who can afford mortgage payments, but struggle to raise the necessary deposit to secure a mortgage and purchase a home. However, critics have said that the scheme could create a housing market bubble, with official statistics suggesting UK house prices are already at a record high. Figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), also published on Friday, showed that mortgage lending for house purchases continued its summer strength. Gross mortgage lending in the UK stood at £16.2bn in September, slightly below lending of £16.4bn in August, but 41% higher than lending of £11.5bn in September last year. "Indicators suggest we are witnessing the strongest house purchase performance in five years. House prices too have revived but modestly, aside from a resurgent London market," said CML chief economist Bob Pannell. The LSL survey suggested that tenants' finances were stretched. Some 8.5% of all rent across England and Wales was late in September, up from 7.8% in August. However, the annual rise in rental costs was still slower than the general increase in the cost of living, with the Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation at 2.7% in September. </body>

      <title>Bank says rate rise unlikely in 2014</title>
      <description>The Bank of England's chief economist Spencer Dale says economic conditions are unlikely to improve enough to merit a rate rise next year.</description>

      <body>The Bank of England's chief economist, Spencer Dale, says economic conditions are unlikely to improve enough to merit a rise in interest rates next year. In a question and answer session on the social network Twitter, he said the UK would need to see sustained growth before rates rose from the 0.5% level. Earlier this week he said that rates could rise in 2014 if conditions were strong enough. Mr Dale is one of the nine people at the Bank that set monetary policy. As might be expected from a central banker, Mr Dale gave little in the way of surprises in his answers on current monetary policy. In its latest minutes, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it would make no change to the £375bn of monetary stimulus it is providing through its quantitative easing (QE) programme. The programme, brought in to give an extra stimulus because interest rates could barely be cut below the current record low of 0.5%, has been criticised by some for helping the financial markets and the banks, by making money cheap, rather than the economy as a whole. Many questioners wanted to know about QE. Asked "is Quantitative Easing a necessary evil? What will be the implications on the UK's macroeconomic objectives?", Mr Dale replied:"QE not evil. Has helped to support economy and protect jobs." Another of the big economic debates in the country is whether or not house prices are rising dangerously high. When asked if he had any concerns that there was a housing bubble, fuelled by the Help to Buy scheme which helps borrowers struggling to raise a deposit, Mr Dale answered: "A healthy housing market is good for economy. But watching carefully for overheating." Twitter's unfiltered nature inevitably draws offbeat comments. Of less importance to UK economy watchers was "do you ever polish the gold 1Kg brick in the museum?" "No need," was the reply, "It stays shiny without out being polished." But questions to Mr Dale answered in the hour-long session were markedly more serious and respectful than the session held by British Gas on Thursday, which was widely hailed as a lesson in how not to engage through social media. </body>

      <body>(Open): Shares in Morgan Stanley rose 2.3% after the investment bank reported a 50% jump in third quarter revenues. The bank's revenues rose to $7.93bn (£4.9bn) in the July-to-September period, up from $5.28bn a year earlier, helped by equities sales and trading. Stripping out one-off items, profits rose to $1.01bn from $560m a year earlier. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones fell 24.53 points to 15,347.12 while the SandP 500 rose 5.94 points to 1,739.09. The Nasdaq was up 21.62 points at 3,884.97. Google shares broke through the $1,000 mark after the search engine reported better-than-expected quarterly results on Thursday. Quarterly revenues were up by 23%, helped by an increase in mobile and video advertising. General Electric rose 2.5% despite reporting a fall in quarterly profits and revenues. GE's shares were buoyed by news that the company had a record backlog of orders, which it said left it in good shape for 2014. </body>

      <body>One of the UK's smallest energy suppliers - Co-operative Energy - has joined two of the big firms in announcing price rises. The firm, which started in 2011 and has 150,000 customers, will increase gas and electricity prices by 4.5%. Existing customers will see their bills go up from 8 January, but the price rise will take effect for new customers from Monday. SSE and British Gas have outlined price rises in recent days. SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills from 15 November and British Gas said prices for its customers would go up by 9.2% on 23 November. These two are part of the group of major UK domestic energy suppliers, known as the "big six". Ministers have said it has been difficult for smaller firms to compete with these major firms. Co-operative Energy, which operates in England, Scotland and Wales and is part of The Midcounties Co-operative, said it had absorbed half of the increased costs it was facing. "Due to increasing energy market costs beyond our control, namely the costs associated with buying energy and getting it into customers' homes, we find ourselves in the position of having to now pass these costs on to our customers," said Ramsay Dunning, general manager of Co-operative Energy. </body>

      <body>Canada and the European Union have struck a free trade agreement aimed at boosting growth and employment. The deal will lower tariffs, streamline regulation, and cut red tape. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso agreed the deal at a meeting in Brussels on Friday. Mr Barroso said they had reached a "breakthrough in negotiations" to achieve "a great agreement for both the European Union and Canada". The deal still requires approval by parliaments and EU member states. Once approved, the agreement aims to make it easier for companies in Canada and the 28-member EU bloc to invest in and sell to each other. The European Union is Canada's second-largest trading partner behind the US. Mr Harper said the agreement was "the biggest (trade) deal our country has ever made". It will give Canada access to a market of some 500 million people in the EU, making it bigger even than the country's North American Free Trade Agreement signed with the US and Mexico. The European Commission expects the deal to increase bilateral trade in goods and services by a fifth to 25.7bn euros ($35bn; £21.7bn) a year. The commission is negotiating trade pacts with more than 80 countries on behalf of the bloc's members following the collapse of the Doha global trade talks. </body>

      <title>Toyota to recall 885,000 vehicles</title>
      <description>Toyota is recalling 885,000 vehicles, mainly in North America, to fix a problem that could lead to airbags being disabled or inadvertently deploying.</description>

      <body>Toyota is recalling 885,000 vehicles to fix a problem that could cause a water leak from the air conditioning unit. It said water could leak into the airbag control module, causing a short circuit and triggering a warning light. In some cases airbags "could become disabled or could inadvertently deploy" and in limited cases the power steering function could be disabled, it added. The models affected by the recall are the Camry, Camry Hybrid, Avalon, Avalon Hybrid, and Venza made in 2012-13. Some 847,000 cars will be recalled in North America, while the rest will be in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. A spokeswoman for Toyota told the BBC that it had received reports of two minor injuries due to the issue, but there had been no reports of any vehicles crashing. This is the third major recall that Toyota has issued in recent weeks. Last month, the company called back more than 780,000 vehicles in the US to address a suspension defect in its RAV4 and Lexus HS 250h models, after fears that an initial recall last year did not fix the problem. In September, it recalled 615,000 Sienna minivans in the US to fix a lever problem that could cause vehicles to shift out of park mode "without the driver depressing the brake pedal". Toyota said at the time that it was aware of 24 "minor accidents" due to the issue. In recent weeks more than 2.2 million vehicles have been recalled. Analysts said the recalls could have an impact on its reputation with the customers. "Repeated recalls definitely dent the image of any carmaker," Vivek Vaidya, an auto analyst with consulting firm Frost and Sullivan told the BBC. "If you have one big recall, it is still manageable. But if (a company) calls back different vehicle models at different times for unrelated issues, customers tend to have a re-think about your quality assurance. "And if the problem involves airbag deployment - it becomes a serious issue," he added. The latest move takes the total number of cars recalled by Toyota this year to six million vehicles. </body>

      <body>Women's fashion chain Bonmarche, which sells to the over-50s age group, is planning to list its shares on the stock market. It has 264 stores but also sells online and through mail-order systems, including a TV channel. Bonmarche was owned by fashion chain Peacocks, but was bought in 2012 by investors Sun European Partners when Peacocks went into administration. Bonmarche says it has 1.8 million customers in its loyalty club. The chain has the licence to use the David Emmanuel name, one half of the team that designed Princess Diana's wedding dress in the early 1980s. Announcing its intention to float, the company cited figures from the Office for National Statistics and retail specialists Verdict predicting that the number of women over the age of 55 - its target market - would be 16% higher in 2018 than in 2008. Bonmarche says there are a limited number of rivals serving this market. The firm's chief executive, Beth Butterwick, said: "The success and strong performance enjoyed by the business over the last 18 months... makes this an opportune time to bring the company to AIM [London's junior share market]." Sun European Partners, whose main assets and base are in the US, also owns the Jacques Vert chain in the UK. Bonmarche has its head office in Wakefield in West Yorkshire. It was founded in 1982 and bought by Peacocks in 2002. </body>

      <body>British Gas is to increase prices for domestic customers, with a dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November. The increase, which will affect nearly eight million households in the UK, includes an 8.4% rise in gas prices and a 10.4% increase in electricity prices. The company said it "understands the frustration" of prices rising faster than incomes. The average annual household bill will go up by £123. PM David Cameron has urged consumers to switch suppliers for the best deal. Energy Minister Ed Davey has described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers. Rival SSE has already announced an 8.2% increase in bills from 15 November. On average, customers will see a dual-fuel bill increase to £1,444 a year. However, there are significant regional variations. On average, the biggest increase in a dual-fuel bill is an 11.2% rise in the north of Scotland, in the Scottish Hydro Electric region. The smallest is a 6.8% increase in the south west of England. The company said that the cost of buying energy on the global markets, delivering gas and electricity to customers' homes, and the government's "green" levies, were all factors in the decision to put up prices. "I know these are difficult times for many customers and totally understand the frustration that so many household costs keep on rising when incomes are not keeping pace," said Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas Residential Energy. "We haven't taken this decision lightly, but what is pushing up energy prices at the moment are costs that are not all directly under our control." The company, which operates as Scottish Gas in Scotland, said it made a profit of five pence in the pound after tax. British Gas, the UK's biggest energy supplier, said in May that a profit boost would be used to delay future price rises. This came because customers used 18% more gas in the first four months of the year owing to the cold weather. At the time, a spokesman said: "We will use that [cold weather benefit] to effectively hold prices for as long as possible." Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. Caroline Flint, shadow energy secretary, said: "These latest price rises show clearer than ever why Labour's price freeze is needed." Party leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But the prime minister branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. Mr Cameron also said he was disappointed with the British Gas' announcement. "I would encourage customers who are not happy with the service they're getting, are not happy with the prices, to go to the switching sites online and see whether they can get a better deal," he said. Pressed on whether the government could do more to tackle the underlying issues, Mr Cameron added: "What we can do, which is what we are doing, is to try to get new suppliers into the market." Energy Minister Ed Davey also described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers of British Gas. He questioned the claim that costs imposed by the government were increasing as much as bills and told the Commons that unhappy consumers should consider switching suppliers. However, industry analysts expect other suppliers to announce price rises in the coming weeks, which could affect consumers' switching decisions. "The question now is whether it will be a trickle or a stampede. However, the fact is that households will be struggling to afford to keep warm this winter," said Tom Lyon, of price comparison website Uswitch.com. Ofgem data shows the number of people switching energy companies is at the lowest since records began in 2003. Out of more than 27.7m electricity customers, 658,000 people switched companies in the three months from March to June in 2013, 17% less than the same quarter a year before. For gas, out of nearly 22m customers, 490,000 people transferred over the same three-month period, a 14% decline from 2012. Personal finance commentator and campaigner Martin Lewis said it was important that, if consumers do decide to switch, they should focus on fixed rate tariffs. Because only two of the energy companies have currently put their prices up, those who switch now are likely to be hit with price rises if they switch to another variable rate tariff. He said people can "beat the price hikes" by going to fixed tariffs. Adam Scorer, of watchdog Consumer Futures, said: "We would urge anyone worried about their energy costs to shop around to try to find a better deal and ensure they are on the cheapest payment method, such as direct debit. "There are also some discounted insulation and heating measures available and we would encourage people to take advantage of this to cut their bills." Mr Davey said that British Gas would need to justify its decision "openly and transparently". Many of British Gas's customers made their annoyance at the price rise known during a Twitter question and answer session with customer service Bert Pijls earlier this afternoon. </body>

      <body>(Noon): A pick up in the rate of China's economic growth helped to lift UK shares on Friday. The FTSE 100 index was up 26.71 points at 6,602.87, with the latest official figures from China showing the economy there grew by 7.8% in the third quarter from a year earlier. Shares in insurer Prudential rose 3.5% after Asian rival AIA Group reported strong third-quarter results. The news lifted Prudential as it has large business interests in Asia. Shares in Anglo American fell 1.5%, despite the mining firm reporting record copper production in the three months to September. However, iron ore output was much weaker than expected, with output down nearly a quarter from a year earlier. William Hill shares fell 3.4% after a downgrade from JP Morgan. On the currency markets, the pound rose 0.2% against the dollar to $1.6197 and rose 0.1% against the euro to 1.1834 euros. </body>

      <title>Bid for fuel discount in rural towns</title>
      <description>A fuel discount that applies to the Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly could be extended to remote and rural parts of the UK mainland.</description>

      <body>A fuel discount scheme in the Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly could be extended to 10 rural communities in mainland Scotland and England. The UK has applied to the European Commission (EC) for a 5p a litre reduction in fuel duty in those places. They are Acharacle, Achnasheen, Appin, Carrbridge, Dalwhinnie, Gairloch and Strathpeffer. Kirkby-in-Furness in Cumbria, Hawes in North Yorkshire and Lynton in Devon are also included. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said that, as a Highlander, he knew "all too well that fuel prices tend to be highest in areas where a car is needed the most". "We've already delivered a tax cut for remote islands and now want to extend that to mainland rural areas that suffer from similarly high prices to the islands," he added. "We have put together the strongest possible evidence base to try and maximise the places that get it." A decision from the EC is expected next year. "As I've said before, it won't be easy to get this agreed with the commission, but I will do everything I can to make this happen," Mr Alexander said. The 10 locations selected for the application have higher pump prices than in areas that already receive discount, are more than 100 miles by road from the nearest refinery and have a population density lower than 135 people per square km. Pete Williams, RAC head of external affairs, said the application was "good news" because many people in rural communities were "unfairly penalised by high fuel prices as they rely on their cars for work and day-to-day life". "It's also understandable that fuel retailers in these remote areas are selling petrol and diesel at higher prices due to increased distribution costs from being so far from refineries," he added. "Let's hope the European Commission will see the sense in easing the pain for these rural towns when they come to make their decision next year." Labour Treasury spokeswoman Catherine McKinnell said she hoped the announcement would bring relief for drivers in the selected areas. But she added: "Eight out of 10 of these areas have Liberal Democrat MPs - including two in Danny Alexander's own constituency. The public will want to be reassured this is no more than a coincidence because nobody will thank a Lib Dem Treasury minister who refuses to tackle the cost-of-living crisis everywhere but his own back yard." Mr Alexander told BBC Breakfast it was "total nonsense" to suggest the plans were designed to favour seats held by his party. The idea had been put forward by his party in its election manifesto, he said, but the locations had been chosen "according to a strict selection criteria". He said it "would be nice to have a longer list" but the 10 communities chosen had a "reasonable chance of being agreed". Introduced in March 2012, the discount currently applies to the Hebrides, Northern Isles, islands in the Clyde and the Isles of Scilly as well as other island communities in Europe. Retailers register with HM Revenue and Customs to claim 5p a litre relief on fuel for sale to the public. </body>

      <title>No deal over Grangemouth restart</title>
      <description>Management and unions at the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical plant fail to reach a deal to allow operations at the site to restart.</description>

      <body>Management and unions at the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical plant have failed to reach a deal which would see the site fired up again. Operators Ineos asked the Unite union to make a commitment to call no further industrial action this year. Unite said it would agree to this, but on the condition that Ineos would not impose its planned cuts on the workforce during the same period. The two sides held a face-to-face meeting at the plant earlier. Ineos said it would have restarted operations at the site on Friday if Unite had given the company a "no conditions, no strings attached" assurance of no further industrial action this year. However, it claimed the union had refused that offer. Calum MacLean, Ineos Grangemouth (UK) chairman, said: "Unite's response is unbelievable given how much effort has been put into securing this deal with ourselves, the Scottish and the UK governments all working hard to find a way forward. "We will now concentrate on discussing the Survival Plan with our staff during the 60-day consultation". Unite said it had already promised no strike action before Christmas but the union repeated its calls for Ineos to abandon proposed changes to staff contracts. Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scottish secretary, said: "At Acas talks earlier this week, Unite committed to conducting no industrial action ballots or industrial action before 31 December 2013. "This was on the basis that the company would not impose cuts on the workforce during the same period. Unite also proposed that these negotiations over the future of the site during this period would be held under the auspices of Acas." He added: "If the company lifts the cuts agenda that it is imposing on its workers, then our offer still stands." Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond earlier warned of a risk to the future of Grangemouth if the current stand-off continues. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, he said the longer site remained "idle and cold" the more difficult things would become. Mr Salmond met with Ineos and Unite representatives on Thursday. Ineos said shutting down the Grangemouth complex had cost the company £20m so far. The firm had put proposals over pay and pensions to workers at the complex, which has 1,400 employees and many more contractors. A letter outlining the proposed changes - which includes freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016 - was being couriered to employees on Friday. Unite claimed the company had told staff they could lose their jobs and be reemployed on poorer terms unless they agreed to give up their final salary pension, and accept pay freezes and pay cuts, by 18:00 on Monday. The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans. </body>

At the time WH Smith said it was disgusted by such titles and found them "unacceptable". WH Smith's website had been suspended since Monday following the revelations. WH Smith takes e-book content from Kobo.com. As a result of the scandal, Kobo has suspended the sale of all self-published books on its UK website. Since 14 October, visitors to the WH Smith website saw only a holding statement which said that the website, "will become live again once all self published e-books have been removed and we are totally sure that there are no offending titles available".

      <body>It surely seemed like a good way to present a human face to customers. On the day it announced prices would rise by 9.2%, British Gas decided to take to the micro-blogging site Twitter to conduct a QandA with its public. But the hashtag #AskBG instead ended up crowd-sourcing a riot of opinion that included black humour and rage. This one was straight to the point: "Social media car crash: British Gas hike energy bills by £123 and then ask Twitter what it thinks." Others were even more blunt: "I've been a loyal customer for a few years. How will you feel when pensioners die from choosing to eat instead of heat???" The session started civilly enough with a simple announcement that British Gas's customer services director would be available for questions. Among the few conventional questions was this: Claire asked: "@BritishGas I can barely make current payments to you. My income is v.low. Can you assist me, or shld I switch?" This was one of the minority of posts British Gas could give a simple answer to: "Hi Claire, if you are worried about rising energy costs please call us 0800 980 1917 or visit http://britishgas.co.uk/warmhomes." Such questions though were swamped by those expressing worry about their bills, or venting their anger at the cost of energy, with typical comments on the plight of pensioners and alternative fuels, such as £10 notes. British Gas sent out a statement after the session had closed: "Our announcement today is difficult news for customers. We didn't make this decision lightly. We know people are worried about rising energy prices and they want to talk about this - including on Twitter - and it's important we're there for them to talk to" It said the QandA was the "right thing to do". </body>

      <body>Retail sales grew by 0.6% in September compared with the previous month, following an unexpected fall in August. The Office for National Statistics also said sales volumes had risen by 2.2% compared with September 2012, despite a fall of sales in supermarkets. The retail sales figures are based on a monthly survey of 5,000 UK retailers. The performance of the retail industry is seen as an indicator of the wider economy and the strength of consumer spending. Furniture sales provided the biggest driver for the monthly rise in sales, owing to a pick-up in the housing market. Sales volumes in household goods stores grew by 3%. Retail sales have see-sawed in recent months. In July, the fine summer weather pushed sales up higher than expected, with barbecue food selling well. Then, a month later, consumers reined in spending, particularly on food, leading to a drop in sales volumes. In September, analysts had expected a rebound, but not to the degree seen in the latest official figures. In addition to household goods, sales at clothing, footwear and textile retailers increased by 1.2% compared with August. Ian Geddes, UK head of retail at Deloitte, said although confidence was rising, growth in wages remained "stubbornly low", so many consumers were "yet to benefit" from having more money. He said pressure was on for retailers to get their product and brand "exactly right". "Those who deliver highly desirable and creative products with distinctive and well-understood branding continue to reap the rewards," Mr Geddes added. David Tinsley, UK economist at BNP Paribas, said he expected recovery in the housing market to "start to show up shortly". But he said wages would have to rise before a more sustainable recovery could happen. "We would not be surprised to see some softer patches in retail spending ahead," he added. </body>

      <body>Labour has pledged to impose a levy on the profits of payday lenders to help support lower-cost lending from credit unions and boost money advice services. If elected in 2015, it would introduce an extra charge on the lenders, which charge up to 4,000% interest, on top of fees already paid by all finance firms. Shadow business minister Stella Creasy told the BBC it was "payback time for these payday lenders". Payday lenders say they provide a valuable service to their customers. But Ms Creasy, who became Labour's shadow consumer and competition minister in the recent reshuffle, said: "Some of these companies are making a million pounds a week. "They need to pay their share for the damage they're doing." She said the firms were "aggressively targeting people, and once they've got them in their claws, they keep squeezing and squeezing them". Ms Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, added: "Many other industries have set up voluntary organisations, like Drink Aware and Gambling Aware, when their products are causing problems. Yet this industry sits around saying there's no damage being done. "These companies need to take responsibility for the damage that they are causing in communities like mine, where I've got 18 of these companies on my high street alone. "So we're proposing to put a levy on them that can be used to fund the expansion of credit unions, who need more capital to be able to lend, and also debt and money advice services to help people with their finances, because we are struggling with the cost of living in this country." Ms Creasy's interview preceded a speech by Labour leader Ed Miliband, in which he said the measure was designed to help those already in "desperate need" and people at risk of racking up huge debts they cannot repay in future. The industry has been referred to the Competition Commission and regulators have promised a tightening of the rules, with all borrowers set to be offered an "affordability" check before being given a loan. Mr Miliband claimed that the squeeze on living standards was causing a "personal debt crisis" with a third of those taking out payday loans currently doing so to meet the cost of heating their homes. "The prices families have to pay keep on rising faster and faster than the wages they are paid," he said on a visit to south London. "For too many families the end of the month is now their own personal credit crunch." Labour has already said it will cap the cost of credit and give local authorities new powers to limit the spread of payday lending shops in town centres. But Mr Miliband added: "We must protect the most vulnerable people in our society from the worst of exploitation by payday lenders. "And it is right that the companies that benefit from people's financial plight, accept their responsibilities to help ensure affordable credit is available." He said the party would consult on the rate of the levy and how it will be implemented. Payday lenders, along with all financial service providers, already pay fees to the Financial Conduct Authority to help fund services such as debt advice. The government currently spends £13m on supporting the growth of credit unions but Labour says these organisations do not have the capacity nor the resources to offer help to all those who need it. Labour says the "explosion" in the payday lending market - with it says has doubled in size to £2.2bn in the last four years - is directly related to what it says is a "cost of living crisis". As many as five million families plan to borrow money from payday lenders in the next six months, and more than 1.5 million households spend more than 30% of their income on unsecured credit repayments, it says. Ministers say proposals announced by the Financial Conduct Authority earlier this month, including a ban on some products and a limit on the times loans can be rolled over, will "call time" on unscrupulous lenders. The Church of England has condemned the practices and ethics of some payday lenders and pledged to launch its own credit service to force many of them out business. But lenders say they are helping people in genuine need with no-one else to turn to and that firms who are members of Consumer Finance Association are heavily regulated already. </body>

      <title>Prince Charles in pensions warning</title>
      <description>The Prince of Wales tells the pensions industry to use a longer-term investing approach or risk a 'miserable future' for the next generation.</description>

      <body>The Prince of Wales has told the pensions industry to use a longer-term investing approach or risk a "miserable future" for the next generation. He warned a National Association of Pension Funds' (NAPF) conference that the current focus on short term investing was "unfit for purpose". Prince Charles said the pensions industry was vital for the economy "now and in the future". The NAPF said it was "pleased" he was "shining a light on these issues." Prince Charles cited "mounting evidence" from Harvard and London Business Schools showing that businesses willing to improve their approach to environmental and social challenges were more likely to deliver long-term returns. The prince said investors had a "duty" to manage risks from rising populations, climate change and "unprecedented levels" of financial indebtedness, he said. He added: "I can only urge you to deploy your considerable human ingenuity to make that innovative and imaginative leap that the world so badly needs." "Otherwise your grandchildren and mine, for that matter will be consigned to an exceptionally miserable future." NAPF chief executive Joanne Segars said sustainability and environmental issues were important to long-term pension fund investors, and were the basis for providing good pensions for people in future. Former pensions adviser to the government Ros Altmann agreed with the prince's comments. She said: "Pensions are meant to deliver long-term value. What we don't want is to get hijacked by the short-term and sell our children's future away." Ms Altmann said it was "clear" that changes needed to be made. "We are living for today in a dangerous way," she said. She said she understood why the short-term focus existed for political reasons, but that pension funds should not be operating on the same timetable. The government will enrol up to nine million more people in pensions during the next five years as fears grow that people are living for longer but not saving for their old age. A spokesperson for Saga, a company that focuses on the over 50s, said Prince Charles was "absolutely right" to speak out. He added: "Whilst the heir to the throne may have a secure future, many of his potential subjects have something altogether less savoury in store for their retirement." </body>

      <title>US government heads back to work</title>
      <description>US government employees are back at work after President Obama signed a law ending a government shutdown and raising the US debt limit.</description>

      <body>Hundreds of thousands of US government employees are back at work after President Barack Obama signed a law ending a 16-day government shutdown and extending the US debt limit. The cross-party deal came hours before the US government risked running out of money to pay its bills. "There are no winners," Mr Obama said, adding the US would "bounce back". The deal followed 16 days of partial government shutdown, which began when Congress failed to agree on a budget. Congress voted through the deal less hours before a deadline to raise the $16.7tn (£10.5tn) debt limit. The measure approved in Washington funds the government to 15 January, and extends the US Treasury's borrowing authority until 7 February. The deal does not resolve the budgetary issues that fiercely divide Republicans and Democrats. Instead, it establishes a cross-party committee of legislators tasked with crafting a long-term budget deal and reporting back to Congress by mid-December. A faction of Republicans in the hardline Tea Party movement had pushed for the confrontation as a way to gut Mr Obama's healthcare reform. However, Mr Obama and the Democrats refused to negotiate, and the law commonly known as Obamacare escaped relatively unscathed. On Thursday, Mr Obama thanked congressional leaders for their help ending the government shutdown and raising the debt limit, but said both had "inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy". "Nothing has done more to undermine our economy the last three years than the kind of tactics that create these kinds of manufactured crises," he said. Mr Obama said politicians had to stop listening to "talking heads" and activists "who profit from conflict" and instead focus on growing the economy and creating a responsible budget. "The American people are completely fed up with Washington," he said. "How business is done in this town has to change." Mr Obama called the political crises "a spectacle" which had hurt America's credibility in the world. And to the conservative Republicans who pushed the showdown as a way to extract policy concessions, he said: "Go out there and win an election." Politicians, bankers and economists had warned of global economic calamity unless an agreement to raise the US government's borrowing limit were reached. IMF head Christine Lagarde's positive response to the news was tempered by a call for further action. "It will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner," she said in a statement. Economists have estimated the shutdown cost the US economy billions of dollars. The shutdown affected Americans and visitors to the US in countless ways: most national parks were closed, medical research ground to a halt, and ordinary paperwork went unfinished, delaying visa applications, business permits and safety inspections. Hundreds of thousands of employees were put on leave without pay during the shutdown, with many forced to delay purchases or even payment of routine bills. A few days into the shutdown Congress passed a law ensuring they would receive back pay. Before dawn on Thursday, the US Office of Personnel Management, which manages the federal workforce, announced in a terse statement on its website that government workers should return to work as regularly scheduled. A senior manager at the Department of the Interior, which oversees the national parks system and other public land, reminded employees to disable "out of office" email messages, change voicemail prompts, and "check on any refrigerators and throw out any perished food". "We appreciate your sacrifices through these difficult times and we understand that the lapse in government activities has imposed hardships on you, your families, and the people we serve," Rhea Suh, assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, wrote. Federal workers returning to the downtown Washington DC office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were greeted by Vice-President Joe Biden and a welcome note from their boss, agency head Gina McCarthy. A security officer at the building said the shutdown had been "depressing" and had made her realise how much she enjoyed her job. "I enjoy checking in 500 people every day," said Ettereteen Welch. Spurred on by hardline conservatives, congressional Republicans forced the stand-off by linking budget measures to healthcare reform. Despite reluctant support from the House Republican leadership for the bill approved on Wednesday, most of the party's lawmakers in the House voted against it. Republican Congressman Mo Brooks told the Associated Press news agency the law that ended the shutdown merely delayed the fight. "We need to get to the underlying cause of the problem, which is our out-of-control spending and deficits," he said, "and fix it before it's too late and we go down the toilet to bankruptcy. Because that's where America is headed." </body>

      <title>Warning of future UK power shortages</title>
      <description>The UK power system is likely to be stretched "close to its limits" in the coming years, a new report warns.</description>

      <body>There is a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years, according to a report commissioned for the prime minister. The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits". Supply is particularly expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15. Last week the National Grid warned of a higher risk of blackouts this winter. The new study was commissioned by the prime minister's Council for Science and Technology to find out how stretched power supplies are likely to be during this decade. "Although the electricity supply is expected to be sufficient to cover predicted levels of demand, it is likely to stretch the system close to its limits, notably during the winter of 2014-15," the report said. Dr John Roberts, one of its authors, added: "We've looked back at real events that happened in the past which caused shocks to our system - like very cold winters, like major power stations shutting down. "If those things happen again in the future and we don't take measures to correct what's going on, then there's a serious risk that we will have power shortages." To avoid what its authors called "a blackout scenario by 2020", the report called on ministers to: Reacting to the report, Business Minister Michael Fallon said: "The lights are not going to go out. There will be a tightness in supply if nothing is done but stuff is being done. "We've opened six new gas plants already. Another is being built. You're going to hear very soon about our investment in new nuclear power stations." Two years ago the UK had a buffer between energy supply and demand of 16%, but this winter that will fall to 5% and it could hit 2% by 2015, according to the National Grid and the energy regulator, Ofgem. </body>

      <title>UK jobless total falls to 2.49m</title>
      <description>The number of unemployed in the UK fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million in the June-August period and employment hit a record high.</description>

      <body>The number of unemployed in the UK fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million in the June-August period, official figures show. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also said the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance last month fell by 41,700 to 1.35 million. The unemployment rate drops to 7.7%, down from 7.8% the previous quarter. The number of people in work, both full-time and part-time, reached a record high of 29.87 million in the quarter, up 155,000. The ONS looks at demand for full-time work and whether part-time workers would rather work longer hours. It said almost 1.5 million people were part-time because they could not find full-time jobs, the highest figure since records began in 1992. The unemployment rate has become a key economic indicator for the Bank of England which, under its recently appointed new governor, Mark Carney, is targeting the unemployment rate. It says it will not consider raising interest rates from their record low of 0.5% until it falls to 7%. The ONS also reported average earnings rose by 0.8% in the year to August. The BBC's chief economics correspondent, Hugh Pym points out this increase in regular pay (excluding bonuses) equalled the lowest recorded in the history of this series. He adds that the fall of 0.1% in average earnings in the public sector over the year to August was the first time such a decrease had been recorded. There was a sharp difference in the number of men and women in part-time employment, with male part-timers increasing by 21,000 and women in part-time work falling by 13,000. But more women were finding full-time work than men, with male full-time employment up by 69,000 compared with a rise of 79,000 for women. Youth unemployment remains just below the one-million mark, with 958,000 unemployed 16 to 24-year-olds, down by 1,000 over the quarter. The number of people unemployed for more than a year fell by 15,000 to 900,000. Those without work for between six months to a year rose by 29,000 to 446,000, but there was a fall of 32,000 people unemployed for up to six months, leaving 1.1 million in that position. The worst affected areas in the UK were in Birmingham Ladywood where the unemployment rate stands at 11.4% and in West Belfast where it is 9.3%. The Prime Minister, David Cameron, said the figures were "good news". He added: "These are welcome figures. Of course, we all want to see living standards improve, and last year disposable income increased. But the way to deliver on living standards is to grow the economy, keep producing the jobs and cut people's taxes." The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, said Mr Cameron should admit that there was "a cost-of-living crisis in this country". Mr Miliband said: "Today's economic figures show a welcome fall in unemployment. They also show that prices have risen faster than wages and that is 39 out of 40 months that living standards have fallen since he became prime minister." The Institute of Directors (IoD) said the jobs data showed the recovery was "job-lite". The IoD's chief economist, Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: "Today's labour market figures are not surprising. Just as employment losses during the recession were lower than expected, so too are employment gains with recovery. This isn't a jobless recovery but it is a job-lite one." The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) gave a cautious welcome to the figures. Its chief economist, David Kern, said: "Although concerns remain over youth and long-term employment, the figures show that Britain's labour market is strong and flexible, and that the economy should record satisfactory growth in the third quarter. The large fall in inactivity is particularly pleasing, as more people are returning to the workforce and are looking for jobs." He added that he expected the unemployment rate to continue to fall steadily and that the 7% unemployment rate targeted by the Bank of England would be reached in the autumn of 2015, a year earlier than the Bank had indicated. </body>

      <title>Australia's surf firms making waves</title>
      <description>Surfing is a national pastime in Australia, which continues to sustain a significant community of small firms, as the BBC's Phil Mercer reports.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24517642</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70463000/jpg/_70463014_aus1afp.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>A century ago, Duke Kahanamoku, a majestic Hawaiian board rider, helped to ignite modern Australia's passion for surfing. His showboating exhibition on the waves at Freshwater Beach in Sydney is widely seen as the catalyst for a national obsession. Picked from a curious crowd, a teenage girl was given what was almost certainly Australia's first official surfing lesson by the man known simply as the Duke. Today, the same swells that barrel in from the Pacific Ocean continue to thrill and they now sustain a range of small businesses that feed the popular surf tourism industry. At nearby Manly Beach, a class of beginners is about to take to the water for the very first time. It's a hot day in spring, and conditions are perfect for novices - the breeze is light, the waves gentle and the tuition patient. "It's a tough sport. Surfing is very similar to golf - you never master it, there are always things you can learn," says Nick James, from Manly Surf School, which was founded in 1995 and has 20 full-time staff. It pays about 50,000 Australian dollars ($47,000; £29,600) per year to the local council for exclusive rights to operate on one of Sydney's most celebrated stretches of sand. A standard two-hour group lesson for an adult costs A$70, while children pay A$55. Mr James says that business is generally vibrant, but admits that, like the weather, things can be unpredictable. "It's challenging. We've got to pay licences to run our surf schools on the beaches. "It's a good business, but there are times when we're closed for a week due to the surf conditions." There are 35 licensed surf schools in New South Wales, the most populous state in Australia. The sport's regional governing body has estimated that surfing pumps more than A$500m into the state's economy. "The sport is becoming increasingly more attractive," says Mark Windon, chief executive of Surfing New South Wales. "It is becoming more mainstream. It is just going to get more popular. In the next 10 years, you'll probably see triple the growth that you've seen in the last 10." At Manly, the latest converts tentatively paddle out for their initial encounter with the breakers. They have limited success - boards suddenly become airborne, dumping their breathless passengers into the drink. But back they come for more, and herein lies the secret to surfing's success. For many, its magnetic appeal is irresistible, and what's hearty for the soul is also good for the bottom line, according to Stacey Randell, executive officer of the Manly Chamber of Commerce. "Our whole region is based on the water, and surfing is huge economically speaking, and the amount of visitors it brings in every year is vital to the businesses in this community. Everybody benefits from this culture," she says. Yet while wave riding in Australia has never been more popular, independent surfing shops are struggling to stay afloat in a highly competitive market. "It is not particularly an easy living for most surf shop owners. You'll find most of them are pressed pretty hard by the big corporates to sell specific merchandise and conform to corporate dictates," says Doug Booth, the Australian-born dean of the School of Physical Education, Sport and Exercise Sciences at the University of Otago in New Zealand. A couple of streets back from Manly's sun-drenched waterfront, Tim Hanrahan, the owner of the Aloha surf shop, unloads another consignment of high-end boards. I ask if his head is financially above water? "Just," he says, laughing. "I make OK money." "It's difficult. It's not an easy job. The profit margins particularly on the boards are quite low. I've seen a lot of competitors come and go. "There is a lot of tourism in Manly, but realistically you've got to have the locals behind you, too. That's what keeps you going through the quieter months." Surfing Australia estimates there are more than 2.5 million recreational board riders around the country. It is far beyond simply a sport, but a lifestyle and cultural phenomenon that tourists are keen to experience. "I've always wanted to surf," says Ashton Williams, an investment software worker from Mississippi in the United States, as he wades out of the ocean at the end of his lesson at Manly. "It's much tougher than I thought, but when you're finally gliding over the water it is one of the most peaceful things. It's pretty amazing." </body>

      <title>Nepalese airline taking off</title>
      <description>The BBC's Surendra Phuyal talks to Birendra Bahadur Basnet about growing a private airline in Nepal.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24513257</url>

      <body>What makes an entrepreneur? The BBC's Surendra Phuyal hears from Birendra Bahadur Basnet, a private-airline owner in Nepal, about the risks he took starting his business, and how he believes success can be achieved. He does not come from a family of business people. His father is a retired judge, his ancestors were farmers in eastern Nepal. But Birendra Bahadur Basnet, 49, is amongst Nepal's most successful entrepreneurs. He has carved a niche in the country's not-so-impressive aviation sector in just a few years. When he registered his airline, Buddha Air, and started operations in 1996, the business graduate from a Kathmandu university had only one aircraft that was purchased with a loan: a US-made Beechcraft 1900D. Nearly two decades later, he is is the proud owner of nine aircraft - three Beechcraft 1900, three ATR 42-320 and three ATR 72-500 aircraft. Basnet's Buddha Air fleet is the largest in Nepal's domestic sector. "When we obtained the loan of around NPR 70m (£442,000; $708,000) in 1996 to set up our business and purchase an aircraft, our friends and relatives and other people said we had gone mad," Basnet, says, smiling. "But we started doing good in aviation sector and we paid our loan after six years," he says, adding his airline business has grown almost ten-fold since then. When he started, he recalls Nepal's state-owned airline Royal Nepal Airlines was not particularly successful and the newly liberalised domestic aviation market was looking for stable players from the private sector. "That's precisely where we saw the gap and we jumped in," he says. "The market was competitive, but safety, reliability and comfort being our mantra, we succeeded in winning the trust of our customers and we have been adding aircraft, one after another to our fleet." Basnet's road to success has not been easy though; the biggest blow came in September 2011 when one of his Beechcraft crashed on a hill near Kathmandu while returning from an aborted Mount Everest sightseeing flight, killing 19 people. "We thought we were invincible, but that crash proved we were not," he said, tears welling up in his eyes. "We lost three of our great colleagues, several other people and the aircraft. "That was a very sad experience that we had, but that also helped us grow." After the crash, he says, the airline did a review of its flight safety mechanisms and other related procedures to ensure that Buddha Air's safety standards remain impeccable. "We thought people would choose other airlines after the crash, we were concerned," he says. "But that didn't affect our business. People - both Nepalis and foreigners - continued to love us." Every morning, Buddha Air attracts dozens of foreign tourists to Kathmandu airport for its early morning sightseeing flights to the Mount Everest region - it hosted former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan when he visited Nepal in 2001. Boasting Nepal's first private airline to have its own hangar within Kathmandu Airport premises, Buddha Air flies to major towns inside Nepal and connects the Indian city of Varanashi with Kathmandu. "We are the first private airline to fly outside Nepal," says Basnet, adding that he plans to take Buddha Air to other major cities in the Asia Pacific region in future to better facilitate connectivity for passengers flying into and out of Nepal. Buddha Air currently employs more than 700 people, offering them salaries between 150 dollars and thousands of dollars per month. "They are a mostly happy bunch of people," he says. "We are like a happy family, but still we need to make sure that everyone is looked after and content." His recipe for success remains this: "Don't multi-task, focus on your goal. Success is floating around, all you have to do is go and grab it. But again, you have to focus on what you want to do and what you want to achieve." </body>

      <title>Cooking up a successful food business</title>
      <description>UK ready meals boss Charlie Bigham talks about how he was inspired to set up his company, and how he grew it successfully.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24434154</url>
      <date>1381707185</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70398000/jpg/_70398329_vw.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Inspiration can often come from strange places. For UK ready meals boss Charlie Bigham it was being unable to sleep at the border between Iran and Pakistan. Mr Bigham was 28 years old at the time, and he and his then girlfriend were travelling from the UK to India by camper van. "It was very, very hot, and we were in a really tough place," he says. "I couldn't sleep, so I just laid there restlessly thinking about what I was going to do for a living when we got back home. "I decided there and then that I was going to set up a food business, and it was going to look a bit like this." Mr Bigham had previously worked as a management consultant in London, before he and his girlfriend quit their jobs to go travelling for nine months. His ambition was to set up his own company when they returned to the UK, and now he had his idea - he was going to establish a business that made upmarket ready meals. Mr Bigham was not going to let the fact that he had never worked in the food industry before put him off, and instead he decided he would quickly set about gaining the knowledge and skills he needed. And so upon his return to the UK he got a job at a delicatessen in London's fashionable Notting Hill area. "I've always been really interested in food, but I had no food industry experience, so I knew I had to get some cheese under my fingernails, so to speak," he says. He ended up spending almost four months at the deli, and at the same time did lots of research, and working on recipes. "It became clear that the idea of making meals which are then sold via shops was a very good idea for a business because it was a massive market, yet one which was very straightforward to start up in," says Mr Bigham. "I knew we could start under the radar before any bigger rivals could crush us, and then build quite quickly." In November 1996, 11 months after his return from travelling, and now married to his girlfriend, Mr Bigham launched the business with £25,000 of savings, calling it simply "Charlie Bigham's". To begin with, it was just him and one chef based at a small facility in London's Park Royal business estate. Mr Bigham says: "We had just three product lines to start with - zesty Caribbean lamb, Cajun chicken with salsa, and salmon with a dill and cream sauce. I think we made just 20 meals in total in that first week." To get sales moving, Mr Bigham, now 47, says he simply started "knocking on people's doors". "I went round all the posh delis in London, and the big department stores with food halls. Everyone was approachable, and said, 'Yeah we'll give you a go'. "I just had to be mildly persuasive, and I'm not a salesman. "What greatly helped us, is that you have to remember that at the time, most ready - or convenience - meals, as I prefer to call them, were pretty dreadful. "We were one of the first to make quality ones without anything artificial. This set us apart and made shops interested in stocking us." But while selling to posh stores in London was pleasing, Mr Bigham realised that in order to grow the business he needed to win a contract with one of the UK's supermarket groups. And so he cold-called Waitrose. "I just picked up the phone and rang the Waitrose switchboard. I managed to persuade a lovely woman on the phone to put me through to a buyer. I got a meeting, and the buyer said she would give us a go." Charlie Bigham's meals have been stocked by Waitrose ever since, initially at 40 stores for a successful trial period, and then nationwide. Online supermarket Ocado, and Booths, the north of England supermarket chain, have since followed suit. The company now employs 200 people across two sites at the Park Royal business park, and has an annual turnover of £20m, which is now growing at 19% per annum. Mr Bigham says his former job as a management consultant helped him manage the company's growth over the past 17 years. But he is the first to admit that luck and good timing played a major role in his success. "The only way you can ever set up a successful business is to be lucky," he says. "It is the thing you need more than anything else. Anyone who says otherwise is just lying." Mr Bigham says that most important piece of luck was all to do with timing. "I set up a food business just as interest in food was blossoming in this country. Suddenly there was a wealth of TV chefs, and the national newspapers all added food sections at weekends. "And the supermarkets were all being brave and looking outwards towards new suppliers. There was no planning or forethought about all this on my part, it was pure luck." Mr Bigham today gives himself the job title "chairman and creative director". This followed his decision back in 2010 to bring in someone else to handle the chief executive role. "It has enabled me to focus on the bits of the business I'm really interested in - product development, and the big strategic picture - working out plans for the next three to five years," he says. "The bit in the middle [the day-to-day financial decisions etc] I'm easily bored by, and is best done by someone else." Looking ahead, Mr Bigham says the company has no plans to start exporting, because the freshness, and therefore limited shelf life of his products, makes it too expensive. Nor does he ever intend to move production away from London to somewhere cheaper, because he says he is loyal to his hard-working staff. "I'm proud of what we have done to date, but I'm in no way complacent. Owning your own business is a hugely privileged position to be in, because I work with people I have chosen - not many people can say that." </body>

      <body>Italian football club Inter Milan has become the latest European club to be taken over by foreign investors. A trio of Indonesian businessmen led by media tycoon Erick Thohir have bought a 70% stake in the club. The club did not disclose the value of deal, but various reports estimated it to be between 250m - 300m euros ($340m; £210m - $405m; £250m). The two sides had been negotiating for some time amid efforts by the club to bring in fresh capital. Massimo Moratti, the president of the club, said the club's "history is going to be enriched by a new season thanks to our new international partners who, I am sure, will contribute to a continued string of successes". "The new partners' enthusiasm and pragmatism are certainly a guarantee for the future," he added in a statement. Mr Thohir is also a co-owner of DC United, a Major League Soccer club in the US and has also served as vice president of the Indonesian Olympic Committee. The other two partners in the deal are Rosan Roeslani and Handy Soetedjo. Mr Roeslani also owns a stake in DC United, while Mr Soetedjo was involved in the purchase of basketball team Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 2011. </body>

      <title>Evans to give up Pirates ownership</title>
      <description>Cornish Pirates owner Dicky Evans is to stand down at the end of the season, but will continue to help fund the team.</description>

      <body>Cornish Pirates owner Dicky Evans has announced plans to step aside at the end of the season, but insists he will continue to help finance the team. The 67-year-old plans to sell 150 shares in the club and has committed to providing £400,000 in funding on a two-year rolling basis. The businessman has been involved at the Pirates since 1994. "We need to alter the ownership of the club in readiness for the next push as I'm not getting younger," said Evans. In a lengthy statement on the Cornish Pirates website,   Evans laid out his vision for the future of the club over the next few years and explained his decision to change the ownership model. "I have to think of my family for a change, four people who have been incredibly supportive of me," he added. "I intend to step aside, not down, at the end of the season as the owner of the company and hand over ownership to the many superb friends and supporters who follow the team. "Consequently, over the next eight months to the end of this current financial year we need to develop a plan to enable friends and supporters of the Cornish Pirates worldwide to take ownership through a basic share issue format. "They will be taking over a company clear of all loans and debt - paying a nominal £1 for the whole shareholding." The Pirates have risen up the leagues to the Championship during Evans' time at the club, but have so far found the ultimate prize of a place in the Premiership frustratingly out of reach. Evans said the need to move to a stadium in a more central location in Cornwall - ideally in Truro - was a key hurdle for the club to clear in order to progress and increase their fanbase. The pursuit of a larger stadium in Truro has been a long-running issue for the Pirates, who are currently based at Mennaye Field in Penzance in the far south-west of the county. The club have led a nomadic existence in recent seasons having played at Kenwyn near Truro and at Camborne during the last decade. "This is the next major step in securing our future," added Evans. "The stadium will come eventually and it's essential that the Cornish Pirates are in a position to move to the centre of Cornwall and consolidate on the business and spectator support available there, witnessed by the year we spent at Kenwyn - our most successful year at this level financially. "The rugby will be of the highest calibre possible within the budget constraints that are always with us and the party atmosphere will continue both home and away. "Cornish people deserve a top-class sporting team and venue - we have the ability to produce the former and as each obstacle to a stadium is surmounted there is no doubt that will come. "The Pirates are a vital part of this dream - let's not let it go down the tubes." Evans also plans to offer some "iconic players" and coaches Ian Davies and Harvey Biljon long-term contracts until the end of the 2015-16 season as part of a commitment to working closely with the wider Cornish rugby community. "Hopefully we can work with the senior Cornish clubs such as Redruth and Launceston to provide our qualified coaches on an almost full-time basis," he said. "At the same time we can work with these clubs to lend them Pirates squad players. "And there is no reason why other players with coaching qualifications cannot work with other Cornish clubs at no salary cost to that club. "We have a deep squad this year and will continue to target all competitions. Once we have decided and agreed which players we think will make the grade we will commence negotiations and we will be cutting our cloth to suit. "Our budget funds next season should be sufficient to enable us retain a very competitive side." </body>

      <title>Rangers forced to postpone their AGM</title>
      <description>Rangers' annual meeting is delayed after shareholders seeking changes to the club's board won a court decision.</description>

      <body>Rangers have been forced to postpone their 24 October annual meeting after shareholders seeking changes at board level won a court decision. Lord Tyre granted an interim interdict at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, preventing the AGM from going ahead. Rangers had said there was not enough time for four directors nominated by shareholders to be put up for election. But the group said Rangers had broken the law by failing to ensure the motion was on the agenda. It is the latest development in a battle for control of the Scottish League One leaders. The group wants Malcolm Murray, who was club chairman until April, Paul Murray, who was a director until last year, director of Loch Lomond Golf Club Scott Murdoch and Alex Wilson, a former HR director with BT, to be appointed to the board. Paul Murray told BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme : "Today was all about shareholder democracy. We wanted to put in front of the shareholders, the fans and the other stakeholders of the club the ability to have a democratic vote at the AGM. "We submitted four nominations on 27 September. Those have been shown today to have been perfectly valid legal notices. "The club's board chose to ignore those notices and issue an AGM notice that is flawed and set a date of 24 October that is now having to be rearranged." "I think both [chief executive] Craig Mather and [finance director] Brian Stockbridge have to seriously consider their positions tonight because I think they are untenable. "The board chose to tie us up in all sorts of legal mechanisms that were reported today in court and we've been vindicated." Richard Keen QC, representing the shareholder group, accused the club of engaging in "guerrilla warfare" in its battle to prevent a group of shareholders from joining the Ibrox board. He told Lord Tyre the directors of the club had "committed an offence" by not informing other shareholders of the requisition. "An offence has been committed by every member of this board," Keen said. "The board have placed themselves in a very difficult situation by failing to discharge their statutory obligations. They have committed an offence. "If I am right, the consequences of that must be visited upon them." Mather and his fellow board members have been sued by the requisitioners. The current Rangers board has so far blocked the attempts at change, claiming the application was not properly authenticated and that it did not arrive on time. Keen claimed the signatures requested by the board had been offered "timeously" before adding: "These requests have been sent by the relevant companies and, on the face of it, there is no reason to doubt their validity." However, Heriot Currie QC, representing the board of Rangers International Football Club, told Lord Tyre: "The petitioners have known since 12 September that they had to organise themselves for a shareholder meeting by no later than 30 October." The Murrays, along with shareholders Ian Cormack, John Graham and Colin Howell, made requests in writing to Rangers International Football Club plc to give notice to members of the resolutions to appoint new directors at the AGM on 27 September. They maintained they had enough support from institutional shareholders to take them over the key threshold of 5% of the total voting rights to allow such a move. Currie said there was no obligation on the part of the company to circulate the resolutions and claimed documents and related information were supplied that at the very least raised "very significant doubt" over three of the backers of the move making valid requisitions. Rangers must re-arrange their AGM to be held before the end of December and must give shareholders at least 21 days' notice. They say they will fix a new date "as soon as possible" with the requisitioners' business included, but they have defended their decision to initially oppose the notices. Following the Court of Session decision, Rangers issued a statement on their website  : "The board of directors of the company received clear and firm advice from its solicitors and senior and junior counsel that on the face of documents provided by the petitioners, the notices had not been signed in a manner that was authorised and as a result the directors were obliged to seek further clarification from those shareholders. "Every effort was made to engage with the petitioners on these issues. However, the petitioners chose to resolve the matter in court. In Lord Tyre's opinion, these irregularities did not invalidate the notices." </body>

A dispute about pay and pensions has caused the closure and owners Ineos say they are being held to ransom by the union. The union says the company is behaving badly. Tom Crotty, a director of Ineos, told the Today programme: "The reason we had the plant closed is that Unite served notice that they were going to strike, which they then called off.

      <body>When Sir Stuart Rose says something on retail, it's worth listening. With a 40-year track record in the industry, the former chief executive and chairman of Marks and Spencer is famed for turning around struggling retailers. Now an independent, non-executive director at South Africa's Woolworths Holdings, a chain of shops selling fashion, food, beauty and home ware, he says retail has changed. "Where the customer used to be king before, the customer is now the master of the universe: and they want what they want, how they want it, when they want it." For Woolworths, this shift has been felt most keenly in clothing - an area that along with beauty and home ware makes up 38% of its business in South Africa. In response, over the past two to three years it has made a conscious effort to make its clothing more fashionable, which crucially has involved getting it from the design stage to the shop floor much more quickly. "Previously it was 11-months-plus for all of our clothing products to the point now where we can turn [an item] around in 90 days," says Ian Moir, chief executive of Woolworths (which has no connection with the former British High Street chain of the same name). The strategy appears to be working. The company's most recent results for the year to the end of June saw clothing sales grow by 13.7%. "If we don't give the customer the trend, the colour, the fashion they're looking for, at the end of the day they're going to go somewhere else," says Mr Moir. Neil Saunders, managing director at retail consultancy Conlumino, says the changes at Woolworths reflect a "sea change" in how supermarket groups sell clothing. "They have become more like clothing retailers. Five years ago they used to merchandise it in the same way as, for example, baked beans. They piled it high and sold it cheap. But now they have become lifestyle rather than commodity-led." Mr Saunders says the 2008 financial crisis and resulting recession is a key reason behind this change in approach, with a trend for people to choose quality items that they expect to last. "Before the recession people bought lots of stuff... they even bought stuff they didn't wear. There was a disposable element because clothing was cheap and people felt affluent. "People are more frugal now. They buy less stuff and follow the ethos of, 'If you buy it right you buy it once.'" Mr Saunders says, however, that low prices can still lure in customers if they are combined with fashion, citing Primark as an example. "It's on trend and that makes people very interested. But if a retailer just chases value then they struggle," he adds. UK supermarket group Sainsbury's founded its clothing range Tu almost a decade ago. James Brown, clothing business director at Sainsbury's, says when Tu began it was focused on core products such as leggings, jogging bottoms and T-shirts, with ranges changed every 12 weeks or longer. But in the past two years it has become more trend-led. "Since our recent rebrand the new Tu range is refreshed every six weeks to keep up with the latest fashions, and offer new products to our customer," says Mr Brown. "Over the last nine years we have learnt more about our broad customer base and have adapted the range to offer more High Street-style garments at supermarket prices to meet customer demand," he adds. The approach seems to be working - at its recent trading update for the 16 weeks to 28 September it said its general merchandise and clothing business grew at more than twice the rate of its food business. Mr Brown says new items are planned up to seven months in advance, but that it can react quickly to last-minute trends by turning around a style in just eight weeks, assuming it can get the necessary fabric and has the production capacity. In contrast, for High Street chain Zara, production capacity is rarely an issue because unusually its owner Inditex has its own factories. These manufacture what it says is a "significant share" of its clothing for its eight brands, which include upmarket Massimo Dutti and teen label Bershka, but primarily the most fashionable garments. For those items the clothes can be produced and in store in a rapid two to three weeks. "Customer expectations are higher than ever so our capability to adapt and react to their demands is one of our key strengths," says an Inditex source. For Ian Moir, this is the key to Woolworths' future. "The importance of fashion is becoming greater and greater and customer awareness is getting better and better. "They're very fashion aware and they want it now. That's the way the world is going, it's the way it's changing and it's the way we've got to change as a business."

      <title>Energy bills: Where does my money go?</title>
      <description>Where does my money go?</description>

      <body>Ed Miliband has pledged that gas and electricity bills will not go up for 20 months if Labour wins the 2015 election. The promise, made in his speech at the party's annual conference, has stoked up a debate over energy prices and their justification. So where exactly does customers' money go and what might be the effect of a price freeze? How much do we pay? The average annual dual-fuel bill - covering gas and electricity - is £1,315 per household. This figure, published by regulator Ofgem in mid-September, is based on the latest assumption of the amount of energy a typical household uses. Bear in mind, this is an average. The amount you pay depends on your energy consumption and the method of payment. It is one of the largest regular bills that a household has to pay, behind mortgage or rent, and council tax. Prices have risen in recent years, and analysts predict another increase in the coming weeks. Do people in other countries pay more or less? As with many aspects of this sector, the answer is not simple. The Department of Energy and Climate Change has had a crack at a comparison, but data for countries including Belgium, Italy and Sweden is unavailable. These figures show that average domestic electricity prices in the UK, including taxes, last year were the fourth lowest among 15 EU countries, and the fourth highest among the G7 group of nations. For gas, domestic prices in the UK in 2012 were the second lowest among the 15 EU counties that were compared, and the third lowest in the G7. Households in the US benefited from the lowest prices for both gas and electricity. How much of my bill ends up as the energy firms' profits? The argument over whether the major energy suppliers' profits are "excessive" is central to this debate. The regulator has been collecting data on these firms' profit margins for the past three years. The latest statistics, from mid-September, show that the average profit margin made on the £1,315 bill is £65. This was £30 higher than September 2011 and September 2012. However, it is worth bearing in mind that this is a snapshot and the figure has been volatile. In some months, the profit margin has risen above £100, whereas in others the margin has been negative. Ofgem says that seasonal factors are key to this volatility. Where does the rest of the money go? By far the biggest chunk of your bill goes on the cost of buying gas and electricity on the wholesale market, or directly from an electricity generator or gas supplier. This, in addition to the costs of running a retail business with billing and sales, accounts for 67% of a gas bill and 58% of an electricity bill, according to Ofgem. But this is where the figures get really complicated. Wholesale gas and electricity is not a single product but a whole series of contracts. Each company's team of traders will be buying energy at different prices, depending on whether this is delivered tomorrow, next month, or even in five years' time. They spread out the purchases of energy to mitigate the risk of volatility when, for example, there is unrest in an oil-producing region. OK, and what else does my bill cover? About 16% of it goes on distribution charges - the cost of the gas pipes and electricity wires that get the energy into your home. The cost of high pressure gas and high voltage transmission networks account for 2% of a gas bill and 4% of an electricity bill. VAT accounts for 5% of each. A bit goes on costs of metering and storing gas. Then, 6% of a gas bill and 11% of an electricity bill go to government schemes aimed at saving energy, reducing emissions and tackling climate change. It is these "green" fees that the energy suppliers say have pushed up the cost of a typical bill in recent years. What might be the effect of a price freeze? Some of the energy companies, and those who represent them, argue that the lights could go out if prices cannot be changed for nearly two years. In reality, we will not be plunged into darkness. What they mean is that the decommissioning of coal - and ultimately nuclear - power plants, is going to create a shortfall in energy production in the UK. If they are going to build new power production plants, such as wind farms or power stations, huge amounts of investment are needed. An inability to set prices would affect this long-term strategy. In response, Ed Miliband says that firms have been "overcharging" customers for many years. Consumer groups say a price freeze would be popular, but there would be hurdles in making such a policy work. Can the regulator step in if prices are pushed up ahead of the general election? No, Ofgem has no control of the prices that companies charge their customers. Instead, a supplier might find that it is undercut by other firms if it puts up prices significantly, leading customers to switch. If all firms do the same, this competition argument is weakened. However, Ed Miliband says he would take action if prices went up sharply before the election, if Labour formed the next government. What else might it mean for competition? It could affect new, smaller businesses trying to get into the market. They would be unable to change prices, leading to more volatility in terms of profits. Open4Energy, one of only a handful of new suppliers licensed by Ofgem, has already said that it would pull out of the UK if a price freeze looked like becoming policy. How can I save money on my bill now? There are various ways to save money on your energy bill, if you are a homeowner or a tenant. They include looking for better deals and switching suppliers if needs be, especially if you have been on the same tariff for a long time. Paying by direct debit, and receiving bills online can also reduce costs for those currently paying by cheque every quarter. </body>

      <title>Why tech women need a makeover</title>
      <description>How to attract girls to the tech industry</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24537621</url>

      <body>Anne-Marie Imafidon is in a rush to get on with life. Perhaps that is why she passed a GCSE in computer science aged 10, became the youngest graduate to attain a masters degree, aged 19, and is already planning the future of her unborn children. And if daughters come along she is clear that she doesn't want them to "feel like the odd ones out," if they decide, like her, to pursue a career in technology. As a self-confessed stubborn woman, she hopes she can succeed where others have failed - in reducing the huge gap between girls and boys studying so-called Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths. To do this, she has set up Stemettes, which she runs when she isn't in her day job at a global investment bank. She was one of just three girls in a class of 70 studying maths and computer science at university. "At the time I wasn't that bothered, I just thought it was part and parcel of studying computer science," she says. "But then last year I spoke at a conference and I heard that the numbers of women in technology was in decline and I thought, 'That isn't right.' "Technology is at the forefront of the economy and women have a vital role to play. When my daughters are born I don't want them to feel like the odd ones out." The UK has a massive skills gap. Only 17% of the UK's tech jobs are held by women. In Stem subjects generally women make up just 13% of the workforce. In engineering women fare even worse, taking up just 8% of the jobs. So where does it all go wrong? At secondary school, girls are as likely as boys to study Stem subjects, at least up to GCSE, but for A-levels and beyond, female representation drops off dramatically. And among girls who carry on and study science at university, two out of three don't go on to Stem-related careers. The reasons for the drop-off in interest are multiple, thinks Ms Imafidon. "Some schools, often girl-only schools, simply don't offer ICT [information and communications technology] at A-level and the girls wanting to do it have to go to a nearby boys school to learn it," she says. "In other schools, computer science often clashes with things like drama or music, meaning the girls can't do both. If every other girl is doing drama, you'd want to be in a class with all your friends rather than take the difficult route and do computer science." Girls are very aware that their choice of A-level subjects impacts what they study at university and which one they go to. It means that girls tend to choose "safe" subjects that they know they will get a good grade in, according to Ms Imafidon. "Choosing computer science is an unnecessarily tough choice and one you aren't going to make unless you are one of the stubborn girls like I was," she says. It isn't like that everywhere. Brazil punches above its weight, ranking highest overall in the representation of women in science and technology, according to a report from Women in Global Science and Technology. Much of that is down to programmes that support women in the workforce, good funding for education and research and support of female entrepreneurship. South Africa and India also score well. For Ms Imafidon, it is because ITC has a very different image and status in these countries. "In India if you go into technology, it is because you want to do well and get ahead in life. If you see a well-dressed women walking down the street, you don't ask is she a lawyer or a banker but is she working in IT," she says. The aim of Stemettes and other sister organisations is to replicate in the West what is happening in the developing world. To facilitate that, the group runs events around the country aimed at getting girls interested in technology. Girls are introduced to a range of women already working in Stem subjects and are invited to take part in events such as hackathons. "We get them making mobile apps, data visualisations, having fun," says Ms Imafidon. The fact that they can do all this surrounded by other girls makes them more confident. "Coding clubs are dominated by boys. We want to make our club as normal for girls as ballet," says Ms Imafidon. At the end of the month the group will host a hackathon in Oxford, and in November it is running an exhibition at the Crystal in London's docklands. Girls aged from seven to 22 will be invited to take a variety of workshops, including dance and science, 3D printing and one on nuclear substances. The goal of Stemettes and its sister organisations is to get the women in the Stem workforce up to 30% by 2020. When you consider that women began coding 200 years ago, it seems like a fairly realistic ambition. This week saw the annual Ada Lovelace day, which every year celebrates the achievements of the Victorian woman credited with writing the first piece of code for Charles Babbage's analytical engine. The fact that Mrs Lovelace was coding in an age when even few men were, shows that there is no inherent aptitude problem, thinks Ms Imafidon. "It isn't that girls can't do it, it is that they are choosing not to do it," she says. "She was doing it 200 years ago so we have no excuse." </body>

      <title>Taiwan's older students</title>
      <description>Can the elderly save Taiwan's universities?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24566388</url>
      <date>1382051878</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70542000/jpg/_70542842_old.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Every night after dinner, many of Taiwan's older people go out to nearby parks to chat with their neighbours, or stay home to watch TV and play with the grandchildren - but not 62-year-old Yu Chin-shan. He takes his briefcase full of books and notebooks, and goes to college. The semi-retired Mr Yu owns an IT services company and has been a boss for 20 years. But now he wants to fulfil a dream he couldn't afford when he was younger. "I didn't go to college when I was young because my family didn't have the money. So I started working and eventually started a business. But I found there were many things about business management that I still wanted to learn," said Mr Yu. He is among a new wave of older people going to college for either short-term classes or degrees as Taiwan's life expectancy increases and the population ages. In 2008, Taiwan's government began offering subsidised university courses for older people, as a way to help them live more active lives. At first, older people had to be persuaded to attend college. Now they bring their friends and travel from other cities to take classes ranging from healthcare to history and law. This year, 100 universities in Taiwan have offered these courses and the older student population has shot up from about 800 in 2008 to more than 3,000 today. This is happening as many of Taiwan's 160 universities are facing declining enrolment from younger students. At Taipei's China University of Science and Technology, the student population has dropped by several hundred this year. The university had 10,000 students a few years ago, but is now down to about 9,000. Universities, who must compete for the shrinking number of students, fear that some will have to close in the coming years if the trend continues. The university blames the decline on Taiwan's low birth rate. Many young people are delaying getting married, not marrying at all, or are having fewer children or none at all. Meanwhile the island's universal health care system, which provides medical care to 99% of the population at relatively low costs for patients, is also improving health and prolonging the lives of Taiwan's people. The average lifespan in Taiwan has reached 80 years. As early as 2016, Taiwan's 65-and-overs will outnumber those under the age of 14 for the first time. By 2060, four in every 10 people on the island will be 65 or older. Tien Chen-jung, president of the China University of Science and Technology, says some institutions, including his own, are hoping to attract more older students - many of whom never had the chance to go to college, or even secondary school back in the days when Taiwan was still a developing economy. "We feel this is a huge market," Mr Tien said. "Many elderly people don't want to just stay at home all day. They have a thirst to learn. We've found that with the right programmes and good teachers, they are very happy to take classes here, and we believe they will even pay full tuition to get a degree." Enrolment among older people has increased by about 25% a year over the past few years, with nearly 1,000 enrolling last year. After taking the subsidised classes, Mr Yu became even more interested in learning. This year, he enrolled for a degree in enterprise management. "Some people might think it's too late for me to go to college, but I think it's never too late to learn. I believe in the saying, 'Live until we reach old age, learn even after we've reached old age,'" he said. "I think lifelong learning is very important. It keeps our mind active and strong." For his bachelor degree programme, Mr Yu even has to take general education courses, like his younger classmates. That includes sports. In a school gymnasium full of young students playing table tennis one night, he's clearly the only one with gray hair. But although he hasn't played in 40 years, he returns his opponent's serves almost every time. He's not only keeping up in this and other classes, he's doing better than some of his younger classmates. That's perhaps a sign of what's to come, for Taiwan's rapidly ageing society. </body>

      <description>Rwanda targets knowledge economy with tech revolution</description>

      <body>Olive Uwineza is 12 years old and dreams of becoming president one day. She sits in a class of about 30 pupils, at a high-tech primary school in Kigali, Rwanda. Each student has a green, white and orange laptop that uses cartoon animations to make lessons more fun. A lover of maths and science, Olive says tackling these subjects without computers "can make my lessons difficult". Five years ago, an initiative called One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) was introduced to the school, led by the government and NGOs. It has seen 200,000 laptops distributed in more than 400 schools across this tiny east African nation. Facilities at Olive's school have been upgraded and modernised, with access to wi-fi, and software tailored for the curriculum. The OLPC programme is one of the pillars of Rwanda's Vision 2020, which aims to turn the country into a knowledge-based economy similar to that of Singapore in South East Asia. In the wood-panelled halls of his official office, we meet President Paul Kagame, who has personally been a driver of this vision. He says information technology will help to turn Rwanda into a regional tech hub that will help Rwandans "find jobs, feed their children and regain their dignity". The tragedy of the 1994 genocide is a strong motivation for President Kagame. In his view, better access to information might have helped victims and perpetrators make different political choices. For him, the IT revolution is not only about modernising the Rwandan economy - at the core, it's about healing the nation. Mr Kagame has presided over an era of robust growth in Rwanda. Last year, the economy grew by more than 7%. Government reforms have encouraged foreign investment and the World Bank has ranked Rwanda the third best country in sub-Saharan Africa in its "Doing Business" index. But all of this could be undermined by the recent diplomatic tensions with donors. Rwanda has been accused of helping train child soldiers for rebels in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, though it has strongly rejected the allegations. In October, the US imposed sanctions on Rwanda, which may have an impact on the government's ability to pursue future economic programmes that support Vision 2020. Undeterred, government agencies continue with their work. Clare Akamanzi is the chief executive of the Rwanda Development Board, tasked with turning Vision 2020 into tangible social programmes. She says Rwanda aspires to "evolve from being an agriculture-based economy to a knowledge-based economy, mainly on high value services". In 2013 a deal was concluded with Korea Telecom to provide 4G technology across the country. At $140m (£87m) this is one of the biggest foreign direct investment deals in Rwanda. The state has laid 3,000km of fibre-optic cables over the last four years and hopes that 4G will help provide last-mile access to all communities outside of the capital, where internet connectivity is low. Clare Akamanzi says they are taking additional steps to ensure this happens. "We've built tele-centres, we've built service points, there's a communal infrastructure where we've put computers," she says. "We've also used ICT buses where we take mobile buses all over the country so people can just come and learn how to use a computer." But new technology isn't working for everyone. At a grain market on the outskirts of Kigali, traders are buying sorghum from local farmers. A mobile phone application called e-Soko was given to farmers in 2007. The app is designed to save farmers time and help them find the best deal, by sending automated text messages with the latest market prices. The farmers here, though, say they still prefer the more traditional method of face-to-face bartering. "When I call with my phone there's that possibility of an interaction," farmer Jean Baptiste Nzabamwita says. "We can bargain and say come, we can raise the price up to this one. But [with] the e-Soko... the prices are not reliable." This is just one small example of how society can sometimes resist the changes brought about by IT. Rwanda is still a largely traditional and rural country, therefore attempts to modernise the economy will have to go apace with the needs of the population at large. So does President Kagame's IT agenda come at the expense of more practical realities like healthcare, housing and rural development? His answer is simple: "The proof of the pudding is in the eating…. and we've been rewarded by progress." </body>

      <title>How bad are US debt levels?</title>
      <description>How does the US compare with other major economies?</description>

      <body>Taken out of context, the numbers are staggering. The US has a total debt pile of almost $17 trillion (£10.6 trillion), which is expected to rise to almost $23tn in the next five years. But how does that compare with other major economies? Japan is not far behind, with current debts totalling $11.5tn. By any standards, these are big, big numbers. And these countries are not alone - almost every major global economy has debts of more than a trillion dollars, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But context is needed - after all, debt is not necessarily a problem if you have the income to cover it. That is why the two most common measures used to gauge a nation's indebtedness are: Some governments actually run a surplus - in other words their income exceeds their expenses. Running a surplus is one of the best ways to reduce overall levels of debt. Looking at debt-to-GDP tells us that total US debt is roughly equivalent to its annual economic output. It is by far the largest economy in the world, and has the largest debt pile. Japan is the world's third largest economy, but its huge pile of debt is more than double its GDP. The only other country whose debts outstrip economic output is Italy, although a number of others come close - namely the UK, France and Canada. Even Germany, traditionally seen as fiscally responsible, has a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 80%. Much of this debt has been accumulated over the long term, but the numbers have rocketed in recent years as governments have struggled to cope with the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent recessions that have ravaged almost all major economies. Banking bailouts, economic stimulus measures and falling tax revenues have all forced governments to borrow more. For example, in 2007, the UK's debt pile was just 44% of GDP compared with 88% last year. This reflects in part the country's large financial sector relative to its overall economy. The US's debt-to-GDP ratio in 2007 was 64%, the same as France and Germany. By contrast, the debt-to-GDP ratio in China and India, which have seen economic slowdowns but no recession, has not moved significantly over the past five years, nor is it set to deteriorate in the next five. Indeed in the case of China, it is set to fall significantly. The picture elsewhere is less encouraging. The IMF estimates that Germany aside, those countries with high levels of indebtedness will struggle to reduce debt levels in the coming years. The UK, where the government has made much of reducing debt levels, will actually see the debt ratio edge towards 100% of GDP. One reason for this is governments' inability to move from an annual deficit to a surplus. In other words, an inability to live within their means. The IMF estimates that only Australia and China of the world's 12 largest economies will move into surplus by 2018, while Germany will increase its surplus further. Russia, it thinks, will move from a surplus to a deficit. However, most major economies are expected to make good progress in reducing their deficits. </body>

      <title>Impact of a Royal Mail strike?</title>
      <description>Contingencies and opportunity during a postal strike</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24551650</url>

      <body>A nationwide strike of Royal Mail workers is to go ahead, says the Communication Workers Union, after its members voted four-to-one in favour of industrial action. The last time national strikes by postal workers were seen in the UK was in 2009, when a series of walkouts led to widespread disruption. It was estimated that in the first wave of nationwide strikes in 2009, there was a backlog of 30-60 million pieces of post. In the second wave, the backlog was of more than 50 million. It was also reported that some businesses suffered heavy losses, orders were unfulfilled, staff were unpaid, and some were even laid off. So what will the impact be now, in 2013? The context of the postal service has changed. In the past four years competition has boomed, and while any disruption to the six-day-a-week universal service will be unwelcome to many, this time a lot of businesses have already made other plans. Federation of Small Businesses national chairman John Allan is urging his members to start preparing now to avoid a hit on their revenues. "We would encourage businesses to look at contingency plans," he says. "Ultimately, those firms reliant on using the postal service to deliver goods will be put at a disadvantage, with consequential negative impact on their bottom lines." A glance at the websites of online retail giants such as Asos will reveal statements reassuring customers that in the event of a strike, parcels will be directed to other service providers. Amazon, the Royal Mail's biggest single business customer, said in a statement on Wednesday: "If one of our carriers was unable to provide delivery services at any time, we would employ contingency plans which include routing orders through our other carriers." These other carriers have boomed in the past few years - from UK Mail to TNT, DX Exchange, and the likes of Hermes and Yodel. Some of Royal Mail's competitors were even established, says former postal regulator executive Stephen Gibson, of SLG Economics, because of previous industrial action. "The difference really between the strikes of the recent past and now is that there is more competition now," he says. "Previous strikes became a market opportunity for companies, and after winning that business, they've kept it." David Stubbs, a postal economist, agrees that a lot has changed in the world of deliveries since 2009. He says that competitors have proved themselves reliable, especially for businesses who were reliant on the Royal Mail, such as many eBay companies. However, he says, for smaller companies, strikes could cause real problems, especially given the timing. "If there were to be more strikes, leading up to Christmas, there would be real issues," he says. "Royal Mail processes almost double the volume in December over a normal month. "For the big retailers, they will have already got other plans in place, and they will have contracts with competitor companies. However, it will be disruptive. Those competitors are already straining with deliveries." He adds that some services, such as TNT, may look to expand their network. "There is a potential that alternative postal companies may expand their end-to-end delivery networks - TNT might try and deliver more to the home," he says. "But there is some uncertainty around what Ofcom [which regulates the sector] would do in that situation - the regulator has threatened to impose universal service conditions on competing mail providers." Andrew Starkey, the head of e-logistics at IMRG, the body that represents the UK's online retailers says that more choice in service has also been matched by a surge in the volume of parcels delivered, so taking on more business contracts will be a problem. "Royal Mail has been the default carrier of choice along with the post office network while the online shopping sector has developed, and though more competition has come into the market, there is also a lot more volume," he says. He says that by the end of 2013 there will be an estimated 1.24 billion online orders generated by UK retailers and eBay traders. "There are tens of millions more orders this year than last from online retails and Royal Mail carries about 50% of them," he says. That figure rises to 90% for returns, Mr Starkey adds. "If Royal Mail goes down everything creaks." Yet Mr Starkey says that the alternative network can cope with a one-day strike. "If it's more frequent, or a week-long stoppage, then that's a problem," he says. However, he and postal economist David Stubbs agree that the increasing popularity of "click and collect", whereby online orders are collected by the customer at a local shop, will ease congestion for parcel deliveries. Mr Starkey adds: "This came into its own in the very bad snow of 2010. It caught on from that point, and for small retailers who don't have this in their own stores, their networks have grown. "There are about 12,000 outlets now. That's about the same number as there are Post Offices anyway." </body>

      <body>A woman has died after a house fire in Rhondda Cynon Taf in which the property had partly collapsed, said the fire service. Firefighters tackled the blaze in Abernant, Aberdare, for three hours from shortly after 07:30 BST. South Wales Police said the cause of the fire was unknown and was under investigation. The force said next of kin had been informed and were being supported "at this difficult time". "A body believed to be that of a female has been found inside the property but has not been formally identified," said South Wales Police in a statement. "Next of kin have been informed and are being supported at this difficult time. "A police cordon will remain overnight." South Wales Fire and Rescue Service officers are also investigating. Assistant chief fire officer Andy Thomas said crews had been faced with a "difficult" rescue attempt. "Despite the tremendous efforts of the fire crews, the severity of the fire and the partial collapse of the building meant crews were faced with a very difficult incident and, unfortunately, a fatality has been confirmed at the scene," he said. He added: "I would first of all like to express my sincere condolences to the family and friends of the deceased that has sadly lost their life during the house fire today." He said he could not give any further information on the identity of the person who had died. South Wales fire service said five appliances and two water bowsers had attended the scene. A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesperson said: "We were called at 7.41am to reports of a fire at a property in Aberdare. "We sent two rapid response vehicles, two emergency ambulances and the hazardous area response team to the scene, where sadly one person was pronounced dead." </body>

      <body>A 48-year-old woman who stole 905 designer handbags over a three-year period has been jailed for 18 months. Jayne Rand, from Swindon in Wiltshire, carried out a nationwide "campaign of shoplifting" and took handbags and purses worth up to £135,000. She was eventually caught at a shopping centre in Cwmbran, south Wales. Her haul, Newport Crown Court heard, included bags made by Mulberry, Prada, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Dior and Burberry valued at up to £200 each. Rand sold some of the bags on online auction site eBay. She is known to have made £88,000 in sales from the stolen bags but their retail value would have been closer to double that figure. On Friday, Judge Rhys Rowlands told her she had "made a business of stealing" and her actions had been "planned, calculated and persistent". "I have not seen such a case before. You travelled significant distances to steal from up and down the country and target high value bags," the judge added. The court heard how Rand, a housewife and mother of two, was able to carry out her crimes and even stole to order for some of her online buyers. Prosecutor David Wooler said: "She stole handbags from all over the country. "She targeted department stores including Debenhams, House of Fraser and John Lewis. "Her usual method of theft was to go into the store without a bag, pick up one from the display, walk around with it on her shoulder for a while, then simply walk out of the store. "Sometimes she would have to remove the security tag, but usually she wouldn't have to." But her crime spree came to an end when security staff at a shopping centre in Cwmbran caught her and alerted police. The court heard after officers began to investigate they found she had listed a significant number of handbags for sale on eBay priced competitively. "Her house was full of sealable grey delivery bags and Post Office receipts," the prosecutor told the court. "She set up a legitimate business and no one, not even her husband, knew what she was doing. "Rand told police she needed money to fund her lifestyle." She admitted stealing 905 handbags and four purses from House of Fraser and various retail businesses between December 2009 and December 2012. She also admitted converting criminal assets from 838 handbags. The court was told the cost price of the handbags was in excess of £130,000 but the prosecutor said the retail price would be much greater. In her defence, Andrew Taylor, said: "She bitterly regrets everything that she's done." "She became almost immune to the feeling of wrongdoing. "She was almost addicted to stealing high-value bags in an attempt to keep the ship afloat. "She never expected to find herself in such dire circumstances and out of desperation took this course of action." During sentencing, Judge Rhys Rowlands told Rand: "This was a remarkably serious raft of thefts which only ended when you were caught stealing a valuable handbag from a store in Cwmbran. "How you got away with it for so long without being caught was deeply remarkable. "You showed professionalism and that is why you went undetected for so long. "You travelled the country with the sole purpose of theft and you made a successful albeit dishonest business of selling stolen handbags. "The values are quite outside of what the court comes across even from professional shoplifting gangs. "It's sad and unusual to see a woman of 48 with previous good character up before the court for such a protracted and serious dishonesty. "Many, many businesses get into difficulty but most behave honestly and do not turn to this sort of crime." PC Rhodri Parry, from Gwent Police, said: "Crimes against retailers impact all of the community as it has the effect of making goods more expensive for everyone else. "We are pleased that the individual responsible for a sustained series of thefts from local retailers and those further afield has now been sentenced for her crimes. She will now be subject to a proceeds of crime inquiry." A House of Fraser spokesperson said Rand's behaviour "impacted a number of retailers across the UK". "We commend the vigilance of our Cwmbran store team who identified the woman as acting suspiciously, acted promptly and were supported by the police with her arrest," the spokesperson added. </body>

      <body>A former Denbigh mayor accused of causing a series of explosions in the town told a jury he "made fireworks, not bombs". John Larsen, 46, said he played no part in the explosions in the Lenten Pool area between January and April. Mr Larsen denies causing an explosion, possessing explosives and three arson attacks on cars. He told Caernarfon Crown Court he did not get a "thrill" from his alleged actions. Mr Larsen, a Liberal Democrat town councillor, denied the prosecution's claim that he created gunpowder for explosions. "No, I didn't make any of the explosions," he told prosecutor Wyn Lloyd Jones. Mr Lloyd Jones asked: "Were you getting a thrill from speaking to the newspaper?" Mr Larsen replied: "No. I was asked to speak to the newspaper." He also denied getting a thrill from appearing on television, claiming he only appeared on screen "for a couple of seconds". Mr Larsen denied setting off an improvised explosive device on 24 March near his home with ball-bearings added as shrapnel. But he has accepted experimenting with fuels for firework rockets in his garden. Mr Larsen told the court he bought chemicals for magic tricks and others for fireworks. The former stonemason, who stopped working in 2004 after injuring his back, said his hobbies were photography, fireworks and "hand magic". He told the court he performed magic shows for family and friends. But Mr Lloyd Jones suggested none of the items found at his home were related to magic or displays for children. "That's incorrect," Mr Larsen said. "I have been practising magic for a number of years." Mr Lloyd Jones went on: "You have been practising explosions for three months." "No, I haven't. I get fed up of being called a liar," Mr Larsen replied. "I didn't do the explosions." The trial continues. </body>

      <body>A BBC studio manager died after falling from a cliff at a well known mountain spot in Snowdonia, it has been confirmed. David March, 36, from Thornton Heath in south London, worked for BBC World Service and had been employed at the corporation for 15 years. Mr March fell up to 330ft (100m) from above Devil's Kitchen in the Ogwen Valley on 12 October. He was an experienced walker who was a regular visitor to Snowdonia. Mr March worked for the languages' production team. He spent most of his career at Bush House, in London, before moving to the World Service's new premises at New Broadcasting House in 2012. Speaking at the time of the incident, Chris Lloyd, from the Ogwen Valley team, said it was "an unfortunate tragic accident" and Mr March may have made a navigational error and walked off a cliff. Devil's Kitchen, or Twll Du (Black Hole) in Welsh, is a very well known route above Cwm Idwal in the Ogwen Valley. It marks a tricky crack in rocks which can be scrambled up to reach the Glyder range of peaks and Y Garn. The route can prove challenging for many walkers, especially if there is poor weather and mist, as the path through the rocks and cliffs is ill-defined. </body>

      <body>A police officer has won a national bravery award after he risked his life to save a drowning teenager from a quarry in Carmarthenshire. PC Alun Morgan from the Dyfed-Powys force won the Police Federation prize at a ceremony in London. But despite his efforts in June 2012 at Cilrychen Quarry, Llandybie, 14-year-old Luke Somerfield died. PC Morgan was one of the first on the scene and dived into the water after hearing the screams of upset children. Luke, from Llandeilo, had been in Cilyrychen Quarry with three friends. An inquest into the teenager's death in August last year heard that he became tangled in rope from a lifesaving ring and drowned. A verdict of accidental death was recorded. PC Morgan and his colleagues arrived at the quarry to find it enclosed by an 8ft (2.5m) high chain-link fence, with two lines of barbed wire above and no obvious way to get inside or out. He cut a hole in the fence and asked a worker from a neighbouring engineering firm to cut the chains on the nearby gates so other emergency vehicles could get in. PC Morgan, a former lifeguard, then sprinted to the edge of the quarry lake and, after speaking to witnesses, he tied a rescue line to himself and dived 15ft (4.5m) down to rescue the boy. Luke later died in hospital. PC Morgan, who won the Welsh region police bravery award, said: "It was very tragic and it's bitter sweet to win this award. Sadly the little boy died but we did our best for him as a team. "You don't think about the dangers when you go in, adrenaline kicks in and you just do it. It's only afterwards you start to think about things. "I just wanted to get to the boy as quickly as I could and get him out. I'm very proud and I didn't expect it all." PC Morgan said the Luke Somerfield Memorial Trust had been set up in Luke's memory to educate youngsters about the dangers of water. Steve Williams, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: "Congratulations to PC Morgan for receiving the police bravery award for the Welsh region. "In very traumatic circumstances, knowing the risks involved and despite instructions not to, PC Morgan plunged into treacherous quarry waters. "He risked his own life, determined to save another. PC Morgan's bravery, endurance and dedication to duty cannot be underestimated." </body>

      <body>A planned five-hour strike by firefighters in England and Wales has been called off, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has said. The union said the decision came after progress in talks over pensions - the strike had been due to take place from 18:30 until 23:30 BST on Saturday. The government wants firefighters to work up to 60 but the union says this is too old to be fighting fires. The FBU said it had been presented with a deal similar to that in Scotland. This means firefighters will be able to retire on a full pension between the the ages of 55 and 60 if they are genuinely not fit enough and another role cannot be found for them. A member of staff who does meet the fitness standards and chooses to retire early will get a reduced pension. A final agreement has not yet been reached because negotiations will need to take place between ministers and individual fire authorities about how this will be funded. Firefighters in Scotland voted against a strike. The FBU said 32,000 union members in England and Wales walked out for four hours when it staged a first round of action last month. Contingency plans at the 46 fire services in England and three in Wales included using part-time and volunteer firefighters, calling in non-union fire crews and bringing in private contractors. The armed forces had a back-up role and in the event of a major incident union members could have returned to work. No major incidents were reported during the strike which was the first national walkout for a decade. </body>

      <title>Fresh barracks death inquest call</title>
      <description>Calls are made for a fresh inquest into the 1995 death of an Army recruit from Denbighshire, one of four at the Surrey barracks within seven years.</description>

      <body>Calls have been made by a human rights group for a fresh inquest into the death of an 18-year-old Army recruit from Denbighshire. Liberty is representing the parents of Cheryl James, from Llangollen, who died in November 1995 at Deepcut barracks in Surrey. She was one of four soldiers who died there between 1995 and 2002, sparking allegations of bullying and abuse. The attorney general's office said it was considering the application. Pte Sean Benton, 20, from Hastings, East Sussex, was found dead with gunshot wounds at the barracks in June 1995, just months before Pte James's death, also from gunshot wounds. In September 2001, 17-year-old Pte Geoff Gray, from Seaham, Co Durham, was found with two gunshot wounds to his head, and six months later, Pte James Collinson, from Perth, also 17, was found with a single gunshot wound upwards through his chin. A Surrey Police investigation was launched into the deaths in 2002, following pressure from the families who rejected suggestions the soldiers had committed suicide and called for a public inquiry. Later, a report by the Adult Learning Inspectorate, commissioned by the armed forces minister called for substantial reforms in the training of new recruits. A later investigation by deputy high court judge Nicholas Blake QC called for an independent ombudsman for the armed forces, but rejected the families' calls for a public inquiry. It also concluded that Ptes Gray, James and Benton had committed suicide. An inquest into Pte James' death held shortly after it happened recorded an open verdict. On Friday, Liberty announced it is applying for a fresh inquest into Pte James' death and will soon be doing the same on behalf of the parents of Pte Benton. The group said its application to the attorney general comes after using the Human Rights Act to get access to documentation about Pte James' death that her family have never seen, claiming 44 volumes of statements, documents, notes and photographs contain evidence that has never before been properly examined and suggesting witnesses may have lied. A fresh inquest can be ordered if there is evidence of fraud, irregularity of proceedings, insufficiency of inquiry or new evidence. If the attorney general gives his consent, the matter will be referred to the High Court for consideration, Liberty said. Legal officer Emma Norton said: "Cheryl's grieving family have been consistently snubbed by the state in their quest to discover what really happened to their daughter - only a fresh inquest can deliver the truth they so deserve. "The human rights of our troops are worthy of exactly the same protection as everyone else - until what happened to these young people at Deepcut is competently, calmly and independently investigated, justice will not be done". Pte James' parents Des and Doreen James added: "We're disappointed it has taken close to 18 years for us to even get disclosure of the evidence related to Cheryl's premature death. "No family should ever have to go through what we've experienced, and the fact there still has never been any meaningful inquiry into the four deaths at Deepcut remains a stain on the integrity of everyone involved. "All four were placed in the care of the state and all four were badly let down. "The implications of the new evidence is both serious and extremely worrying for us but we have every confidence in Liberty and our entire legal team." A spokeswoman for the attorney general's office confirmed that it had received an application from Liberty seeking the attorney general's consent to apply for a new inquest into Pte James' death, and it was being considered. </body>

      <title>Rural fuel cut bid leaves out Wales</title>
      <description>An application for a 5p per litre cut in fuel duty in rural areas will not include anywhere in Wales.</description>

      <body>An application for a 5p per litre cut in fuel duty in rural areas will not include anywhere in Wales. Only three towns in England and seven in Scotland passed the criteria for inclusion in the bid to the European Commission (EU). The cut already applies to Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly. Ceredigion's Liberal Democrat MP Mark Williams said he was disappointed but the price guide set by the EU was "very high". "I am very disappointed to see that Ceredigion, nor anywhere in Wales, has been included in the list of places in the UK which the Treasury will put forward to the EU for a fuel rebate," he said. "Having collected data from all of Ceredigion's petrol stations and submitted the evidence to the Treasury, the price guide set by the EU was very high, with some petrol stations in Ceredigion only reaching it on one or two days over the time frame set and others not reaching it at all. "Whilst this is disappointing, the Treasury needs the supporting data in order to make the case to the EU. "I remain convinced the prices we pay are disproportionately high and we must continue to make the case to the Treasury and the EU for the extension of this scheme." Seven of the towns for which the application is being made are in Scotland. They are Acharacle, Achnasheen, Appin, Carrbridge, Dalwhinnie, Gairloch and Strathpeffer. In England, Kirkby-in-Furness in Cumbria, Hawes in North Yorkshire and Lynton in Devon are included. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said that, as a Highlander, he knew "all too well that fuel prices tend to be highest in areas where a car is needed the most". "We've already delivered a tax cut for remote islands and now want to extend that to mainland rural areas that suffer from similarly high prices to the islands," he added. "We have put together the strongest possible evidence base to try and maximise the places that get it." A decision from the EC is expected next year. </body>

      <body>South Wales is becoming the UK centre of advanced armour technology for the military, according to Ministry of Defence (MoD) scientists. The UK government has joined forces with Kennametal Manufacturing in Newport to build a £2m facility. The plant will develop full-size ceramic armour plates to be fitted into uniforms and onto vehicles that will help protect troops on the frontline. It is the largest in Europe, helping to sustain 50 jobs at the Newport site. And it is the first facility in the UK that is able to manufacture these products with the MoD and Kennametal hoping it will help boost growth if they can export them to other countries. Richard Brooks, programme delivery director of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), which is a wing of the Ministry of Defence, said this was part of a 10-year collaboration with Kennametal. "This company's got the right potential, they're willing to invest, they're willing to try risky things, they're willing to innovate - they're a small, agile organisation," he said. "So that's the characteristics we're looking for and that's what this company has given us." It is one of a few companies in south Wales specialising in similar technology. The DSTL is also working with Tata Steel in Port Talbot to develop advanced metallic armour. Manufacturing was once a major employer and source of prosperity in Wales but has faced steep decline. Mike Williams from Kennametal said: "To bring manufacturing industry to Wales is key at the moment. There's so much of it going the other way. "Hopefully, it builds a good foundation for us to grow even further." </body>

      <body>Malky Mackay says he was never asked to step down as Cardiff City manager during a fraught fortnight at the Premier League club. The Scotsman was known to be upset at club owner Vincent Tan's decision to axe head of recruitment Iain Moody. Mackay also stressed that they were "under budget" on transfers despite a summer of heavy recruitment. "Under no circumstances was I asked to resign and at no time have I thought of resigning from the club," Mackay said. Mackay added: "I've read various things in the last couple of weeks and I just need to clarify this, that we absolutely are under budget this summer. "I'm really sorry for the fans and what they've been through over the last couple of weeks. "It's been a difficult time for them where their club has been in the spotlight for non-footballing matters, so I absolutely feel where they're coming from. "Obviously it's as a result of Iain Moody leaving the club and Iain is someone who is absolutely a class act, as far as I'm concerned. "He was very impressive in the job that he's done for the football club and... he's had a huge part to play in the restructuring of my squad. "He brought in over 20-odd players, so he's got a huge part to play in the recent success. "He's someone that everyone here... that works for the football club will sadly be missed by them and he leaves with my utmost gratitude and respect. "I think our loss will be someone's huge gain in football." Former Watford manager Mackay met the club's board on Monday after the removal of Moody, who has been replaced by 23-year-old Alisher Apsalyamov. The Kazakh was on work experience at the club in the summer and is a friend of owner Tan's son. In a statement from the Cardiff board on Tuesday, the club said that transfer dealings will be conducted "subject to the manager's final approval". </body>

      <description>Children as young as 10 have been taught about domestic violence in a pilot scheme which could now be rolled out across Wales.</description>

      <body>Children as young as 10 have been taught about domestic violence in a pilot scheme which could now be rolled out across Wales. Two Carmarthenshire primary schools took part in the six week pilot aimed at recognising danger signs in relationships. Hafan Cymru's project had only been used in secondary schools before. The charity said it was so successful the aim was to use it right across Wales. In the pilot, six sessions for 10 and 11 year olds were delivered in the two participating schools and one for parents and training for staff. Gaynor Jones, schools resource officer for Hafan Cymru, said it was the first scheme in Wales they knew of that has been delivered to children across Years 5 and 6. "They've [the pupils] been absolutely brilliant, they've been really open, they've learnt a lot of new ideas," she added. "They've learnt a lot of new vocabulary and I think it's really important that we get that vocabulary out into the public domain. "We're hearing they're discussing it with parents at home as well and that's great, we want those messages to be carried home." Last year a third of Hafan Cymru's service users were aged 16-24, and the organisation feels that preventative work in schools is key to ending domestic abuse in communities. But Ms Jones admits funding is the issue that could prevent the scheme being rolled out wider. And she is hoping that the Welsh government's White Paper about ending violence against women becomes law and will be followed up with funding which is "absolutely vital". "We know that teenagers are getting into abusive relationships younger and younger now," Ms Jones added. "We're developing a peer education project with our service users in Hafan Cymru and one of those women we're working in entered her first abusive relationship when she was 13. "So by the time children are in secondary school, it's not too late. We can still save some hopefully. "But if we can get the message out younger, that's great." Catrin Nicholas, assistant head teacher at Ysgol Llech y Fedach in Tumble, said she had initial concerns about how such a difficult subject could be dealt with but she said the content had been aimed properly at young children. "Once the initial session was over I realised it was going to be all right because it focused on good relationships with others. "It focused on the positive points of that rather than anything too scary or too frightening for pupils who are so young," she said. </body>

      <title>National teacher strike may go ahead</title>
      <description>Teaching unions say they will press ahead with plans for a one-day national strike before Christmas if the dispute is not resolved.</description>

      <body>Teaching unions say they will press ahead with a one-day national strike before Christmas if a dispute over pay, pensions and jobs is not resolved. Nearly 3,500 schools were closed or partially closed on Thursday in London, Cumbria, and the South East, North East and South West of England. This was the third in a rolling campaign of regional walk-outs. A national strike would include Wales, as teachers' pay and conditions are determined by Westminster. Teachers are angry about the introduction of performance related pay and changes which mean they will have to work until they are at least 65 to be eligible for a full pension, rising to 68 for those born after 1978, say the unions. They also complain of excessive workloads, changes to their working conditions and job cuts. Teachers in the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber region walked out on 1 October. This followed a strike across the North West on 27 June. So far Wales has not been affected by the strikes. Teachers in Northern Ireland and Scotland deal with their devolved governments on pay and conditions and so will remain unaffected by this dispute. The NASUWT says it is considering its next steps but it is likely that the planned one-day national strike will go ahead if the government does not address its concerns. The union's general secretary Chris Keates said: "The rolling programme of strike action has commanded support from the overwhelming majority of teachers. "The Secretary of State can no longer claim that the majority of teachers support his reforms. Teachers' anger and frustration is much in evidence and he now needs to begin to seriously address their concerns. "The NASUWT National Action Committee is keeping matters under review." The government restated its disappointment that the unions were striking over measures to allow head teachers to pay good teachers more. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said only around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed on Thursday, compared with 60% who walked out in the national strikes of November 2011. The government says that it has met the unions frequently to discuss their concerns and will continue to do so. </body>

      <body>Gold coins and bars worth about £30,000 have been stolen from a flat in Pyle, Bridgend. They were taken some time between 16:00 BST Sunday, 13 October, and 14:00 BST the following Tuesday. The fifteen 1oz coins and bars were kept in a maroon velvet draw string bag which police believe may have been discarded by the burglar. Anyone with information can call South Wales Police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. Det Sgt Paul Mason said: "The property stolen is very distinctive. "We believe the person who stole the items will try to sell it on to a collector or will try to weigh the gold in for cash. "We are appealing for people working in pawn shops and cash-for-gold type set-ups to be vigilant." </body>

      <body>Firefighters are warning about the dangers of leaving cooking unattended after two fires in the Conwy area. A 79-year-old man suffered minor burns to his head and arms on Thursday after a chip pan ignited at a property in Llandudno when he had fallen asleep. It followed another call-out to a flat in Colwyn Bay after a fire sparked by an unattended microwave. It comes as North Wales Fire and Rescue Service launches a campaign on cooking safety. "More than half of all accidental dwelling fires we attend in north Wales are cooking related," said Gwyn Jones from north Wales fire service. "The best advice we can give to people is to throw away your old style chip pan - use a thermostatically controlled deep fryer instead which cannot overheat and ignite in the same way. "Never turn your back on cooking, even for a short time, and make sure you have a working smoke alarm." On Friday the fire service launched its "We Don't Want To Come Dine With You" campaign on cooking safety. Over the next few months, fire officers will be offering advice to shoppers in north Gwynedd, as well as handing out kitchen timers and setting a kitchen cooking safety quiz. "Time and time again we attend house fires which have started in the kitchen - it is so easy to forget your cooking, especially if you are tired, distracted or have been drinking," added Mr Jones. "But the consequences can be devastating. We don't want to come dine with you and tackle your kitchen fire." </body>

      <title>Councils' cash falls by average 3.5%</title>
      <description>Councils in Wales will have their Welsh government funding cut by between 4.6 and 1.2% next year, ministers have announced.</description>

      <body>Details of cuts to every local councils' budget from the Welsh government have been announced. Funding for Ceredigion, Denbighshire and Powys will fall by 4.6% but Newport will only experience a 1.2% cut. Prior to the announcement, the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) warned that most councils were unprepared for the scale of cuts. Many of Wales' 22 councils have already started to plan for how they will meet their budget shortfalls. It is expected that cuts to services such as libraries, refuse collections and public toilets will be made across the country. The funding has been distributed according to a formula, taking into account factors such as the number of school pupils, the age profile and size of the local population. Next year's funding is the first to be based on 2011 census figures. Rural areas will experience bigger cuts because of projected reductions in their populations. Newport's settlement is less harsh because its population is rising and it has a large number of school pupils. The government's draft budget last week prioritised the health service, with £570m extra for the NHS. Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems had made a deal with Labour before the announcement to allow the minority government to pass its budget when AMs vote on it in the coming months. Making Wednesday's announcement, Local Government Minister Lesley Griffiths said the total settlement was £4.26bn. She acknowledged the situation was "extremely challenging". The minister said she had included a mechanism ensuring no single council faced an "unmanageable reduction in their allocation" compared to last year, and had transferred over £30m in grants to give councils greater flexibility in managing resources. "I could not have been clearer about the future financial reality facing local government in Wales and I have provided warning of the likely shape of budget reductions," Ms Griffiths said. "For the last three years, the Welsh government has shielded local government from the full force of the cuts to allow them to prepare for the transformational change necessary to maintain vital local services, whilst limiting any additional financial pressure on hard-pressed households." Asked whether local authorities could raise council tax above the 5% limit set informally by the Welsh government, Ms Griffiths said: "I would have to look at that. "I have made it very clear that I have powers to cap and I would have to look very closely at that. But, at the moment, no figures have been mentioned to me. "I will have to see what comes forward and take the decision then." She criticised Rhondda Cynon Taf for using the term "armageddon" in describing the local authority cuts earlier in the week. Ms Griffiths said it was "over the top" and called on councils not to carry out "knee jerk" reactions. She also said that modelling by the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) of a council tax rise of 3.5% was "probably about right" but said she did not have a specific figure in mind. Conservative local government shadow minister Janet Finch-Saunders said: "Labour, the nationalists and Lib Dems agreed a very challenging settlement for Welsh local authorities, which means tough decisions and a forensic scrutiny of council spending. "The challenge for local authorities is to resist the easy options of putting up the council tax bills of hardworking families or cutting frontline services. "Welsh councils need to go through their budgets line by line and eliminate wasteful spending, improve their tax collection rates and deliver services in more imaginative ways. The WLGA said councils were facing "unprecedented funding reductions". It called for "less central regulation and prescription" to allow councils to change the way they run public services. WLGA deputy leader and finance spokesperson Aaron Shotton said: "Whatever councils do, these cuts mean that the public services delivered by local government in Wales will look significantly different within the next three to five years. "Communities throughout Wales will have to revise their expectations significantly in terms of what services they can realistically expect their local councils to deliver, and local councils and their communities will need to engage in some very difficult discussions on what services should be prioritised." BBC Wales' economics correspondent Sarah Dickins writes: It is councillors in Ceredigion, Denbighshire and Powys who will really be feeling pressure with cuts of 4.6% in the money they get from Welsh government. In contrast, in Newport there will be relief that its budget from April is only being cut by 1.2%. Councils have known for months that they will have many millions less to run public services such as social care, school dinners, leisure centres and roads than they have had this year or, for that matter, the year before. Now they have to make decisions about whether to axe specific services, whether to get private companies to run them or whether the work can be done differently, for instance by volunteers or community groups. They will also have to decide how much they can turn to residents for help by increasing council tax. The cuts in funding from Welsh government will have to be found in what is in effect only one third of each council's overall money. Around 40% of their budget is ring-fenced for schools and a further 25% is protected for social services. The remaining 35% does not just pay for services from school meals to gritting to refuse collection but also for councils' long-term borrowing arrangements. A four-week consultation period now begins and councils' final budgets will be set by the end of February. BBC Wales' business correspondent Brian Meechan writes: Councils have a number of options on the table as they face the squeeze. Staff costs make up the bulk of most spending on public services. A Wales Audit Office report said the public sector would need to "identify novel ways of reducing their staffing bills". That could mean flexible working, with reduced hours or moving from full-time to part-time work. It could also mean councils outsourcing some services, for example benefits, computing and technology, and facilities management, to private companies. This can involve the whole scale transfer of staff to the private sector but doesn't necessitate that. Private companies have not proved a popular choice in Wales where local authorities have seemed reluctant to use them as a solution to their financial woes. It's also unpopular with trade unions. But in England, it's a route that many councils have gone down. Mouchel is one company that's profited from this approach. In partnership with Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Services, it maintains highways, road markings, public lighting and street signs for Westminster Council. Meanwhile, Capita runs Service Birmingham, a joint venture with the council that provides IT services. The company says the partnership has led to improved services, reduced costs and created a more efficient, motivated workforce. But there are those who believe that public services shouldn't be about creating profit for private companies and they're sceptical of the claims of improved efficiency. The issues around profit and public services are what's led to a growth in Wales in what's come to be known as the "third sector"- it's neither public nor private. While charities are a part of this, it goes beyond them to describe other organisations that are run as businesses with any profits being reinvested into the business or in other social activities. Many of those third sector organisations are coming together in Cardiff today for the Social Enterprise Wales Conference and councils will almost certainly be looking at how much bigger a role they can play in future provision of services. Some of the bigger examples of these are housing associations. The growth in these over the last decade or so came from some authorities transferring the ownership of their housing stock to not-for-profit housing associations including Valleys to Coast which took over Bridgend's properties. Neath Port Talbot council's leisure facilities meanwhile are run by the not-for-profit Celtic Leisure. It was set up in 2003, long before the financial crash and the cutbacks. It's also happened on a smaller scale when local communities have come together to keep facilities going when they were threatened with closure, Harlech Swimming Pool and the Swansea Tennis Centre being two successful examples. Of course, councils could save by working more closely together as the Welsh government has asked them to do. Their track record though is far from convincing. In 2012, Conwy and Denbighshire councils scrapped plans to merge highways departments. The 22 councils are also supposed to be working together in 4 regional consortia to improve schools which the Education Minister, Huw Lewis, told Good Morning Wales earlier has "not been functioning very well". If councils can't make savings by co-operation, attention may turn to whether there needs to be a reduction in their number as has happened with Local Health Boards. Supporters of reorganisation say it will lead to savings as departments and senior roles are merged. Those against argue that it would be a fraction of cuts that are required and would result in years of problems as councils are distracted from the task of delivering services within tightening budgets while dealing with dramatic changes to their organisations. BBC Wales' arts correspondent Huw Thomas writes: The amount of money that councils spend on the arts and culture is a relatively small proportion of the overall pot, but these services are often funded without any statutory obligation by the local authorities. The situation means there's never any certainty that the funding will continue if the financial climate deteriorates, and the prospect of a significantly tougher 2014/15 local government settlement has already prompted councils to review the services that they fund. Cardiff council has proposed completely cutting the annual grants it gives to some arts organisations in order to save more than £220,000 - which includes stopping a grant worth £161,001 for Sherman Cymru. Flintshire council is reviewing the annual amount it gives to Clwyd Theatr Cymru, which received £1m from the local authority in 2012/13. Other local authorities are also reviewing the non-statutory services they fund, but some councils are also seeking to protect the cultural services that they consider to be a key part of their strategies for attracting tourism and investment. Swansea is currently bidding to be named UK City of Culture 2017, and its joint bid with Carmarthenshire and Neath Port Talbot could mean those authorities are reluctant to significantly reduce their spending on the arts as the judges examine what the area has to offer. </body>

      <body>A Wrexham bakery has sold five of its shops to a Cheshire-based company but it said all 50 staff are being kept on. Shops owned by Village Bakery in Wrexham, Rhos, Llangollen, Ruthin and Holywell will now be run by Chatwins from Nantwich. Village Bakery said it now plans to concentrate on the "booming" wholesale side of its business. Its managing director said it was important the five shops were sold together. "One option would have been to sell the shops separately which would have made sense in strictly commercial terms," said Robin Jones. "However, we deliberately chose to accept the best offer not the highest offer because we felt it was important the five shops were sold together as a going concern to safeguard the future of the staff for whom we have always had a high regard." Retail manager Sharon Cooper said after the initial surprise she, and the rest of the staff, are looking forward to the transfer. "The Village Bakery have really looked after us and they made sure we have gone to a very similar craft bakery that is family run," she said. Managing director Edward Chatwin is a fourth generation member of the family firm established by his great-grandfather John Chatwin in 1913. The acquisition of the Village Bakery outlets means Chatwins now have a total of 26 shops, with the others being in Cheshire and Staffordshire. He said: "We have known the Jones family at the Village Bakery for a long time and both bakeries have a similar ethos and a real passion for our products, so it was a very good fit." Village Bakery managing director Robin Jones had written individually to the members of staff. "Like the Village Bakery, Chatwins are a family run firm of craft bakers and all the existing staff will be kept on with pay and conditions being protected. There will be no job losses," he said. He added that Village Bakery has been growing rapidly in recent years due to the expansion of the wholesale market. </body>

      <body>One of the "worst examples of poor treatment" led to the death of a man who was not told he had been diagnosed with a life-threatening condition, said a watchdog. Public Services Ombudsman Peter Tyndall upheld a complaint by the family of Carl Nolan, 30, of Rhyl, who had congenital cirrhosis of the liver. Mr Nolan had been treated at Glan Clwyd hospital. Health bosses said required standards were not met but changes had been made. The ombudsman's report, which refers to Mr Nolan as Mr X, said he was born with cirrhosis of the liver and diagnosed with the "life-threatening" condition - which replaces healthy tissue with non-functioning scar tissue - in 2000 but neither he nor his family were told at the time. And although a follow-up outpatient appointment was made for him in 2001 the IT worker was not notified, said the report. He became ill again in 2008 and was given treatment but investigations to determine the cause were not concluded. It was not until he requested a second opinion that he was told he had been born with cirrhosis. The report was not able to establish why Mr Nolan had not been initially told of his condition or given advice about how he could make lifestyle changes to improve his health after diagnosis of the condition. In 2010, he was admitted to hospital several times in quick succession after becoming ill again and blood tests showed that "his liver was failing". But the hospital "sent him away, only finally admitting him three days after his appearance" with a serious infection and before finally being referred for specialist treatment. He died seven weeks later. The report said: "Had he been treated three days earlier, Mr X should have recovered from the infection and had a chance of receiving a liver transplant. This opportunity to survive and flourish was denied him." In an interview with BBC Wales, Mr Tyndall said: "If he had been appropriately and promptly treated, his family are left with the knowledge that he could still be with us today. "He was a young man with his life ahead of him, a partner, a loving family, and all that was taken away. "I was shocked by what our investigation found in this instance. "This is one of the worst examples of poor treatment and poor communication with a patient that I have encountered in my time as ombudsman." He upheld the family's complaint and issued recommendations to hospital manager Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board to review its "care pathway" and appointments system as well as its complaints handling process. Mr Nolan's mother Pat, a call centre supervisor, said had he been advised about his diagnosis in 2001 he could have sought and received specialist help and advice to improve his condition and could, ultimately, be alive today had he been able to receive a liver transplant. Mrs Nolan said: "This is a catalogue of errors and everybody along the line is accountable for Carl's death because they knew what he had and no one saw fit to communicate that and act upon it. "I don't know what their procedures are but something is very lax." Angela Hopkins, health board executive director of nursing, midwifery and patient services, said: "The health board recognises that some of the care given was below the standard that should have been provided to the patient and family. "We fully accept the recommendations in the report and have taken action to address each one made. "We are reviewing our appointment system and process and gastroenterology care pathways to provide an improved and more robust safe service for patients. "We are also making sure that safeguard measures are implemented to improve our standards of engagement with patients while they are treated by the health service in north Wales." The ombudsman also recommended that £5,000 be paid to the family to acknowledge the "failings and provide financial redress" along with £500 for its "poor complaint handling". The report said the family wanted changes to ensure the same "mistakes are never repeated". The ombudsman can hold the institution to account but not individuals involved in the care of Mr Nolan. Hs mother has written to the General Medical Council which regulates doctors and the medical profession asking that her son's case is reviewed. "As far as I can see they seem to be above the law and not answerable to anybody and it has got to stop," she said. </body>

      <body>A town council is looking for a new home after it was left with a £20,000 bill to bring its current Victorian building up to fire safety standards. Newtown Town Council has been told the fire alarm system in its 19th Century headquarters needs upgrading. It also needs new fire doors and might need re-wiring after a fire report described the building as "unsafe and unacceptable". It has approached Powys council about using one of its buildings. The current town council building also houses a museum honouring the social reformer Robert Owen, who was born in the town. Last month, Deputy Mayor Richard Edwards said it had failed to comply with a series of new fire regulations which had been introduced in the last few years. Speaking at a full council meeting this month, town council clerk Jenn Jones said that the report required a substantial list of improvements which had to be carried out immediately. The costs of carrying out the work was estimated to be well in excess of £20,000 and not all the estimates for the work were yet known. It was unanimously agreed that the council would actively explore vacating the building. A Powys council spokesman said: "The town council have approached us to see if we can find them some accommodation within our buildings if and when they have to leave their current building. "We have held initial discussions but nothing has yet been decided." </body>

      <title>How will Welsh councils save cash?</title>
      <description>Wales' 22 local authorities have been told what their individual budgets for next year will be, but what is your council planning to do to make savings?</description>

      <body>The total amount of cash available to councils around Wales to pay for services such as bin collections, libraries, leisure centres and public toilets has been announced by the Welsh government. It was announced last week that funding for local government would see a cut of 5.81% next year. Local government spending will fall from £4.648bn this year to £4.466bn next year, a cut in cash terms of 3.91% or 5.81% in real terms. Their budgets will be around 9% lower in real terms between now and 2015-16. So how are Wales' 22 local authorities going to deal with budget shortfalls: Council leader Ieuan Williams said: "We now anticipate that the council will face cuts in the region of £7-8m and cuts of this magnitude will hit the authority hard. "It's more than likely that we'll again be forced to raise Council Tax by the maximum 5% with a smaller percentage increase unsustainable." Finance portfolio holder Hywel Eifion Jones added: "The reduction in funding for Anglesey of -4% against a Welsh average of -3.5% seems most unfair given our high levels of elderly and unemployed residents. "The provisional settlement is disappointing news from the Welsh government and bound to have a significant effect on the level of Council Tax and future services. "We'll shortly start consulting with fellow councillors and the public regarding their priorities, but clearly some services will need to be provided in a different way in the future." Anglesey chief executive Richard Parry Jones said: "We'll now have to assess the significant impact that the settlement will have on our capacity to provide services. "The council's heads of service are currently working on initial recommendations for efficiency savings, and these will have to be prioritised by our elected members in due course. "We also, of course, intend to consult widely with stakeholders and partners as part of the process of formulating the council budget for 2014/15. "The decisions will be difficult and it is inevitable that we will have to curtail services to the people of Anglesey." BBC Wales news website is awaiting a response from Blaenau Gwent council. Mel Nott, Leader of Bridgend County Borough Council, said: "It is now inevitable that we face having to make some very difficult decisions. "This will obviously have a huge effect on council services, but we are preparing for the challenge by making changes that will move the authority away from some of the more traditional activities and structures associated with local government. "The council has a medium-term financial strategy in place which is ensuring that we prioritise and focus our available resources efficiently and in a co-ordinated manner. "We need to fundamentally alter the way in which the council works, spends money and makes use of resources, so in future there will be a greater focus on innovation, shared services, lower costs and collaboration. "However, there should be no illusions about the reality of the situation that we face, nor the pressing need to start looking at making savings in areas that we have previously tried to protect." A spokesman for Caerphilly council said: "We are going to have to make some very difficult decisions in the wake of this extremely tough budget announcement. "Even though the situation is very challenging, Caerphilly is in a good position compared to some other Welsh local authorities and this is largely down to the sound financial strategy adopted by the council over the last few years." Councillors will consider the budget settlement on 23 October. The council needs to try and bridge a budget shortfall of £125m over the next three years. Among its plans, it will reassess the way grants are awarded to ensure there is greater fairness in funding decisions and better service delivery based on requirements and community priorities. The council currently provides £2.7m in grant funding to a wide range of third sector organisations but says many grants are historic with no clear indication of strategic need. It is considering new ways of delivering services which include merging departments and collaborating with other councils. However it has warned that it is considering "drastic measures" such as service reduction and even ending some services completely. Its budget proposals are being prepared over the next few months before going out to public consultation. Next week, all members of the council will be invited to discuss around 60 proposals for efficiency savings to bridge the funding gap Carmarthenshire faces, before a large-scale public consultation is launched. Council leader Kevin Madge has already warned people to brace themselves for change, and has acknowledged that members will be faced with making tough and unpopular decisions over the coming months. Now, he is calling on all 74 members of the council as well as community and voluntary groups to work together to ensure as many services and jobs can be protected. "This is one of the toughest settlements we've ever had," he said. "We've already tightened our belts and made significant efficiency savings in the last few years, which is why it's going to be hard to cut back further. "However, by working together with our communities, we will stand a better chance of protecting front-line services and jobs. "I also call on every member of council to work together, similar to how they've worked together in Welsh government where they've put their political differences aside to move forward and set a budget." Earlier, a spokesman for Carmarthenshire council said: "We are holding an elected members seminar shortly which will set out the council's financial position, and give members the opportunity to discuss and consider up to 40 separate options and proposals for savings. "Over the coming months, consultation will also involve the general public, local businesses and stakeholder groups. "Until this exercise has been undertaken, we can't say exactly what services will be affected." A spokesperson for Ceredigion Council said the authority will be facing a reduction in funding from the Welsh Government of 4.6%, which is a cash reduction of almost £5m. That reduction is before taking into account the need to increase the existing budget for inflationary increases, additional funding for implementing national pay awards, and budgetary pressures on existing services, which means that the council will need to identify budget savings in the region of £9.5m for 2014/15. Councillor Ellen ap Gwynn, leader of the council, said: "This is the worst ever financial settlement for Welsh Local Authorities and in particular for Ceredigion by some margin. "It is an unprecedented situation for all Welsh local authorities, but is especially challenging for rural councils such as Ceredigion. "We will have to make some very difficult decisions over the next few months as we try and minimise the impact on the existing services, and we must accept that some services will need to be reduced or even cut." In a report, the local authority said: "Conwy's financial framework for the period 2012 to 2017 highlighted an extremely challenging financial landscape which predicted an annual resource shortfall of around £5m per year for the financial years covered, even after council tax increases of around 5% per year. "Indeed 2014/2015 projected a shortfall of £4.5m with warnings that 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 were likely to be at similar levels ie 'more of the same'." A spokesperson for Denbighshire Council said: "Denbighshire council has been expecting a difficult budget settlement and we have been preparing for it. "The reduction of 4.6% is on the more severe end of what we have been planning for and it will require the council to take some difficult decisions. "Options for reductions are now being developed for elected members to consider during their deliberations over the next few months. "Final decisions on the 2014/15 budget will be taken in the new year. "The council is committed to delivering excellent services and maximising efficiencies from everything it does will be its key response to this settlement. "On the positive side the council welcomes the apparent relaxation of 'ring fencing' rules for a number of grants and budget areas. "We haven't had the time to analyse the figures carefully yet, but it seems that the council will be able to look for efficiencies and savings from a wider area than was possible in 2013/14 and this is to be welcomed." The council's initial reaction to the local settlement is: Council leader Aaron Shotton said: "The provisional settlement is as predicted. The task ahead is to plan significant and rapid change within the council to make major savings to balance the books for 2014-15 and protect local services to the best of our ability. "It is important that we are not hit by any reductions in the specific grants from Welsh government which support day to day services from education to recycling. "These grants are normally confirmed long after the settlement and we do not want unexpected 'devil in the detail'. "We cannot absorb a double financial 'hit' in a matter of months. "Flintshire is a stable and well performing council - we now have a major job on our hands to hold that position." The council is looking to reorganise and reduce the cost and complexity of management as well as a phased reduction in workforce numbers. A spokesman said before the budget announcement: "The way the council will have to change and become even more modern will remain underpinned by protecting and developing the most important public services in communities, being as modern and high performing as we can in customer services and being as efficient and cost effective as possible." A spokesman for Gwynedd Council said: "At present, we estimate that we could be facing a £16m funding shortfall in 2014/15. "Thanks to long-term financial planning, we have already identified over £6m of savings to help bridge this gap, and we estimate that other potential measures identified will lead to an additional saving of around £6m. "This means that we will need to deliver a further £4m during the year. "We are looking at a number of possible options to mitigate the demand for our services, and carefully weighing up the possible savings that could be achieved against the potential negative impact upon the county's residents." Councillor Brendan Toomey, the leader of Merthyr Tydfil council, said: "Like the other 22 council's across Wales, Merthyr Tydfil CBC had already started to plan for how we would meet our budget deficit for 2014/15. "While originally working on a - 4% budget cut, in real terms £6.1m deficit, we are now looking at an actual deficit of £3.5m. "Whilst the 2.2% is better than expected, this council will still have to make some very serious and unprecedented cuts which will mean that the services that we deliver to the people of Merthyr Tydfil will look different within the next three to five years. "As always, we will continue to work extremely hard in order to protect the most vulnerable in the community whilst also protecting as many staff within the organisation as possible." Peter Fox, leader of Monmouthshire County Council, said: "We are disappointed but not surprised that we have seen a provisional cut of 4.4% in our annual settlement from the Welsh government. "Although it is slightly worse than we'd been led to believe, we have for some time been planning for a cut of around this level. "We have managed a significant year-on-year decline in our funding for some time now, against a backdrop of our being Wales' lowest funded council per head of population. "We have already taken significant steps toward addressing this shortfall in our funding. "We are currently meeting directly with our communities, and cabinet has already mandated officers to explore proposed savings of £6.5m, although we are mindful that this would not be sufficient to meet next year's cut. "We will continue to work hard to address next year's shortfall and the projected shortfall of £23m over the next four years." The council has already outlined plans to make £6.5m in savings and will hold a number of public engagement meetings in the county over the next two weeks. Among the areas where savings could be made is school transport. The authority is considering reviewing its school transport arrangements based on nearest school policy. It is also considering reducing grants to the third sector and transforming adult social care and children's services. Reductions to cleaning rounds and gritting schedules could also be introduced as well as street lights being switched off. Five public consultation sessions are to be held about the matter and the council has scheduled that the proposals will be concluded by the end of November 2013 with a special cabinet meeting on 18 December. A spokesperson for the council said: "We will be looking at the details of the draft settlement and preparing a report for cabinet on our options for savings for members to decide upon." A spokesman said it had developed a forward financial plan which identified the need for £23m savings over the next four years (this is on top of £30m savings over the past four years). A report will be prepared for members regarding the specific impact of the settlement and what the options will be. A spokesman for the council said it also has a report out to consult on proposals for its library provision for savings of up to £238,000. A spokesperson for Newport City Council said that as expected it would "once again receive a cut to its revenue budget from Welsh government". "The council fully anticipated a reduction and has been making plans to change the way it delivers services with less money and an increased demand," said the spokesperson. "The council recognises it still has to make significant savings and is faced with the task of redesigning public services as set out in the recently published 'Prospectus for Change'. "The next few years will be extremely difficult and the impact on services will be profound. "Residents can already submit their comments and ideas for improvement by emailing changing.services@newport.gov.uk. "A full public consultation on budget proposals will be launched later this year." Reacting to the settlement cut leader Jamie Adams, said that his authority faced severe challenges in common with other councils in Wales. "As I have previously said, we have to accept that local authorities are not immune from the cuts and we have a part to play in the belt-tightening process during these straitened times," he said. "However, when we do make the difficult decisions that we will undoubtedly face, we will do our utmost to ensure that front-line services and the vulnerable are protected as much as possible. "I believe that as we are an authority which is on a firm, financial footing we are able to meet and resolve these challenges. "The council's cabinet will be receiving a comprehensive report on the implications of the Budget at its 4th November meeting." The council has said it will be moving to fortnightly black bin bag collections to save £500,000 a year. It is also planning to reduce the number of public toilets it is responsible for - there are currently 93 public toilets in Pembrokeshire costing the council £1.5m a year to run. Seven are earmarked for closure. Mr Adams has said it was inevitable that Welsh government cuts in funding to local government would have repercussions on the authority's future spending. "We have to accept that, as a local authority, we too have to play a part in the belt-tightening process during these straitened times. "However, when we do make the difficult decisions that we will undoubtedly face, we will do our utmost to ensure that front-line services and the vulnerable are protected as much as possible," he said. Powys says it will face a cut in funding of nearly £9m in the next financial year along with increased "service pressures" of £11m leaving the county facing a funding shortfall of £20m for 2014/15. Leader David Jones said: "Powys has once again fared badly with its annual budget allocation with a 4.6% cut in funding - jointly the largest in Wales and well above the Welsh average cut of 3.5%. "Powys has experienced below Welsh average funding for five out of the last six years and that poor funding trend has continued greatly increasing the pressure on providing local services. There are also early indications that there could be a further cut of around 2% in 2015/16. "We are grateful that there has been some protecting provided by Welsh government otherwise the news could have been even worse. "This year we received £190.6m external funding from Welsh government but that figure will be reduced to £182.2m next year. Added to that the council is facing increasing demand for services and unavoidable costs that could add a further £11m added to our operating costs. "Providing viable public services with such reduced budgets will be a huge challenge, particularly since the majority of our funding is used for 'protected services' - education and adult social care. "The remaining service areas such as highways, waste, leisure and the arts, although hugely appreciated, will have to bear the brunt of very difficult budget decisions. "We have already been forced to take unpopular decisions in response to the chill wind of austerity measures but I am afraid the coming years will see far more difficult debates and I hope that Powys residents understand our difficulties." Council leader Anthony Christopher said: "Considering how significantly public sector funding to Wales has been cut by the UK government a settlement of this nature was inevitable. "This council has already taken the very difficult step of bringing forward options on how we bridge the significant gap in funding we now face and is due to consider initial proposals next week. "Based on the provisional information released today, as predicted the level of savings we will be faced with making over the next four years will now be above our original indication of £56m. "Because the Welsh government has done its utmost to protect Wales' public services from the worst of the UK government's cuts, this is the first financial year that 'all' our communities will really feel the pain and the realities of the UK governments public sector funding cuts. "Despite the severity of the decisions already being considered it is clear that further and even tougher decisions around the range and level of services we offer will need to be taken in the coming months. "In my 25 years in local government I have never had to consider such a bleak outlook for public services. "My colleagues and I know fully how the decisions we will need to take will impact upon the communities we represent, but faced with such significant reductions in funding we simply have no alternatives. "In the coming weeks therefore the cabinet will be forced to consider further reductions and significant changes to the services we currently provide. "Very clearly the austerity measures of the UK government are biting and the effects of Wales' funding being reduced by £1.6bn are set to become very apparent in our local communities." Cabinet members at Rhondda Cynon Taf Council are due to meet next week to consider the first phase of a programme of cuts. Under the proposals children in RCT will start full-time school a year later than they currently do in a bid to save £4.5m a year. Closing 14 of 26 libraries in RCT could save £800,000 per year, while closing 10 out of 19 day centres could save £600,000 per year. Proposed changes to youth services could save £2.2m while £300,000 could be saved by ending the delivery of meals on wheels at the weekend. Swansea council said the headline settlement figure of a 3.1% reduction in funding was broadly in line with expectations. The council said it would be studying the Welsh government's figures in detail but expected overall that it would have to make savings of £45m by 2017. Apart from a reduced settlement, the council said it was also facing a range of funding pressures including rising customer expectation and increasing demand for adult and children's services. Rob Stewart, cabinet member for finance, said: "We've already been consulting with local residents and most people I've talked to understand we are in tough times and the budget issue is a difficult position not of the council's making. "This isn't simply about trying to save money. We have an opportunity to transform the council by finding better ways of doing things to improve the services we provide." He added: "No decisions have been made yet because we are consulting with residents, stakeholders and staff to consider their views." Swansea has been holding a consultation with residents called Sustainable Swansea. Detailed budget proposals will be set out in December. The council predicts it requires savings of at least a further £40m over the next four years. Cuts to school transport service, black bag collections and garden waste collections are being considered. It has said making those savings is "no longer a case of trimming the edges" and has warned of difficult and uncomfortable decisions to be made. The executive member for resources, Councillor Anthony Hunt, said: "We must look at the local services we provide, consider our priorities and look at how they impact on our desire to protect the most vulnerable people in our communities. "Instead of burying our heads in the sand or making decisions behind closed doors, we want to be honest and open with people about the difficult situation and work together to find solutions. "We want to hear from residents about which services they value most, what they could do without and what they'd be prepared to pay more for." The council plans a number of joint working opportunities with neighbouring authorities and health boards including establishing jointly funded posts as part of its drive to plug the £25.7m funding shortfall. It says any targets set will be extremely challenging for services. It is due to meet to discuss proposals. Councillor Malcolm King OBE, Lead Member for Policy, Finance, Performance and Governance said: "There is no disguising the fact that this is very bad news for Wrexham. "In previous years, the council has made millions of pounds of savings year on year and has strived to protect schools and social care. "But the scale of the reductions contained in this announcement is unprecedented. It is very different to what the council have been planning for just a few months ago. "Unfortunately the funding situation looks bleak for quite a few years to come. "Although the challenge to find around £13m of cuts next year is very daunting, the longer term challenges are even more difficult." With a shortfall of at least £34m over the next five years, Wrexham has pledged to take a "fundamental look" at all of its work so resources can be used as "effectively as possible". The council has said: "This includes reprioritising and reducing services, ceasing services, considering alternative delivery models, working more effectively and efficiently with existing and new partners and eliminating waste. "Reshaping is also to be focused on improving services as well as enabling delivery at a lower cost." It plans to take a "package approach" to reshaping services saying that there was not a single project or single solution that will deliver the value of reductions required. It said: "The overall approach is not about tinkering with what we currently do. There will be a requirement to take a fundamental look at areas like reprioritising and reducing services, ceasing some services altogether, considering alternative delivery models, working more effectively and efficiently with existing and new partners and eliminating waste. Reshaping is also to be focused on improving services as well as enabling delivery at a lower cost." Areas the council are looking at in its ethos of the need to work differently include: </body>

      <body>A £107m project linking Port Talbot and the docks to the M4 has been officially opened. It is hoped the three-mile (4.8km) Harbour Way running from junction 38 at Margam will boost the docks area with land being opened up for development. It would also help to cut congestion through the town. The road is one of the largest local council transport projects the Welsh government and European Regional Development Fund has backed. "The completion of Harbour Way is a significant development both for the town of Port Talbot and for the county borough as a whole," Neath Port Talbot council leader Ali Thomas said. "By linking key employment sites and opening up land for development along the waterfront, the project will present numerous opportunities for growth and regeneration. "The economic benefits will be far-reaching and indeed this investment is already beginning to pay dividends." The docks area is being transformed into a new knowledge-focused business hub, creating hundreds of skilled jobs. Plans are also in place for further development of the wider Harbourside Park area as the 150-acre site has the capacity to accommodate an additional 75,000 sq ft of space It could lead to a potential investment of over £12m and creation of a further 700 new jobs. Proposals are also in the pipeline for a future residential and leisure development which will sit next to the dockside and river corridor. First Minister Carwyn Jones, who opened the road, said: "With Harbour Way now complete, and a further £9.5m of Welsh Government funding for the re-development of Port Talbot Parkway train station, robust infrastructure links will soon be in place to attract further investment to the region to transform the area into a vibrant, well connected place to live, work and do business for many years to come." </body>

      <title>School pupils offered TB screening</title>
      <description>Screening for tuberculosis (TB) will be offered to 124 pupils at a comprehensive school in Carmarthenshire after a staff member was diagnosed with the infection.</description>

      <body>Screening for tuberculosis (TB) will be offered to 124 pupils at a comprehensive school in Carmarthenshire after a staff member was diagnosed with the infection. Letters have been sent to parents at Ysgol y Strade, Llanelli, saying their children will be offered a blood test next Thursday. Health officials say the risk that the infection has spread to pupils is low. Precautionary screening is also being offered to 21 members of staff. They are those identified as being close contacts of the patient. Sion Lingard, acting consultant in health protection for Public Health Wales (PHW), said TB is difficult to catch and is treatable with antibiotics. "We are emphasising to pupils, parents and staff that it is very rare for TB to be transmitted within a school environment and so we are offering screening as a precaution," he said. "Close contact with an infectious individual over a long time period, such as living in the same household, is usually required for a person to become infected with TB." Another four cases of TB had been identified in the Llanelli area over the last year, he said, but none of these have links to the school. "Investigations into these cases are continuing with the involvement of Hywel Dda Health Board with treatment, advice and screening offered where appropriate," Mr Lingard added. TB is an infection usually found in the lungs, but any part of the body can be affected. People can catch TB by breathing in the bacteria in tiny droplets sneezed or coughed out by someone who has the infection in their lungs. The most common symptom of TB is a persistent cough for more than three weeks, with spit which can sometimes be blood-stained. Other symptoms can include weight loss, a high temperature, and sweating, particularly at night. Public Health Wales said anyone who is concerned about their health should speak to their GP or contact NHS Direct Wales on 0845 46 47. </body>

      <body>A number of Premier League clubs are introducing reciprocal deals to reduce the price of tickets for away fans. Newcastle United have agreed deals with West Bromwich Albion and Swansea City, while the Welsh club have a further agreement in place with Hull City. Magpies finance director John Irving said: "We believe the right way to encourage people to attend is to look at charging reasonable prices." Premier League clubs were each given £200,000 to subsidise travelling fans. Swansea fans will pay a reduced price of £20 for adults and £5 for concessions at Hull and Newcastle, with the same prices in place for the return fixtures at the Liberty Stadium. Travelling supporters from Newcastle and West Brom will both pay £15 for adults and £5 for concessions when their teams face each other. Swansea vice-chairman Leigh Dineen hopes more agreements can be made. "I'm glad to see that things have slowly started to gather pace," he said. "We are in constant dialogue with other clubs in the Premier League and hope to announce additional reciprocal deals over the course of the campaign. "We are determined to help keep the costs down for travelling supporters; not just for our own loyal fans, but those supporters of other clubs around the country as well." Away attendances have declined by 10% over the past five seasons and the Football Supporters' Federation  has said the cost of tickets is a major concern. A 2013 BBC study of the costs of football found the average prices of the most expensive season ticket and highest and lowest match-day prices in the Premier League had fallen by up to 5.3%. </body>

      <body>The lives and homes of thousands of people could have been put at risk because of poor management at a public body, a committee of AMs has warned. The Caldicot and Wentlooge Internal Drainage Board is responsible for ensuring the Gwent Levels do not flood. The latest criticism follows a Wales Audit Office (WAO) report which said the board misused public funds. AMs said the findings did not reflect on the board's managers now. Its powers are likely to be transferred elsewhere. The Welsh government said it understands appropriate control measures are now in place at the board. The body, which is independent of government, manages drainage systems in an area of low-lying coastal land between Cardiff and Chepstow, south of the M4 and bordered by the Severn estuary. The WAO investigation into the board's 2010/11 accounts found irregularities in the way some senior staff had awarded themselves and others pay rises. It also had evidence that the board went on trips around Europe with "little or no" business case to justify their need. It said that in 2005, 37 people went on a £4,333 three-day inspection visit to Venice, including 13 staff and board members and 21 guests, mainly spouses or relatives. Another excursion to Northern Ireland for 28 people in 2008, which included a visit to a distillery and the Giants Causeway, cost more than £4,700. The Welsh assembly's public accounts committee said events at Caldicot and Wentlooge were "a prime example of how not to run a publicly-funded organisation". In a new report, committee chair Darren Millar AM said: "There were no clear lines of accountability for the board and it was not effectively monitored in developing and implementing a strategic plan for flood-risk management in the Gwent Levels. "We believe that this potentially put the lives and property of thousands of people at risk." The committee report concluded that "poor governance and accountability" led to staffing disputes and infighting at the drainage board. Mr Millar said: "Caldicot and Wentlooge IDB is responsible for managing the appropriate drainage for a strategically critical area of Wales, which encompasses major infrastructure, businesses, farmland and tens of thousands of homes. "The committee believes that the poor governance, accountability and transparency at the board had the potential to put all of that at risk." He also warned that the committee was concerned that the issues at the board may not be unique and urged Welsh ministers to remind other public bodies of their responsibilities. But Mr Millar said the board had taken action to address many of the issues highlighted by the WAO and the report's findings did not reflect on the current management team. There are three internal drainage boards currently operating wholly or mainly in Wales: Caldicot and Wentlooge Levels, which is wholly in Wales; Lower Wye, which is mainly in Wales and partly in England; and Powysland, which is also mainly in Wales and partly in England. Natural Resources Minister Alun Davies said he was now considering merging all three boards with environmental body Natural Resources Wales. In a statement to AMs, he said the issues raised about Caldicot and Wentlooge board do not "reflect the culture or standards of public service that we have a right to expect from any public body". "It is clear from the report that it lacked some of the necessary governance controls, checks and balances that a public body must possess," Mr Davies said "We have already consulted on the future of these bodies and in the consultation we made clear that our preferred option was to transfer the powers of the internal drainage boards to Natural Resources Wales. "I have considered responses to the consultation and have asked officials to look at the costs, benefits and risks of a transfer to Natural Resources Wales, alongside other options. "This work is well advanced, and I expect to announce my decision on the future of these boards in the next month." </body>

      <body>A driver who killed two motorists during an "outrageous" high-speed road race and then fled to the pub has been jailed for five years. Luke Jones, 24, was doing up to 100mph on the A465 Heads of the Valleys road near Brynmawr moments before the crash. Cardiff Crown Court heard Jones, of Clydach, near Abergavenny, braked sharply while racing Phillip Bath, 29. Mr Bath lost control of his car which hit oncoming traffic and he and a motorcyclist died in the "carnage" . Father-of-one Jones fled the scene and went drinking with a friend and was later arrested at a nearby pub. Prosecutor Nicholas Gareth Jones said Jones and Mr Bath came across each other when joining the road. He added: "Their vehicles are described as racing, overtaking one another, speeding and causing other cars to dodge and swerve out of the way. "One witness described Mr Bath's car as skidding around like Formula 1 car warming up its tyres. "Another said it was an accident waiting to happen and that they were driving like lunatics. "They were driving at excessive speed - up to 90 or 100 miles an hour - for a three-mile stretch before the accident. "The collision happened when Jones misjudged the speed of a car in front and was forced to brake. "Mr Bath couldn't stop, he slammed the brakes and spun into oncoming traffic colliding with a motorcycle." Mr Bath, of Cwm, near Ebbw Vale, was taken to University of Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, by air ambulance but never recovered from his injuries. His yellow Peugeot had failed an MOT shortly before the crash and was described as being "not road worthy". Motorcyclist Glyndwr Evans, 49, of Glynneath, who used to work for the RAF, died instantly in the crash on 27 October, 2012. Another motorcyclist was treated at hospital for two and a half months following the crash and will never be well enough to ride a bike again. Jones originally told police the collision had "nothing to do with him" but later admitted two counts of causing death by dangerous driving. He said he was racing but claimed he was only doing 70 mph. Caroline Rees, defending, said: "He had difficulty doing the right thing and pleading guilty. Jones had previously been disqualified twice from driving for not having insurance. Judge Daniel Williams told him: "This was an outrageous piece of driving over quite a distance. "You were racing each other and your driving was described as frightening. "You were using the road like a race track at a time when there were a lot of cars on the road and you represented a serious danger. "At the time you were the lead car and because of your speed you failed to brake in time and Mr Bath went out of control. "I accept you are sorry but that would be of far greater weight if you had not left the scene of carnage which you caused." </body>

      <body>Police have arrested 46 suspected drug dealers as part of a joint operation to reduce crime in Cardiff. The arrests come after a six-month undercover operation targeting dealers supplying Class A drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine in five areas. Detectives were alerted to concerns about dealing in Roath, Cathays, the city centre, Riverside and Grangetown. In three weeks, 40 men, four women and two juveniles aged between 16-55 were arrested as part of Operation Foxtrot. The arrests were across Cardiff in connection with more than 200 drug offences. A fifth woman has also been arrested for possession of CS spray. Operation Foxtrot has involved a partnership between South Wales Police, Cardiff Council and Cardiff and Vale University Health Board. Detective Chief Inspector Tony Brown said: "Operation Foxtrot is a partnership approach to tackling drugs in our communities. "This means taking drugs off our street, putting the dealers in prison, cleaning areas where drug deals have taken place, and providing support to drug users. "During this operation we have witnessed drugs being sold openly on our streets, in parks and in subways, which quite simply will not be tolerated. "This operation is nothing more than the good people of Cardiff deserve." Anyone with information on the supply of drugs is asked to contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, South Wales Police on 101, or their local officer whose contact details can be found on www.ourbobby.com </body>

      <body>The lives and homes of thousands of people could have been put at risk because of poor management at a public body, a committee of AMs has warned. The Caldicot and Wentlooge Internal Drainage Board is responsible for ensuring the Gwent Levels do not flood. The latest criticism follows a Wales Audit Office (WAO) report which said the board misused public funds. AMs said the findings did not reflect on the board's managers now. Its powers are likely to be transferred elsewhere. The Welsh government said it understands appropriate control measures are now in place at the board. The body, which is independent of government, manages drainage systems in an area of low-lying coastal land between Cardiff and Chepstow, south of the M4 and bordered by the Severn estuary. The WAO investigation into the board's 2010/11 accounts found irregularities in the way some senior staff had awarded themselves and others pay rises. It also had evidence that the board went on trips around Europe with "little or no" business case to justify their need. It said that in 2005, 37 people went on a £4,333 three-day inspection visit to Venice, including 13 staff and board members and 21 guests, mainly spouses or relatives. Another excursion to Northern Ireland for 28 people in 2008, which included a visit to a distillery and the Giants Causeway, cost more than £4,700. The Welsh assembly's public accounts committee said events at Caldicot and Wentlooge were "a prime example of how not to run a publicly-funded organisation". In a new report, committee chair Darren Millar AM said: "There were no clear lines of accountability for the board and it was not effectively monitored in developing and implementing a strategic plan for flood-risk management in the Gwent Levels. "We believe that this potentially put the lives and property of thousands of people at risk." The committee report concluded that "poor governance and accountability" led to staffing disputes and infighting at the drainage board. Mr Millar said: "Caldicot and Wentlooge IDB is responsible for managing the appropriate drainage for a strategically critical area of Wales, which encompasses major infrastructure, businesses, farmland and tens of thousands of homes. "The committee believes that the poor governance, accountability and transparency at the board had the potential to put all of that at risk." He also warned that the committee was concerned that the issues at the board may not be unique and urged Welsh ministers to remind other public bodies of their responsibilities. But Mr Millar said the board had taken action to address many of the issues highlighted by the WAO and the report's findings did not reflect on the current management team. There are three internal drainage boards currently operating wholly or mainly in Wales: Caldicot and Wentlooge Levels, which is wholly in Wales; Lower Wye, which is mainly in Wales and partly in England; and Powysland, which is also mainly in Wales and partly in England. Natural Resources Minister Alun Davies said he was now considering merging all three boards with environmental body Natural Resources Wales. In a statement to AMs, he said the issues raised about Caldicot and Wentlooge board do not "reflect the culture or standards of public service that we have a right to expect from any public body". "It is clear from the report that it lacked some of the necessary governance controls, checks and balances that a public body must possess," Mr Davies said "We have already consulted on the future of these bodies and in the consultation we made clear that our preferred option was to transfer the powers of the internal drainage boards to Natural Resources Wales. "I have considered responses to the consultation and have asked officials to look at the costs, benefits and risks of a transfer to Natural Resources Wales, alongside other options. "This work is well advanced, and I expect to announce my decision on the future of these boards in the next month." </body>

      <title>MPs' housing benefit changes warning</title>
      <description>Changes to housing benefit - described by critics as the "bedroom tax" - will cause potential problems in Wales, a cross-party committee of MPs is warning.</description>

      <body>Changes to housing benefit - described by critics as the "bedroom tax" - will cause potential problems in Wales, a cross-party MPs' committee has warned. The reforms mean housing association and council tenants see benefits cut if they are deemed to have spare bedrooms. But the Welsh Affairs Committee fears there is a shortage of smaller homes available for rent for those looking to downsize. The UK government said money would be made available for the most vulnerable. Since April the reform has meant a 14% cut in benefits for one spare room and 25% for two. Around 40,000 tenants in Wales are affected by the changes which mean they must choose between losing some of their benefit or moving to a smaller home. But according to the committee, there could be a shortage of one and two-bedroom homes for those who wanted to find smaller properties. The MPs said in the report: "We recommend that the government issue discretionary guidance on the appropriate size of bedrooms in social rented sector accommodation. "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) must closely monitor whether local authorities are struggling to find alternative smaller accommodation for tenants who wish to downsize. "If this is so, we urge the government to undertake a speedy review of this policy." It said the DWP should also monitor "whether the movement of tenants to smaller accommodation in the private rented sector leads to long-term savings in housing benefit expenditure". It added that renting privately may prove more expensive and the government's assertion that the under-occupancy policy would reduce rent prices in the private housing sector had yet to be proved. It called for direct rent controls in the private sector which would prevent rents from going above a certain level. The report says: "We acknowledge that one of the main reasons for recent increases in the housing benefit bill and projected further increases is inflation in private housing sector rents. "Efforts to control housing benefit increases therefore have to include strategies to manage spiralling rents in the private rented sector, including direct rent controls." This recommendation was endorsed by the committee, despite the opposition of its chairman, Monmouth MP David Davies, and fellow Conservatives Guto Bebb and Glyn Davies. Last week, Mr Davies told BBC Wales the housing benefit reforms were not working as well in Wales as in London or Birmingham but he still backed their introduction. Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) welfare reform spokesman and Swansea councillor David Phillips said: "I have met many of my local residents to talk through the challenges that these reforms are creating for them, and what is plainly obvious in most cases is that the bedroom tax reform places some of our most vulnerable residents under severe financial pressure, while offering them no viable way to change or improve their situation. "There are simply not enough smaller properties for people to move to. "We hope that the UK government will consider and learn from the findings of this report as they review the impact of their policies and implement other aspects of welfare reform," he added. A DWP spokesperson said: "Housing benefit continues to pay the vast majority of people's rent, but the taxpayer can no longer afford to cover the costs of spare bedrooms. "However, we have made £6.2m available to Welsh councils to support vulnerable people, with an additional £880,000 available to help those in rural parts of Wales." The committee said it wanted to know what the definition of "vulnerable" tenants was. Charity Community Housing Cymru said the report's findings echoed its own concerns. </body>

      <title>Crime falls 7% to record low - ONS</title>
      <description>Crime in England and Wales fell 7% in the year to June - a record low - official figures show.</description>

      <body>Crime has fallen 7% to a record low in the last year, the Crime Survey for England and Wales has shown. There were 8.5m incidents in the year to the end of June, compared with 9.1m the previous year. The drop comes despite a 9% rise in sexual offences, which was partly driven by the Jimmy Savile revelations of abuse. Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said England and Wales are safer than they have been "for decades". The headline crime figure is the lowest since the survey began in 1981, and has now fallen to half its peak level, recorded in 1995. However, the Office for National Statistics, which collates the survey, said the number of historical sexual offences - those which took place more than 20 years ago - recorded by the police has doubled. The Savile inquiry has encouraged greater numbers of people to report historical sexual offence to the police. The ONS said that in the last five years there has been a 35% rise in the number of rape offences recorded by the police - partly due to new guidance on the way in which such crimes are recorded. An increase in theft was also recorded by the Crime Survey, with offences up by 8% in the last year. Evidence suggests the rise was driven by the theft of smart phones, and involve pick-pocketing rather than violence or threats. The majority are counted as stealth thefts - where the victim is unaware items are being stolen. Meanwhile, though credit card fraud levels remained flat, overall fraud offences have jumped by 21% in the last year. The ONS said the cause of this rise would become clearer in the next one or two years, but it could be down to a new centralised method of recording fraud. Max Chambers, head of crime and justice at the think-tank Policy Exchange, said: "Whether you believe it's as the result of an ageing population, better policing and prevention, or the impact of the internet, there is little doubt that Britain is becoming a safer place to live, do business and raise a family. "But crime is still too high and there are pockets of the country which remain blighted by anti-social behaviour and gang activity. "While the latest figures show that the police have been able to cut crime substantially even with fewer resources, they must now redouble their efforts to tackle the hardcore of prolific offenders who commit offences that can often disproportionately hit the poor and the vulnerable." While welcoming falling crime rates, Jon Collins, deputy director of the Police Foundation - an independent policing think-tank - said it was important not to be "blind to new and emerging challenges". He said: "The police and the government should be wary of resting on their laurels. "While crimes such as burglary and car crime are clearly not the problem that they once were, it's possible that the official crime figures are just not picking up the extent to which new opportunities for crimes like fraud and counterfeiting have emerged, particularly online." Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said: "Police reform is working and crime is falling. "This is really positive news. Forces are rising to the challenge of making savings whilst cutting crime and delivering a better service to the public. "England and Wales are safer than they have been for decades but we will continue to deliver measures which keep pace with the changing nature of crime and improve our ability to combat emerging issues." The Crime Survey for England and Wales asks people aged 16 and over living in households in England and Wales about their experiences of crime in the last 12 months. These experiences are used to estimate levels of crime in England and Wales. </body>

      <title>Coleman should commit, says Yorath</title>
      <description>Former Wales manager Terry Yorath calls on current boss Chris Coleman to speak out if he wants to continue in the role.</description>

      <body>Former Wales manager Terry Yorath has called on current boss Chris Coleman to speak out if he wants to continue in the role. Coleman has said he has not decided if he wants to carry on as manager after his contract expires in November. But Yorath wants Coleman to make his feelings known before November's friendly against Finland. "I think Chris should stay with the job and I think the Welsh FA should back him," he said. Wales ended their World Cup qualifying campaign on a high with a 1-0 win over Macedonia and a 1-1 draw in Belgium. Football Association of Wales chief executive Jonathan Ford had stated Coleman's new contract would not hinge solely on the final two World Cup qualifiers. The FAW has been in ongoing contract talks with the 43-year-old, who was appointed in January 2012 on a two-and-a-half-year contract following the death of Gary Speed. Yorath was Coleman's club manager at Swansea City before he handed the defender his international debut against Austria in 1992. "I've talked to Chris, I think three times in the last 10 days, and he sounds to me as if he's a bit unsure about his situation," Yorath added. "During my talks with him he was telling me certain things that were happening and I felt he was unsure whether he wanted to keep the job. "I think if he wants to keep the job he has to come out and say that. "It's the best job you'll ever have, managing your country, and he has to come out and say he wants to do it." Yorath was Wales manager for five years and led the national side to the brink of the 1994 World Cup finals in the United States. Following Wales' failure to qualify, Yorath's contract was not renewed by the FAW in December 1993. And the former Leeds United midfielder has every sympathy for Coleman as he waits for clarity from the FAW about his future. "Dealing with the Welsh FA is, at the most, awkward because you've got people who think they know everything about football but don't know anything about it," Yorath added. "They don't understand the situation the manager's in. "The manager's in a situation where two or three days before a game players pull out. You can't do anything about that. It's not like a club job. "I think the last two games Chris has done ever so well. The game against Belgium I thought Wales played excellent. "I honestly thought before the game Wales were going to get hammered and I probably wasn't the only one. "But they played well, stuck it out and got a draw and a great result for Chris." </body>

      <description>Swansea City full-back Angel Rangel is wary of the effect appointing a new manager may have on Saturday's opponents Sunderland.</description>

      <body>Swansea defender Angel Rangel has said his side must be aware of the effect that having a new manager will have on Saturday's opponents Sunderland. Gus Poyet was appointed as the Black Cats' new boss last week and the trip to the Liberty Stadium will be his first game in charge of the bottom-placed team. "When you get a new manager in a situation like this all the players are going to give probably an extra 100 per cent," he told BBC Wales' Sport Wales. "They need to prove themselves to him." However the Swans right-back says the visitors will not face a comfortable afternoon. "Swansea is not an easy place to come and hopefully we can play our own game and win it," he said. "We know that at home we haven't won a game for a while so we have to start, because in the Premier League I think the most important thing is the home form and we have to start against Sunderland. "I have seen a few of their games, especially the last one against Manchester United. You can see the players are fighting for their lives and are giving everything they can. "But when you are in that situation at the bottom of the table, because of the pressure you are under, you are not playing with your best qualities and they have been a bit unfortunate. "So I think we are going to have to try to take advantage of that and try to beat them." Swansea are currently 15th in the Premier League table with seven points - which puts them level with the three teams immediately below them including Norwich, who are in the relegation zone. However Rangel is not worried about the side's form so far this season. "I know it looks like not the best of starts but we are realistic. We know that we had a very difficult start against top teams like Manchester United, Tottenham, Arsenal and Liverpool so obviously that shows you it is difficult to get points against these teams. "But we got a draw against Liverpool and then we beat the teams that we really needed to beat which is Crystal Palace and West Brom. "These are the teams in the same league as us so now we've got a great chance to beat Sunderland and West Ham at home and I think they are two massive games for us." Swansea hope Ben Davies will be fit to face Sunderland but captain Ashley Williams remains doubtful. Both defenders missed Wales's World Cup qualifiers against Macedonia and Belgium because of hamstring and ankle injuries respectively. More on Sport Wales, Friday at 19:00 BST, BBC Two Wales </body>

      <body>Ospreys will be without lock Ian Evans for their Heineken Cup match at Northampton Saints on Sunday. The British and Irish Lions star Evans misses out with an Achilles problem, after being dropped for the Ospreys' home defeat to Leinster last weekend. Wing Ben John also misses out with the groin problem he picked up in the 19-9 loss, so Jeff Hassler replaces him. Scrum-half Tom Habberfield replaces Tito Tebaldi for the trip to the East Midlands. Coach Steve Tandy said the Ospreys squad were determined to turn things around after failing to even get a losing bonus point against Leinster. "It was pretty disappointing to say the least. It was an amazing occasion for us but we felt we let ourselves down," he said. "We need to get back on the horse and get ready to go Sunday. "We were bitterly disappointed with our performance and it wasn't the performance we have come to expect from the Ospreys. "We have to learn from it and we have got an amazing game coming up against Northampton. It's a good week to turn things around." Although Northampton also lost their opening game 19-13 in Castres, the English side are second in the Aviva Premiership and can field the likes of Wales and Lions wing George North and former Ospreys scrum-half Kahn Fotuali'i. Ospreys prop Adam Jones is set to be up against his Lions front-row colleague Alex Corbisiero. "We know it's going to be a tough task going to Northampton but it's something we are excited about doing. "They are a big physical pack and obviously they have some pretty big backs as well. "It's going to be a physical contest. We win and lose as a group and we can't wait for Sunday.

      <description>Will cutting numbers save as much as people expect?</description>

      <body>Councils the length and breadth of Wales are now trying to work out the best ways of dealing with unprecedented cuts. The option of reducing the number of local authorities, perhaps drastically, seems an obvious one. First Minister Carwyn Jones has again stated, in interviews with the BBC and the Western Mail, that 22 councils is too much, and he looks forward to seeing the recommendations of a commission considering the matter, which is due to report at the end of the year. Earlier this week, senior Cardiff councillor Russell Goodway suggested some councils could go bust as the impact of budget cuts mount, raising the prospect of the numbers falling regardless of any deliberate reorganisation. While Wales might not have been here before in terms of the scale of the financial cutbacks, the business of restructuring local councils is quite a well-trodden path. The current 22 councils were created in the mid-1990s. They replaced a two-tier structure made up of district and county councils, which had been established by another local government reorganisation in 1974. Two decades ago it was argued single, unitary authorities were more efficient - cutting out a layer of bureaucracy and making it simpler for people to understand who was providing their public services. No longer did one council empty your bins while another local authority educated your child. The argument was that if you had a complaint you knew where to go. Now it is said that many of these councils are just too small to deal with areas such as education and social services, although it isn't just the smaller authorities that have been criticised for the quality of their services in these two crucial areas. Prof Steve Martin and the team at Cardiff Business School's Centre for Local and Regional Government Research know a thing or two about these matters, having looked at evidence from council reorganisations around the globe. "Usually, when people undertake them, they hope for and anticipate quite significant cost savings," he said. "Studies in Australia, Canada and England show that whilst you can get cost savings, particularly in the longer term, they've never been on the scale that people have hoped for. "So one lesson, not to be too gloomy about this, is not to over expect in terms of cost savings." Prof Martin says it takes around five years for reorganisations to bed down. Restructuring which has taken place in England was slightly different from what might happen in Wales, involving two-tier authorities becoming unitary councils, but he says there was often evidence of a "performance dip" in the short term. So, while the savings can take time to appear, the hiatus of reorganising a council, turning it into a new organisation, people applying for their own jobs and so on tends to affect authorities' ability to run services as well as they might. "You overlay on that the very difficult financial environment that we're in at the moment and all of that says, therefore, that this is not something to be undertaken lightly." "Having said all of that, it's pretty clear that there are some authorities in Wales that have struggled in recent years, and the number of interventions that the government has initiated sort of bears testimony to that, and so does some of the performance data. "And therefore it would be wrong to say that we can be confident that the current 22 are performing as well as we might want them to". Yet Prof Martin says it isn't clear whether big, small or medium is the right size for a local authority. Some sizes are better for some services but not for others - one of the reasons why we used to have two different sizes of councils, in addition to community councils. "Do you want local government to continue to be responsible for education and social care - because if you don't then that drives you towards a pretty large number of small authorities - if you do there is quite a compelling case for a smaller number of larger authorities?" he said. Prof Martin reckons Wales is roughly the size of two or three large English county councils, in population terms, so does it makes sense for us to have 22 of them? "There are quite a lot of countries where governance is working quite well - some of the Scandinavian countries would have far larger numbers of councils which are smaller," he said. "But they are not responsible for education and social services - education and social services would be run by a higher tier of government - either a state-level government or the national government or county councils." Debating whether our local government structure is right or wrong has long been a past time for people like me who probably should get out more. Whatever is decided in Wales, the hope is that we won't be returning to these arguments soon after any changes are finally made. But it would take a braver man than me to bet on that being the case. </body>

      <title>Actor's anger over mural demolition</title>
      <description>Hollywood star's criticism of destruction of Chartist mural</description>

      <body>Hollywood actor Michael Sheen has strongly criticised Newport council which "destroyed" a mural celebrating the 1839 Chartist uprising. The star, who was born in Newport, has written a letter to the South Wales Argus to say: "The political system has let us down." The 35m (115ft) mosaic was demolished this month to make way for a £100m shopping centre, prompting protests. The council said it did not have the money to move or preserve the mural. The diggers moved in to tear down the artwork in a subway off John Frost Square on 3 October, a fortnight after Welsh heritage body Cadw declined to list the mosaic. The council's chief executive Will Godfrey later apologised for not giving councillors advance warning that the mural would be demolished. As workmen chipped away at the mosaic, which was created in 1978, protesters staged an impromptu demonstration. It was followed by a demonstration of about 200 people the following day who were angry at the council's actions. Sheen, star of films including Frost/Nixon, The Queen and the Twilight series, has now written an open letter to the South Wales Argus. In it, he urges people to "stand up for certain values and freedoms and ideals when they come under attack, whether through greed, malice, ignorance or sheer stupidity". He said he felt compelled to write for a number of reasons. "Firstly, the vicious irony of something that was created to celebrate those who risked much for the good of all, being wiped out without consulting the people themselves, and under the auspices of a Labour led city council serving the needs of profit above all else, is both absurd as well as tragic," he said. "That so little was done, or was able to be done, by us, in order to stop this from happening, brings shame to us all." He also urged action to ensure the Chartist movement was not forgotten in the city, urging the community to come together with ideas to replace the mural. "Having done something similar when working on The Passion [a three-day open air play with the community in Port Talbot] a few years ago, I was amazed and inspired by the vision, commitment and resourcefulness of the design students I worked with," he added. "Looking for found materials to work with, along with as much of the original destroyed mural as can be salvaged, could connect the past with the present in a grounded and economical way perhaps." He concluded: "I hope we can make the Chartists proud." Sheen was born in Newport and his family lived in Llanmartin in the county for 12 years before moving to Port Talbot when the actor was five. His father Meyrick Sheen, whose brother still lives in Newport, said he was not surprised his son had gotten involved. He told BBC Wales that Sheen had previously opened a Chartists' exhibition in the city's museum. The council has said it is looking at options to replace the mural, which depicted a fatal confrontation between democracy protesters and troops at Newport's Westgate Hotel in 1839 In his letter earlier this month, Mr Godfrey said he had attempted to contact local media to alert them about the demolition. "The process was not underhand or undemocratic as has been suggested in some parts of the media," he said. He went on: "Officers have advised the appropriate cabinet member that consultation should commence as soon as possible. 'Difficult decisions' "It is suggested that one of the options should be to commission a replica of the original mural." In response to the Hollywood star's letter, Newport council said it did not have the money to move or preserve the mural. "The mural's future has been on public record since March 2012, when a planning decision and separate public consultation confirmed that the mural would have to be demolished and the preferred option as a result of the consultation was for it to be reproduced on tiles," said a spokesperson. "More recently, as Cadw did not list the mural and Newport City Council did not have £625,000 to remove and preserve it, we understand that these decisions have been difficult for Newport residents both near and far. "The council found Mr Sheen's letter very interesting. It is forward thinking and contains some practical suggestions which the council will consider. "We also echo Mr Sheen's call to 'focus on how we can celebrate the past, connect it to the present and look hopefully to the future.' "We are currently asking all members of the public to give us their views on a new commemoration of the Chartists, details of which are on the council's website." </body>

      <description>Charred bodies pulled from the rubble of Kenya's Westgate shopping centre are "highly likely" to be those of two of the gunmen, an MP tells the BBC.</description>

      <body>Two charred bodies pulled from Kenya's Westgate shopping centre on Thursday are "highly likely" to be two of the attackers, an MP has told the BBC. Ndung'u Gethenji, chairman of the committee investigating the attack, said AK47 rifles used by the militants were found next to the bodies. The authorities will now conduct forensic tests on the bodies. At least 67 people died when suspected al-Shabab militants stormed the Nairobi shopping centre on 21 September. The attack sparked a four-day siege in which large parts of the shopping centre were destroyed. The Kenyan authorities have released the names, or nicknames, of four suspects in the attack, but have given few other details. The Kenya Red Cross lists 23 people as still missing. Mr Gethenji said the bodies recovered on Thursday were likely to be militants because the army does not use AK47s. He said another body recovered from the rubble was likely to be a soldier. It is still not clear whether some of the attackers might have escaped, or even how many attackers there were. Officials initially said 10 to 15 gunmen were involved, but CCTV footage appears to show only four militants. The BBC's Newsnight programme has revealed that one of the suspected attackers is a 23-year-old Somalia-born Norwegian national, Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow. His family fled to Norway in the 1990s, but he returned to Somalia in 2009 and allegedly joined the Somali militant group. Sources in al-Shabab have told the BBC Somali Service that Dhuhulow attended a training camp in El Bur in central Somalia, one of the militants' main bases. The sources said Dhuhulow took part in many al-Shabab operations in Mogadishu and Kismayo and was well-known in jihadist circles. Journalist Zubayr Roble in Oslo told the BBC that Dhuhulow frequented the Towfiq Mosque in the Norwegian capital. Mr Roble said Somalis at the mosque for Friday prayers were in shock about the revelations and anxious over the possible implications the case could have for the Somali community in Norway. Martin Bernsen, an officer in Norway's Security Service, told the BBC's World At One programme that Norwegian authorities had opened an investigation into the involvement of a Norwegian citizen in the attack "about one week ago". "We are trying to find out his role and what his connections are. We don't know if he alive or if he is dead." When asked if the authorities had previously been aware of any previous similar activity among Somalis in Norway, Mr Bernsen said; "It's not the Somalis we're worried about, it's the criminal element. "We are aware that there are some activities. We have challenges in Norway regarding both al-Shabab and al-Qaeda. Al-Shabab was first known in Norway in 2007 when we investigated money transfer to al-Shabab". Mr Bernsen said Norwegian authorities were also concerned about people travelling to "conflict areas", including Syria and Somalia, particularly in the past year. The BBC's Will Ross in Nairobi says Kenyans still feel there are a lot of unanswered questions, and will be shocked if it turns out that just four gunmen caused such havoc. The Somali militant group al-Shabab said its members staged the attack in response to Kenya's army carrying out operations on Somali territory. There are about 4,000 Kenyan troops in the south of Somalia, where they have been fighting the militants since 2011. Uganda also has troops in Somalia, and the authorities have issued an alert and stepped up security after the US embassy warned of reports of a possible "Westgate-style attack" in Kampala. The Ugandan police said in a tweet: "Stay alert and watch each other's steps and activities, as we are still threatened by terror." Al-Shabab has carried out attacks in Kampala before, most notoriously a double suicide-attack that killed more than 70 people in 2010. Meanwhile, several British Muslims have been put under police protection because of a "credible threat" against them. Al-Shabab militants apparently singled out Mohammed Ansar and other Muslim commentators in a video that condemned those who spoke out against extremism. The Islamist group, which is believed to have between 7,000 and 9,000 fighters, controls large parts of Somalia. Al-Shabab is fighting to create an Islamic state in Somalia and is banned as a terrorist group by both the US and the UK, </body>

      <description>Saudi Arabia turns down a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council, accusing the world body of "double standards".</description>

      <body>Saudi Arabia has turned down a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, accusing the world body of "double standards". The Saudi foreign ministry said the UN needs to be reformed first. It said the Security Council had failed in its duties towards Syria as well as in other world conflicts. Saudi Arabia has previously expressed frustration at what it sees as an international failure to act on Syria, where it staunchly backs the rebels. There has been no official reaction from the UN, but diplomats there expressed surprise at Riyadh's announcement. Russia's foreign ministry called the move bewildering, and said Saudi Arabia's criticism of the UN Security Council about its actions over Syria "is particularly strange". The announcement came hours after Saudi Arabia was elected for the first time to one of the 10 rotating seats on the Security Council. The non-permanent members sit on the council for two years, along with the five permanent members - the US, the UK, France, China and Russia. "Work mechanisms and double-standards on the Security Council prevent it from carrying out its duties and assuming its responsibilities in keeping world peace," the Saudi foreign ministry said in a statement. "Therefore Saudi Arabia... has no other option but to turn down Security Council membership until it is reformed and given the means to accomplish its duties and assume its responsibilities in preserving the world's peace and security," it added. The failure "to find a solution to the Palestinian cause for 65 years" had led to "numerous wars that have threatened world peace," the foreign ministry said. It also criticised the UN's "failure" to rid the Middle East region of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons. And it accused the UN of allowing the Syrian government "to kill its own people with chemical weapons... without confronting it or imposing any deterrent sanctions". The UN Security Council last month finally broke a two-and-a-half year deadlock on how to deal with conflict in Syria after voting unanimously to adopt a binding resolution on ridding the country of chemical weapons. Saudi observers say Riyadh would have been working for years to gain a place on the UN Security Council, so such a decision would have to have been made at the very top of the kingdom's leadership. One Security Council diplomat, quoted by AFP, said the announcement was "totally unexpected" and without precedent. Another said: "There was nothing controversial about the election. But the government has made it clear in recent weeks that it is concerned about Syria and the Palestine issue." </body>

      <title>US pressed over drone attack data</title>
      <description>A UN investigator, Ben Emmerson, calls on the US to provide greater transparency about its drone strikes and civilian casualties.</description>

      <body>A United Nations investigator has called on the US to make public its data about drone strikes and civilian casualties. Ben Emmerson has spent the year travelling to countries where the strikes have taken place, and speaking to US officials. He says the involvement of the CIA creates "an almost insurmountable obstacle to transparency". In Pakistan he was told at least 400 civilians had been killed since 2004. The Obama administration's policy of using drones in places such as Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen - chiefly to carry out deadly missile attacks against suspected militants - has come under increasing criticism. Mr Emmerson, a British lawyer who acts as the UN special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, has prepared an interim report for the UN's Human Rights Council on his work since January 2013. In the report he writes that he cannot accept that national security considerations justify the US withholding its own data on civilian casualties from the pilotless operations. He also says there a number of legal questions relating to the use of drones which urgently need to be resolved internationally. However he does conclude that, if used in compliance with humanitarian law, remotely piloted aircraft are capable of reducing the risk of civilian casualties in armed conflict. The BBC's security correspondent, Gordon Corera, says the fear highlighted in Mr Emmerson's report is that without any consensus on how drones could be used, their use will become increasingly widespread and dangerous. Drones may be controversial, but the signs are that they are here to stay and many more countries may begin to use them, our correspondent adds. </body>

      <body>Militants have attacked a heavily-fortified international compound on the outskirts of the Afghan capital, Kabul, security sources say. The attack started when a car exploded at the gate of the compound, known as Green Village, which houses international diplomats and military contractors. A woman and up to four children in a car that was passing were killed. Security guards then exchanged gunfire with insurgents, who were overpowered. Some reports say the militants managed to get inside the compound. Military officials said the explosion outside the compound destroyed vehicles belonging to international forces. There are no reports of any international casualties. The attack began when a suicide bomber in a car detonated explosives as a foreign convoy was leaving the Green Village. Most of the residents are contractors working as security guards for international agencies. Green Village was last attacked by a car bomb in May 2012, killing eight. </body>

      <body>Police in India say they have arrested the crew of a US-owned ship accused of illegally entering Indian waters with a huge cache of weapons on board. Officials say MV Seaman Guard Ohio was detained on 12 October by the Indian Coast Guard and is currently anchored at a port in southern Tamil Nadu state. Its 35-member crew include Indians, Britons, Ukrainians and Estonians. The ship's owner, AdvanFort, said the vessel was involved in supporting anti-piracy operations in the Indian Ocean. But there have been differing accounts of the chain of events from the Indian authorities and the US-based security firm. The Indian authorities say they intercepted the American ship last weekend when it was reportedly sailing off the coast of Tamil Nadu. Police also said they found weapons and ammunition on board, which had not been properly declared. Officials say the vessel was not authorised to carry arms in Indian waters and that it never produced the necessary paperwork. But in a statement released on Monday, AdvanFort said India's coast guard and police allowed the vessel to enter the port to refuel and shelter from a cyclone which hit India's eastern coast last weekend. The company even thanked officials. It added that all weaponry and equipment on board was properly registered. In recent years piracy has emerged as a major threat to merchant ships in the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea, with ships and their crews sometimes hijacked for ransom. There have been fewer attacks recently, partly because more armed guards are now deployed on board. On Friday, police said that 33 crew members had been taken to a local police station for questioning. Two had been allowed to remain on the vessel in port at Tuticorin. Six of the crew members are Britons and the British high commission in Delhi said consular officials had been in touch with them by email and with the local authorities, but they were still trying to clarify exactly what had happened and on what grounds they had been detained. The US embassy told the BBC it had "no comment" to make. According to AdvanFort there were privately contracted security personnel on board the Sierra-Leone registered MV Seaman Guard Ohio. It said that as these men routinely provide counter-piracy protection they also had uniforms, protective equipment, medical kits, rifles and ammunition - "all of which is properly registered and licensed to AdvanFort". The company added that the vessel "provides an accommodations platform for AdvanFort's counter-piracy guards between transits on client commercial vessels transiting the high risk area". Analysts say that anti-piracy measures on high-risk shipping routes are poorly regulated and India is increasingly sensitive to violations of its maritime boundaries. India directly supports the multi-national campaign to combat the mostly Somali pirates targeting ships in the Indian Ocean with its own navy. But it's been controversial too, with the Indian authorities prosecuting two Italian marines on anti-piracy duty for allegedly shooting two fishermen inside Indian waters last year. They were guarding an Italian oil tanker and said they mistook the fishermen for pirates. </body>

      <body>Masked gunmen have shot dead a Libyan military police commander in the city of Benghazi, officials have said. Ahmed al-Barghathi, the head of the military police's investigative division, was shot several times as he left his house for Friday prayers. No group has admitted carrying out the attack. Many security officials have been targeted by gunmen since the end of the 2011 war that toppled Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's government. In the past year alone, more than 80 people, many of whom were high-profile military and police figures or retired army generals, have been assassinated in eastern Libya. The BBC's Rana Jawad in the capital, Tripoli, says no-one ever admits carrying out the killings. and arrests are rarely made. Earlier this week two members of an infantry brigade were killed following an attack on their base in Benghazi. Local media reported that their throats were slit. And in the eastern city of Derna on Thursday morning, a local army commander widely known for his role in leading an anti-Gaddafi brigade was shot dead. Mr Barghathi was one of many officials who rose to prominence after fighting against Gaddafi's forces. He was reportedly on holiday in Benghazi when he was shot. "Several shots hit Ahmed al-Barghathi. He was brought to hospital but later died there," a security source said. Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan recently called on Western powers to help stop the spread of militancy in Libya. </body>

      <body>Australian fire fighters are battling a series of major wildfires in New South Wales, with fears that hundreds of homes have been destroyed. The blazes are continuing to burn on the outskirts of Sydney, despite the easing of temperatures and winds. One man has died while trying to protect his home. Prime Minister Tony Abbott visited Winmalee in the Blue Mountains, one of the areas worst-hit by the fires, around 70km (45 miles) west of Sydney. Correspondents say bushfires are common in Australia but they have come earlier than normal this year, sparking concerns of further problems to come. Minister for Police and Emergency Services Michael Gallacher told the BBC that "the speed and the ferocity" of the fires was something "not seen for many, many years". "We had one fire front that changed direction and had a front to it, so if you can imagine, burning in one direction 25km [15 miles] wide." "We're only now in the process of being able to return to some of the sites to check the magnitude of the losses and I've got to say, it's going to be quite substantial," he added. Hundreds of residents spent Thursday night in evacuation centres, with many returning home to find their houses razed. Fire fighters described blazes as tall as 20m to 30m (100ft). A 63-year-old man died from a heart attack as he tried to defend his home in Lake Munmorah, in the Central Coast region of NSW, on Thursday afternoon. Around 2,000 fire fighters across the state worked to try and contain the fires but many are still burning out of control, says the BBC's Jon Donnison. Mr Abbott, in Winmalee, said of those helping to battle the fires: "These are ordinary people who, on an extraordinary day, come together to support their community and to protect their fellow Australians." At least three fire fighters have been reported injured. The NSW Rural Fire Service said an initial assessment of the Winmalee and Springwood areas showed that 81 properties had been destroyed, with 37 damaged. "Approximately 30% of the fireground has been assessed," it said. "The number of properties destroyed or damaged will rise." Reports estimate that as many as 200 homes could be lost in total. The fires have been caused by unseasonably hot temperatures and strong winds. While these have now died down, more hot weather is forecast next week. "It's been an awful 24 hours for the Blue Mountains [region]," Mayor Mark Greenhill told Nine Network Television. "We've lost possibly scores of homes." Ron Fuller, who lost his home in Winmalee, told ABC News: "We've had a number of fires through here before but this was an extraordinary fire. The speed was extraordinary, it just raced through this whole area, took out some houses, left other ones standing." Jodie Harrison, Mayor of Lake Macquarie, said that four heritage homes, as well as a historic jetty, were caught in the fire. "It's been confirmed that four houses in the heritage village of Catherine Hill Bay have been lost," she told local media. NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell, in an interview on broadcaster 7 News, called the fires "some of the worst we have experienced around Sydney in living memory". "We're in for a long, tough summer," he added. Alex Chesser, a District Officer with the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, told the BBC that the fires had come unusually early. "It's... a combination of a couple years of quite wet summers and winters which have allowed the bush to continue to grow at high rates, and also prevented us undertaking as many hazard reduction burns as we'd like," he said. Smoke and ash from the wildfires blanketed the Sydney skyline on Thursday. New South Wales was also hit by bush fires in September, which injured several fire fighters.

      <body>China's economic growth picked up pace in the July-to-September period, the first rise in three quarters. The world's second-biggest economy grew 7.8% from a year earlier, up from 7.5% expansion in the previous quarter. The official figures also showed growth in industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment. After years of blistering growth, China has seen its pace of expansion slow recently and there have been fears that growth may slow further. China has set a growth target of 7.5% for the year. Analysts said the latest numbers indicated that it was likely that Beijing would meet this. "This is an indication that China's economic growth is holding up in a range which is within the comfort zone of both the Chinese policymakers as well as global watchers," said Song Seng Wun, a senior economist with CIMB Research . Over the past few decades China has relied heavily on its exports and manufacturing sectors as well as government-led infrastructure spending to help boost growth. However, a slowdown in key markets such as the US and Europe has hurt demand for its exports. As a result, it has been trying to spur domestic demand to offset the decline in foreign sales and also to rebalance its growth. Earlier this year, it unveiled fresh measures to help boost the economy. From 1 August, China has suspend value-added tax (VAT) and turnover tax for small businesses with monthly sales of less than 20,000 yuan ($3,257; £2,125). The cabinet said the move would benefit more than six million small companies and boost employment and income for millions of people. Policymakers said they would also implement measures to simplify customs clearance procedures, cut operational fees and facilitate the exports of small and medium-sized private enterprises. The cabinet also announced plans to completely open China's railway construction market to private investors to develop the sector further. It said it would set up a railway development fund, with the initial money coming from the government. Analysts said the moves were starting to have an impact on the growth numbers. "There is certainly a build up of momentum among the small manufacturers, which is an indication that China's policies targeted at them are working," said Tony Nash, vice-president at IHS. Factory output rose 10.2% in September, from a year earlier. Meanwhile, retail sales rose 13.3% and fixed asset investment jumped 20.2% during the month from levels a year ago. Tim Condon of ING added that the measures may help China sustain its growth rate in the current quarter as well. "The mini-stimulus we've seen is enough to keep it going at this pace in the fourth quarter," Mr Condon said. However, there have been some concerns over whether the economic rebound is sustainable in the long run, not least due to the continued rise in property prices. Property prices have now risen for eight months in a row, despite government efforts to cool the market. Some analysts have said that China's new leaders, who took charge in March, have so far tolerated the price rises due to concerns over slowing economic growth. According to some estimates, about 25% of overall investment in China goes towards property, making it one of the most important growth sectors. But the continued surge in prices has fanned fears that asset bubbles may be forming. "Between real estate and the lending environment, there are concerns that things may be heating up," said Mr Nash of IHS. "If not addressed properly, and in time, it could pose a serious threat to China's growth." Analysts said that with growth rebounding, Beijing may take measures to try and curb speculation in the property market. "We think the recovery in the third quarter was mainly driven by the strong momentum of the property market," said Shen Jianguang, chief China economist with Mizuho Securities in Hong Kong. "The government concerns about an over-heated property market are increasing, and tougher measures to curb rising prices may be forthcoming. "We expect gross domestic product (GDP) growth will slow to 7.6% in the fourth quarter," he added. </body>

      <title>No secret files in Russia - Snowden</title>
      <description>US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden says he took no classified documents to Russia when he fled there from Hong Kong.</description>

      <body>US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden has insisted he took no classified documents to Russia when he fled to Moscow from Hong Kong in June. He told the New York Times he had given all the papers to journalists in Hong Kong and had kept no copies. Mr Snowden, who worked for two US spy agencies, also said no confidential information had been passed to China. The US authorities want Mr Snowden extradited to face trial, but Russia has refused to hand him over. The Russian authorities gave him a one-year visa earlier this year after he claimed asylum. Mr Snowden told the US newspaper that he did not take any of the documents because it would not have been in the public interest. "What would be the unique value of personally carrying another copy of the materials onward," he said. Claims had surfaced in media reports that China was likely to have gained some intelligence from the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor before he left Hong Kong. Some analysts had suggested he was working with Chinese intelligence, while others said he was working with the Russians. But Mr Snowden rebuffed these claims, saying: "There's a zero per cent chance the Russians or Chinese have received any documents." He said his last job for the NSA had focused on China, and he had "access to every target", so he felt confident that the data was safe from Chinese agencies. The New York Times report said its interview was conducted over several days via encrypted networks. The information leaked by Mr Snowden has led to claims of systematic spying by the NSA and CIA on a global scale of governments, businesses and members of the public. Targets have included rivals like China and Russia, as well as close allies like the EU and Brazil. The NSA was also forced to admit it captured email and phone data from millions of Americans. </body>

      <body>Four men have been charged with the rape and murder of two toddlers in the South African township of Diepsloot, north of Johannesburg. A fifth suspect was arrested on Friday after police issued an identikit photo. His arrest sparked violent protests outside a police station in Diepsloot as hundreds of demonstrators demanded he be handed over to the crowd. Police fired rubber bullets to disperse those who had blocked a road, were throwing stones and burning tyres. The bodies of two girls, aged two and three, were found dumped in community toilets on Tuesday morning. The girls, who were cousins, went missing on Saturday from outside their home while playing with friends. Earlier this week, President Jacob Zuma urged people not to take the law into their own hands. </body>

      <body>The head of Dr Oetker - one of the world's biggest frozen pizza makers - has revealed the family firm's links to Germany's Nazi party. Company chairman August Oetker was speaking ahead of a new book that studies the history of the family's links with the Nazis. His father, Rudolf-August Oetker, was a member of Adolf Hitler's Waffen SS. Rudolf-August Oetker ran the company, based in Bielefeld, northern Germany, after World War II and died in 2007. "My father was a National Socialist," August Oetker said in an interview with Die Zeit newspaper. "He didn't want to talk about this time. He said, 'children, leave me in peace'." He said his father, who had joined the Nazi party in the 1930s, had been influenced by his step-father, Richard Kaselowsky, who was a staunch supporter of Hitler and ran Dr Oetker before him. Mr Oetker said he welcomed the publication next week of the book Dr Oetker and National Socialism, written by a German historian and funded by the company. "I feel now we know the facts, now the fog has lifted," he said. Over the decades, many German companies have come under pressure to come to terms with their links to the Nazis and their actions during the 1930s and 1940s. </body>

      <body>Guards at a prison in the Moldovan village of Pruncul have pounced on a cat being used to traffick bags of cannabis, tied around its neck. Suspicions were raised after the small grey and white creature was spotted regularly nipping in and out of the jail through a hole in a fence. Its oversize decorative collar turned out to contain drugs and investigations are under way to sniff out its trainer. Video of the cat being searched was posted by the justice ministry. A cat was recently used to smuggle mobile phones into a Russian jail. Guards caught it climbing a fence at the jail in Syktyvkar in June, the Moscow Times reported at the time, adding a photo of the creature being held by the scruff of its neck, the phones and chargers taped to its body. It was just one of several attempts discovered in recent years, with cats at other jails being used to deliver heroin, the paper noted. </body>

      <body>Canada and the European Union have struck a free trade agreement aimed at boosting growth and employment. The deal will lower tariffs, streamline regulation, and cut red tape. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso agreed the deal at a meeting in Brussels on Friday. Mr Barroso said they had reached a "breakthrough in negotiations" to achieve "a great agreement for both the European Union and Canada". The deal still requires approval by parliaments and EU member states. Once approved, the agreement aims to make it easier for companies in Canada and the 28-member EU bloc to invest in and sell to each other. The European Union is Canada's second-largest trading partner behind the US. Mr Harper said the agreement was "the biggest (trade) deal our country has ever made". It will give Canada access to a market of some 500 million people in the EU, making it bigger even than the country's North American Free Trade Agreement signed with the US and Mexico. The European Commission expects the deal to increase bilateral trade in goods and services by a fifth to 25.7bn euros ($35bn; £21.7bn) a year. The commission is negotiating trade pacts with more than 80 countries on behalf of the bloc's members following the collapse of the Doha global trade talks. </body>

      <body>A strike by workers of a major San Francisco-area rail transit system has snarled the morning commute for hundreds of thousands of workers. Overnight negotiations between the labour unions and Bay Area Rapid Transit (Bart) reached an impasse just hours before the morning rush. The city bolstered bus and ferry service to meet the demand of more than 400,000 affected commuters, and bridges and highways were clogged. It is the second Bart strike this year. Commuters lined up before dawn to catch charter buses into San Francisco, the city at the centre of the 4.3 million-population metropolitan area. City officials estimated the buses could only transport 6,000 people per day. Traffic on San Francisco's bridges also appeared heavier than normal. "They must realise how many thousands, hundreds of thousands of people they're throwing into chaos," a resident told local media. The two unions involved in the dispute represent nearly 2,400 train operators, station agents, maintenance workers and other staff. Agreement was reportedly near on Thursday on the key sticking points of pay, healthcare and pension issues, said Roxanne Sanchez, president of the Service Employees International Union Local 1021. But talks broke down just hours later, reportedly over issues including overtime scheduling. Ms Sanchez said management had rejected a union suggestion to take the remaining issues to arbitration, prompting the walkout. It is the second Bart worker strike in four months. After a previous strike in July, California Governor Jerry Brown ordered a 60-day cooling-off period, which ended on Sunday. A federal mediator has been working since then with Bart and the unions. Bart spokeswoman Alicia Trost said the rail operator had been inundated with calls and emails this week from commuters frustrated they had not been given earlier notice about whether the trains would run. </body>

      <body>Four men in Chile have been convicted of murder for torturing and beating to death a young gay man in a Santiago park earlier this year. Judge Juan Carlos Urrutia said the four killers of Daniel Zamudio showed "total disrespect for human life". They broke Mr Zamudio's leg with a heavy stone, beat him up with bottles and carved swastikas into his body with broken glass before walking away. The four are due to be sentenced on 28 October. Patricio Ahumada, Alejandro Angulo, Raul Lopez and Fabian Mora are facing lengthy prison terms. The attack shocked Chile and led Congress in March to approve a law against hate crimes that had been waiting to be voted for seven years. "It is typical of us, Chileans, that an accident has to happen for us to approve a law. My son will not come back, but this case may end up being good for Chile," said Daniel's father, Ivan Zamudio. He was in court to hear the verdict, alongside Daniel's mother, Jacqueline Vera. "Of course I will not forgive them," Ivan Zamudio told El Mercurio newspaper. Daniel Zamudio was attacked on the night of 2 March at the San Borja de Alameda park in the Chilean capital. He was left for dead after an ordeal that lasted for several hours. He was taken to hospital with serious injuries and died there 25 days later. Gay activist Rolando Jimenez, president of Chile's Gay Liberation and Integration Movement, told the Associated Press news agency that he was "satisfied" with the ruling. "There's a before and an after the Zamudio case,'' said Mr Jimenez. </body>

      <title>Brazilian oil workers on strike</title>

      <body>Oil production in Brazil has been disrupted by a strike against a planned auction for rights to explore a huge offshore oilfield near Rio de Janeiro. Union leaders say 90% of employees of the state oil company, Petrobras, joined the strike on Thursday. Forty-two platforms and several refineries have been affected. The unions say the Libra oilfield auction will damage national interests by allowing foreign companies to share production rights with Petrobras. They have taken legal action to try to halt the sale, which is due to take place on Monday. The 40,000 Petrobras employees are also demanding a pay rise and changes to plans to have some of the services contracted out to private companies. "Our aim is not to hurt the population, but we will carry on with the strike for an indefinite period, until our demands are met," said José Antonio de Moraes, president of the Unified Federation of Oil Workers (FUP). In a statement, Petrobras said it had taken "all the measures needed to guarantee operations and the supply of products to the market". There were demonstrations outside the Petrobras headquarters in Rio de Janeiro and government buildings in the capital, Brasilia. Mines and Energy Minister Edison Lobao could not reach his ministry, which was surrounded by demonstrators. "The country understands the strikes. I regret I was not able to work today. But these things happen," he said. Mr Lobao said that the auction will go ahead as planned on Monday despite the industrial action. Petrobras and six foreign companies are taking part: China National Petroleum Corporation, Anglo-Dutch Shell, Colombia's Ecopetrol, , France's Total, China National Offshore Oil Corporation and a consortium made up of Spain's Repsol and China's Sinopec . The Libra field is a deepwater oilfield in the Santos basin, some 230km (140 miles) off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. It belongs to the Brazilian National Petroleum Agency (ANP) and is part of huge oil reserves discovered in 2010 under a layer of rock, sand and salt beneath the seabed. The government estimates "the volume of recoverable oil belonging to the nation could vary from 3.7 billion to 15 billion barrels, with the most likely estimate being 7.9 billion barrels". National Petroleum Agency president Magda Chambriard said she expected production to peak in Libra at 1.4 million barrels a day in a decade. </body>

      <body>Angry members of Tunisia's security forces have driven President Moncef Marzouki and Prime Minister Ali Larayedh from a memorial ceremony for two policeman killed by militants. Protesters, some in uniform, shouted "go away" at the leaders during the ceremony at a Tunis military barracks. The leaders left after being jeered, without making any speeches. The BBC's Sihem Hassaini in Tunis says security forces are angry, feeling they lack the resources to combat jihadists. They have been battling militant forces in the remote Mount Chaambi region, along the Algerian border. The ceremony on Friday was for two men killed on Thursday by an armed group in the Beja region, 70km (40 miles) west of the capital Tunis. Many of the demonstrators carried placards demanding laws to protect the police. "We will not accept the presence of politicians," shouted one of the protesters, the AFP news agency reports. Parliamentary speaker Mustapha Ben Jaafar was also reported to have been driven away by the crowd. However, Interior Minister Lotfi Ben Jeddou did manage to make a brief speech. Correspondents say he is relatively new in office and seen as being tough on Islamist militants. He told the crowd: "We are all against terrorism. This is a war, and we will not give up." Our correspondent says there is considerable public anger over the killing of the police officers, which follows the deaths of eight soldiers in July. In December, President Marzouki and Mr Ben Jaafar were forced to flee from a ceremony in the central town of Sidi Bouzid to mark the two-year anniversary of the revolution. On that occasion, protesters heckled them and pelted them with stones, saying the government had failed to improve their living conditions. A coalition led by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party was elected in 2011, after street protests toppled long-time leader Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali - the first leader ousted during the "Arab Spring". Some government critics accuse it of being soft on hardline Islamist forces - charges it strongly denies. </body>

      <body>Ugandan officials have seized some two tonnes (4,600lb) of ivory - one of the country's biggest such hauls for many years. The Uganda Wildlife Association (UWA) has said the 832 pieces of ivory could be worth up to $6.7m but other estimates put the value lower. Experts say some of the ivory is believed to have come from elephants poached outside Uganda. There is a huge demand for African ivory in Asia for use in ornaments. The ivory was apparently heading for the Kenyan port of Mombasa. Some of the tusks had been broken up and covered with plastic bottles in crates labelled as material to be recycled. The UWA told the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga that Uganda is increasingly being used as a transit country by poachers who kill elephants in states such as South Sudan or the Democratic Republic of Congo. Uganda is believed to have about 5,000 elephants and this haul would represent the tusks from about 400 animals. Last week, some four tonnes of ivory was found in Mombasa after coming from Uganda. According to the UWA, the rate of elephant poaching is relatively low in Uganda, with an estimated 20 elephants killed for their ivory across the country in 2010. After a sharp fall in the number of elephants in Africa, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) banned the trade in ivory in 1989 But in recent years poaching has increased across sub-Saharan Africa with criminal gangs slaughtering elephants for ivory markets in Asia. </body>

      <description>Hillary Clinton reveals details about two unprecedented incidents that threatened US-China ties in 2012 - Wang Lijun and Chen Guangcheng.</description>

      <body>Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has revealed details about two unprecedented incidents that threatened US-China ties in 2012. Speaking in London, Mrs Clinton called the flight of Wang Lijun, police chief to politician Bo Xilai, to the US consulate "a dangerous situation". She also discussed the diplomatic manoeuvres behind securing dissident Chen Guangcheng's passage to the US. Mrs Clinton described the crisis over the blind lawyer as "touch-and-go". The former top diplomat made her comments at Chatham House, a think-tank in London, on 11 October. Wang Lijun was formerly police chief to the now-disgraced ex-Chongqing Communist Party boss, Bo Xilai. Wang fled to the US consulate in Chengdu in February 2012, where he made allegations about the role of Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, in the death of British businessman Neil Heywood. When Wang Lijun showed up at the US consulate, "he did not fit any of the categories for the United States giving him asylum," said Mrs Clinton, according to a transcript. "He had a record of corruption, of thuggishness, brutality. He was an enforcer for Bo Xilai." The consulate was quickly surrounded by police officers loyal to Bo, Mrs Clinton said. "So it was becoming a very dangerous situation." However, Wang "kept saying that he wanted to get the truth to Beijing," Mrs Clinton said. "So we said: We can arrange that. So indeed that's what we did." "We were very discreet about it and did not try to embarrass anybody involved in it, but tried to handle it in a very professional manner, which I think we accomplished." Bo's wife was subsequently convicted of Mr Heywood's murder, and Bo was recently convicted of bribery, corruption and abuse of power. Wang was also jailed for 15 years for his involvement. Mrs Clinton also said she made the call to shelter blind dissident Chen Guangcheng in the US embassy in Beijing. Mr Chen, a campaigner against forced abortions, escaped house arrest in April 2012, a week before annual high profile US-China talks in Beijing. "I get called late, late one night about Chen," Mrs Clinton said. "Of course, we knew of his courageous history of dissident activity." "I was very well aware that this would be an issue in the relationship, but I also believed that this was an example of American values in practice." "So lots of back and forth, as you can imagine, and then I finally just made the call. I said: We're going to send our people out to go pick him up." She described what followed as "a very touch-and-go situation". Mr Chen initially opted to stay in China, but then said he wanted to leave the US after learning about threats made to his family - hours after leaving his refuge at the embassy. Ms Clinton said: "I had to go to State Councillor Dai Bingguo and I had to say: This is in your interests and it's in our interests, and there's got to be a way we can work this out." "His first response was: We never want to talk about this man again with anybody. We can't go back into negotiations." Ms Clinton added that she agreed to requests not to discuss Chen Guangcheng in her meetings with then-leaders Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao. "They said: Please don't mention this to them, we will try to work this out. So I didn't, and we had very formal, very predictable kinds of meetings," she said. Mr Chen was eventually allowed to travel to the US to study. Ms Clinton also said that building relations and understanding with China was an important process. "I came to believe that the Chinese... believed that somewhere in Washington there is a master plan about what we intend to do to try to control their rise." "They have never understood the jazz-like quality of American government and democracy." </body>

      <body>Police in northern India have secured the site of an archaeological dig after hundreds of people gathered there amid reports it held buried treasure. The crowds gathered as media reports say that a Hindu seer dreamt 1,000 tonnes of gold was buried under the ruins of a 19th Century fort. Shobhan Sarkar said the gold belonged to King Rao Ram Baksh Singh. Archaeology officials say the dig is not linked to the dream, but a routine attempt to look for cultural artefacts. Government archaeologists began excavating the remains of an old fort in Daundia Khera village in Uttar Pradesh state on Friday morning. The police have been deployed in strength to keep away curious villagers and barricades have been set up to prevent onlookers from entering the excavation site. Geologists who have surveyed the site say there is a possibility that the site contains some metal. Mr Sarkar said the king appeared in his dream and told him to take care of the gold found under the ruins of his fort. Reports say the sage was not taken seriously at first, but this changed after the seer relayed his dream to an Indian government minister who visited him last month. Even before any excavations began, there were several claimants to any treasure found at that location. "If gold is really found there, we should get our share," Associated Press quoted one of the king's descendants, Navchandi Veer Pratap Singh, as saying. Uttar Pradesh state authorities, as well as local officials, also said they had a right to the wealth and that the "treasure trove should be used for the development of the state", AP reported. </body>

      <title>Protesters disrupt French schools</title>
      <description>Secondary schools in Paris and other French cities are again disrupted by pupils protesting at the removal of two foreign students from France.</description>

      <body>Schools in Paris and other French cities are being disrupted again by pupil protests over the removal of two foreign students from France. Protesters gathered on the French capital's Bastille square, traditional meeting-place of the left, as some demonstrators clashed with riot police. Divisions have appeared among the ruling Socialists over the affair. It has emerged that the father of a Roma schoolgirl at the centre of the row lied over his asylum claim. However, the anger in France has focused on the way Leonarda Dibrani, 15, was removed from a school bus to be expelled along with her family earlier this month. They had been living in the eastern region of Doubs for several years. While President Francois Hollande has remained silent, his partner, Valerie Trierweiler, spoke out on Friday to question the girl's treatment. Protesters are calling for the resignation of Interior Minister Manuel Valls, who has defended the authorities' tough line and takes a tough policy towards Roma immigrants in general. The minister has cut short an official visit to the French Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe in order to return to Paris, where findings of an inquiry into the handling of the affair are expected to be ready shortly. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault has said the family will be allowed to return if "any fault is found" with the expulsion order. There is also anger over the removal of Khatchik Kachatryan, a 19-year-old student in Paris who was expelled on Saturday to Armenia after reportedly being arrested for shoplifting, at which point police discovered he had entered France illegally. Police fired tear gas at some protesters in Paris but the demonstration in the Nation-Bastille area appeared to be passing off peacefully in the main. Pupils partially blocked entry to as many as 20 secondary schools in Paris while allowing other pupils to enter to attend classes, the pupils' union Fidl said. Outside one school in central Paris, the Lycee Charlemagne, wheelie bins were used to block the entrance. A banner read "Jotters not [ID] papers". One protester at the school, named as David, told Reuters: "We're a bit lost, we say our country is the country of human rights, a country which welcomes people and we still deport a 15-year-old girl and a 19-year-old student to a country... that they don't know and where they have no future." There appeared to be less protest activity in other French cities but some schools were affected in Marseille, Lyon and Rouen. Speaking on a visit to Angers, Ms Trierweiler said "certain boundaries cannot be crossed" and "the school gate is one of them". Education Minister Vincent Peillon told French radio that it was wrong for the authorities to have detained the girl while she was on a trip. "What is certain is that when one is in the setting of a class outing, and that was the case, you are part of school life... and you can't intervene during that time," he said. "That means schools are kind of a sanctuary." Opinion polls suggest Mr Valls is the most popular member of President Hollande's government with the wider public. His critics point to the fact that he himself was born in Spain. However, he was naturalised in France more than 20 years ago. Leonarda Dibrani and her family have been given a flat and a small allowance in the Kosovo city of Mitrovica, where they have been speaking to French journalists about the shock of being sent to a region where they are strangers, unable to speak Albanian. Resat Dibrani told media in Kosovo, where he and his family were expelled, that he had lied to the French authorities when he said his family was from the breakaway Serbian region. In fact, only he was born there while, according to him, his daughter Leonarda and other members of his family were born in Italy. "We lied to the authorities when we said we were from Kosovo," he told Reuters news agency. It emerged in France that the father was investigated by French authorities for allegedly beating his family. Little is known about the fate of Mr Kachatryan, though it was reported that he had been detained on his return to Armenia for evading military service. </body>

      <title>Norwegian Kenya attack suspect named</title>
      <description>A Norwegian man being investigated over the Westgate terror attacks is Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, the BBC's Newsnight programme learns.</description>

      <body>The man being investigated by Norwegian police over the attack on Kenya's Westgate shopping centre is Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, BBC Newsnight has learned. The 23-year-old Norwegian citizen of Somali origin is suspected of helping to plan and carry out the attack. BBC Newsnight has spoken to a relative of his in Norway who said he left the town of Larvik for Somalia in 2009. At least 67 people died in the attack in Nairobi, which the al-Qaeda linked group al-Shabab says it carried out. Last week Norway's intelligence agency, the PST, said it had sent officers to Kenya to verify reports that a Norwegian citizen had been involved in the assault on the shopping centre, which began on Saturday 21 September and lasted four days. It is unclear how many militants were involved. Police had initially estimated that there were 10-15 attackers inside the complex, but the CCTV footage which has so far been released by the Kenyan authorities shows just four men. Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow is believed to be one of those four, the BBC's Newsnight programme has learned from sources in Kenya and Norway. Forensic investigators are still combing through the rubble of Westgate - no bodies have yet been identified and it is not known whether the attackers are alive or dead. Dhuhulow was born in Somalia, but he and his family moved to Norway as refugees in 1999. One relative, who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity, said that Dhuhulow left for Somalia in 2009. He made infrequent, increasingly erratic, phone calls to the family, they said, the last one coming in the summer when he said that he was in trouble and wanted to return home. On being shown the CCTV footage of the Kenya attackers by Newsnight, Dhuhulow's relative said: "I don't know what I feel or think... If it is him, he must have been brainwashed." Reporting for Newsnight, Gabriel Gatehouse travelled to the coastal town of Larvik, 120 km (75 miles) south of Oslo, where Dhuhulow's family made their home. Morten Henriksen, one of the family's former neighbours, has not seen Dhuhulow for years. "He was pretty extreme, didn't like life in Norway… got into trouble, fights, his father was worried," Mr Henriksen said of Dhuhulow as a teenager. When shown the CCTV footage of the four Kenya attackers he said that the one dressed in a black shirt or jacket could be Dhuhulow. Stig Hansen, an expert on security and political Islam based in Norway, told Newsnight said that he was not surprised to learn that a Norwegian citizen was suspected of taking part in the attack. He said that an estimated 20-30 Norwegians had gone to Somalia to sign up as fighters for the Islamist militant group al-Shabab. "The biggest problem is the so-called 'Generation 1.5', those who weren't born in Norway, but came when they were quite young, falling between two cultures," he said. "[Al-Shabab] need people who are quite ignorant about Somalia. That is in their interest because that will give them a more internationalist agenda. And it might also make them more dangerous when they return back to their home countries," he added. There have been reports that a Kenyan al-Shabab leader whom US commandos targeted in a raid in Somalia on 5 October, but failed to capture, may have spent time in Norway. Norway's TV2 reported that Abdukadir Mohamed Abdukadir, also known as Ikrima, had travelled to Norway and applied for asylum in 2004 but left in 2008 before there was a decision on his application. Norwegian officials have not commented on the claims. The full report aired on Newsnight on BBC Two at 22:30 BST on Thursday 17 October and is available on BBC iPlayer (UK only) </body>

      <title>Syrian intelligence chief killed</title>
      <description>A senior Military Intelligence officer, who activists said was close to President Bashar al-Assad, has been killed in eastern Syria.</description>

      <body>A senior Military Intelligence officer has been killed in eastern Syria, state media and activists say. State television reported on Thursday that Gen Jamaa Jamaa had died while "carrying out his national duties" and "pursuing terrorists" in Deir al-Zour. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said he was shot by a sniper during clashes between government and rebel forces in the city's Rashdiya district. Gen Jamaa was close to President Bashar al-Assad, the UK-based group added. He was commander of Syrian Military Intelligence's headquarters in Lebanon's capital, Beirut, when former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was assassinated there in 2005. Gen Jamaa was questioned as part of a UN inquiry into the killing after the Syrian withdrawal. Damascus has always denied any involvement, although five members of the allied Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah have been indicted. In 2006, the US Treasury named Gen Jamaa as a Specially Designated National, saying he had "significantly contributed to the Syrian government's military and security presence in Lebanon". Al-Arabiya TV reported that at the time of his death Gen Jamaa was head of Military Intelligence in Deir al-Zour province, and was one of the most powerful security officials in the country. The Aisha bin al-Sadiq Brigade said one of its fighters had shot him. The UK-based Syrian Observatory said he was killed during clashes between troops and members of the Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda-affiliated group, and Liwa al-Fatihun min Ard al-Sham. Al-Nusra fighters also executed 10 soldiers captured during the fighting, it added. There were reportedly air strikes and fierce clashes overnight in several districts of Deir al-Zour after state television reported Gen Jamaa's death. Another 20 soldiers and seven rebels died on Friday during an assault on air-defence base near the towns of Hujaira and Obaida, in the northern province of Aleppo, according to the Syrian Observatory. At least 19 people, including 10 children, were killed when shells hit a vehicle and a residential building in Tal Aran, also in Aleppo province, on Friday, the group added. The town is not far from the al-Safira military complex, which is believed to house a major chemical weapons facility. </body>

      <title>Egypt denies holding Syrian refugees</title>
      <description>Egypt has described as inaccurate an Amnesty International report that accuses it of unlawfully detaining hundreds of Syrian refugees.</description>

      <body>Egypt's foreign ministry has described as inaccurate a report that accuses the Egyptian authorities of unlawfully detaining hundreds of Syrian refugees. Amnesty International said scores of children were being held, often without their parents, while some refugees had been detained at police stations. A foreign ministry spokesman said the Syrians were treated as "brothers". There were some cases of people who had taken part in armed protests and these were dealt with lawfully, he added. While Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi was in power, Syrian refugees told Amnesty that they felt safe and protected in Egypt. However, after he was deposed by the military in July, some public figures and parts of the mainstream media started accusing Syrians of being supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and taking part in pro-Morsi demonstrations that demanded his reinstatement. Rather than helping vulnerable Syrian refugees, the Egyptian authorities began detaining hundreds of them, including children, Amnesty alleged. Many were being held in deplorable conditions in overcrowded police stations, the report said. Refugees were offered a choice between prolonged detention and agreeing to be deported, it added. But Egyptian foreign ministry spokesman Badr Abdul Atti said the report "failed to reflect the real conditions of Syrians on the ground in Egypt". He said there was no "official policy" to deport Syrians against their will, and that the majority of the Syrians in the country "live in peace". "There are some limited individual cases of Syrians who took part in armed demonstrations or acts of violence, and these were individual cases that have been dealt with in accordance to the law." Up to 300,000 were being treated decently "as Arab brothers", receiving the same healthcare and education as Egyptians, Mr Abdul Atti added. "It's a matter of principle for Egypt to support the Syrian people in their plight and to support the Syrian revolution," he stated. Mr Abdul Atti said the new requirement for Syrians to have visas to enter Egypt was "an exceptional measure linked to the security situation in Egypt" and would later be reviewed. The UN refugee agency says 123,000 Syrians have registered with it in Egypt. More than 2.1 million people have abroad since the uprising in Syria began in 2011. </body>

      <title>Death home saw 'institutional abuse'</title>
      <description>Institutionalised abuse took place at Orchid View, the Crawley care home that saw 19 unexplained deaths, a coroner says.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-24579496</url>

      <body>A care home where 19 residents died was riddled with "institutionalised abuse", a coroner has said. Penelope Schofield has ruled neglect contributed to five of the deaths, at Orchid View in Copthorne, near Crawley. The West Sussex coroner said the home, then run by Southern Cross, was "mismanaged and understaffed". Ms Schofield has also criticised the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which gave the home a "good" rating in 2010, a year before it closed down. A serious case review has now begun into the elderly residents' deaths. At the final day of a five-week inquest into the deaths, which were all "unexplained", Mrs Schofield said the problems at the home were from the top down and started at an early stage, but nobody did anything to address them. Orchid View has since reopened under a new name and new management. Ms Schofield said it was "disgraceful" Southern Cross was allowed to run the home in the way it was, for about two years. Referring to the CQC's rating of the home, she said: "I question how this could be the case and I question whether the inspection that did take place was fit for purpose. "It's a heartbreaking case. We all have parents who will probably need care in the latter part of their lives." Andrea Sutcliffe, the CQC's chief inspector of adult social care, said she had ordered a "root-and-branch review" of the organisation's actions in relation to Orchid View. While summing up, Ms Schofield said she had found that medical documents for resident Jean Halfpenny, 77, were falsified and that she was given too much of the blood-thinning drug warfarin. Home manager Meera Reed had earlier denied ordering staff to shred documents and filling in new forms to cover up the overdose. Continuing, the coroner said that another resident was found naked and in pain with his catheter twisted, while a family member found staff eating toast and drinking tea with their feet up. Whistleblower Lisa Martin, who first informed police of problems at Orchid View, said she felt she had no choice but to come forward. Speaking outside the inquest, she said: "I had witnessed too much poor management and care to vulnerable adults. "I couldn't live with the knowledge any longer and felt I had no choice but to tell the police." She said she knew she had done the right thing morally, but said she had not worked for two years and the case had had a huge impact on her life. Speaking of her former colleagues, she said: "They shouldn't be allowed to work in the industry." During the inquest, the coroner also said it was a cause for concern that many people who worked at Orchid View were still working in the industry. Ms Martin said when Mrs Halfpenny had to be admitted to hospital, Ms Reed looked at her forms and said: "We can't send her to hospital with those. They will shut us down." She said other forms were filled out and she was asked not to disclose the shredding of the original documents to anyone. She added that the final straw came when she was told by a nurse they had found 28 drug errors from just one night shift. She called the police who arrived the next day. Ms Schofield said that all 19 residents whose deaths were unexplained had suffered "sub-optimal" care. She said they had all died of natural causes but the deaths of 86-year-old Enid Trodden, 85-year-olds Wilfred Gardner and John Holmes, and 77-year-olds Margaret Tucker and Jean Halfpenny "had been attributed to by neglect". After the hearing, Mrs Halfpenny's daughter, Linzi Collings, said the horrific details that had emerged were beyond comprehension. She said: "How the corporate failings of Southern Cross could create these events and how such terrible standards could go unnoticed by the authorities for so long has left us baffled." She said her mother deserved to be treated with dignity and compassion, but Orchid View failed to provide her with even basic care, despite being paid a significant amount of money. Lawyers for some families have called for a public inquiry to be set up, but the coroner said she would await the outcome of the serious case review first. Ian Christian, of Irwin Mitchell solicitors, which represented seven families, said the situation at Orchid View raised questions about the quality of care provided across the industry. He said before Southern Cross closed, it had owned 752 care homes. "The evidence revealed in this inquest is deeply concerning as it shows signs of profits being put before the well-being of residents," he said. Amanda Rogers, director of adult services for West Sussex County Council, said the inquest showed a shocking example of poor care, but such examples were "isolated" and the public should "remain confident" about the levels of care in West Sussex. The CQC's Ms Sutcliffe said she was shocked at the descriptions of care at Orchid View in 2010 and 2011. She said it was "completely unacceptable" and lessons needed to be learned. She added that she would "personally oversee a root-and-branch review of our actions". Ms Sutcliffe said she had already outlined changes to how care homes would inspected, monitored and regulated in the future. </body>

      <title>SNP pledges energy bill cut post Yes</title>
      <description>Scotland's deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon unveils plans to cut energy bills by 5% a year in an independent Scotland.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-24568887</url>

      <body>Scotland's deputy first minister has unveiled plans to cut energy bills by about 5% a year if the country votes for independence. Nicola Sturgeon told the SNP's conference in Perth the reduction of about £70 would be achieved by removing a number of "green" charges. She believed the measure would not be a short-term fix, but a "real and lasting cut". People in Scotland vote in an independence referendum next year. On Thursday, 18 September, 2014, they will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?" Ms Sturgeon explained that two schemes worth up to half of the green costs imposed on energy companies would be removed from the bills of consumers. The minister told the party's annual gathering: "Right now, the Scottish government invests around £80m a year on energy efficiency schemes to help meet our climate change targets and lower the costs of energy bills. "A further £120m comes from a scheme designed in Westminster, operated through energy companies and paid for by a levy on your gas and electricity bills. "It is a disjointed approach, it doesn't take account of Scottish priorities and it's not as efficient as it could be." Ms Sturgeon went on to announce that an SNP government in an independent Scotland would remove the energy saving measures and the warm home discount from energy bills. She said the current system would be replaced by a more joined-up approach with funding for fuel poverty schemes - worth up to £200m per year - coming directly from government. Ms Sturgeon added: "Independence will allow us to tackle fuel poverty much more directly, delivering Scottish solutions to Scottish problems, and ensuring that energy companies always behave in a socially responsible way to protect vulnerable customers." She insisted the energy schemes would be delivered more effectively and it would save hard-pressed consumers money. The SNP deputy leader told the conference: "We estimate that it will cut energy bills by around 5% - or £70 a year. "Not a short-term measure - but a real and lasting cut in Scottish energy bills." The minister went on to demand that the coalition government at Westminster ditch its spare room subsidy, which is described by critics as the ''bedroom tax''. But she said if it refused to act, the current Scottish government would allocate "up to £20m" for a second year to help those who have been affected. Ms Sturgeon also announced that the Holyrood administration would fund the Poverty Alliance to deliver a Living Wage Accreditation Scheme to "promote the living wage and increase the number of private companies that pay it". Turning to the issue of health, Ms Sturgeon said a UK-wide approach "would be the worst thing that could ever happen to the Scottish NHS". She added: "Westminster privatisation of the NHS is not wanted in Scotland. "Scotland's national health service is staying in public hands." Ms Sturgeon went on to warn that Westminster MPs in all the UK parties were "itching to abolish the Barnett formula and cut Scotland's share of spending". She said: "So, I say this to everyone yet to make up their mind [on independence]. Consider carefully the arguments for a Yes vote. Subject them to scrutiny and ask the tough questions. "But do not ever let anyone pull the wool over your eyes about the consequences of a No vote. "They are clear and they are real. Scotland's social security system will be dismantled; Scotland's public services and universal benefits will be under threat and Scotland's budget will be cut. "The risks of a No vote are real." Ms Sturgeon promised that the Scottish government's White Paper on independence, which is due to be published next month, would "answer all your questions". She added: "The White Paper will be Scotland's detailed guide to independence. "It will make the positive case. It will explain the process by which we will become independent and describe how our newly independent country will work. "It will set out the gains of independence for you, your family and for your community." Towards the end of her speech, Ms Sturgeon said: "The vote in 2014 is not a vote for or against the SNP. "It is a vote for or against the power to take decisions in Scotland." She insisted that an SNP government after independence would bring the mail service back into public ownership; reverse welfare reforms; protect state pensions and get rid of Trident nuclear weapons. </body>

      <description>Google shares top $1,000 for the first time after the company reported better-than-expected earnings.</description>

      <body>Google shares have topped $1,000 (£617) for the first time after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. The company posted a 36% jump in net profits to $2.97bn for the July-to-September period. Shares in the giant online search and ads company rose more than 13% to $1,006, and are now up 41% since the start of 2013. Google's revenues also beat forecasts with a 12% rise year-on-year. "We are closing in on our goal of a beautiful, simple, and intuitive experience regardless of your device," Google's chief Larry Page said in a conference call with analysts. The strong earnings report also helped other online companies, with Facebook shares adding 4.4% to a new high of more than $55. Amazon rose 3.4%. At $1,000 a share, Google's market value is about $334bn, which is still well below Apple's $461bn. Google was floated in August 2004 at $85 a share, giving the company a market value at the time of $23bn. The company reported its quarterly earnings on Thursday after US markets had closed. Google said that paid-for clicks increased by a quarter during the July-to-September period, from a year earlier, the highest rate of growth in the past year. This offset an 8% fall in average cost-per-click, the price advertisers pay Google when consumers click on their ads. "We view solid paid clicks growth to be a good indicator of demand, driven by the continued shift to mobile," JP Morgan analysts said in a note. Several brokers have raised their share price target for Google on the back of the company's new initiatives to attract advertisers. In February, the company launched a service to help advertisers market through a mix of smartphones, tablets and desktop computers. And analysts believe there is still significant potential to generate revenues from its video-streaming website YouTube. YouTube-branded video-ads surged more than 75% in the quarter from a year earlier, with 40% of traffic now coming from mobile devices. "We estimate that Google's key YouTube asset generated approximately $4bn in revenue in 2012, positioning Google extremely well for the strong growth in video advertising," RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. Analysts at Jefferies said Google is best positioned to benefit from mobile devices with one billion activations of its Android system. Google sells applications and content through its Google Play store. </body>

      <title>Toyota to recall 885,000 vehicles</title>
      <description>Toyota is recalling 885,000 vehicles, mainly in North America, to fix a problem that could lead to airbags being disabled or inadvertently deploying.</description>

      <body>Toyota is recalling 885,000 vehicles to fix a problem that could cause a water leak from the air conditioning unit. It said water could leak into the airbag control module, causing a short circuit and triggering a warning light. In some cases airbags "could become disabled or could inadvertently deploy" and in limited cases the power steering function could be disabled, it added. The models affected by the recall are the Camry, Camry Hybrid, Avalon, Avalon Hybrid, and Venza made in 2012-13. Some 847,000 cars will be recalled in North America, while the rest will be in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. A spokeswoman for Toyota told the BBC that it had received reports of two minor injuries due to the issue, but there had been no reports of any vehicles crashing. This is the third major recall that Toyota has issued in recent weeks. Last month, the company called back more than 780,000 vehicles in the US to address a suspension defect in its RAV4 and Lexus HS 250h models, after fears that an initial recall last year did not fix the problem. In September, it recalled 615,000 Sienna minivans in the US to fix a lever problem that could cause vehicles to shift out of park mode "without the driver depressing the brake pedal". Toyota said at the time that it was aware of 24 "minor accidents" due to the issue. In recent weeks more than 2.2 million vehicles have been recalled. Analysts said the recalls could have an impact on its reputation with the customers. "Repeated recalls definitely dent the image of any carmaker," Vivek Vaidya, an auto analyst with consulting firm Frost and Sullivan told the BBC. "If you have one big recall, it is still manageable. But if (a company) calls back different vehicle models at different times for unrelated issues, customers tend to have a re-think about your quality assurance. "And if the problem involves airbag deployment - it becomes a serious issue," he added. The latest move takes the total number of cars recalled by Toyota this year to six million vehicles. </body>

      <title>US government heads back to work</title>
      <description>US government employees are back at work after President Obama signed a law ending a government shutdown and raising the US debt limit.</description>

      <body>Hundreds of thousands of US government employees are back at work after President Barack Obama signed a law ending a 16-day government shutdown and extending the US debt limit. The cross-party deal came hours before the US government risked running out of money to pay its bills. "There are no winners," Mr Obama said, adding the US would "bounce back". The deal followed 16 days of partial government shutdown, which began when Congress failed to agree on a budget. Congress voted through the deal less hours before a deadline to raise the $16.7tn (£10.5tn) debt limit. The measure approved in Washington funds the government to 15 January, and extends the US Treasury's borrowing authority until 7 February. The deal does not resolve the budgetary issues that fiercely divide Republicans and Democrats. Instead, it establishes a cross-party committee of legislators tasked with crafting a long-term budget deal and reporting back to Congress by mid-December. A faction of Republicans in the hardline Tea Party movement had pushed for the confrontation as a way to gut Mr Obama's healthcare reform. However, Mr Obama and the Democrats refused to negotiate, and the law commonly known as Obamacare escaped relatively unscathed. On Thursday, Mr Obama thanked congressional leaders for their help ending the government shutdown and raising the debt limit, but said both had "inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy". "Nothing has done more to undermine our economy the last three years than the kind of tactics that create these kinds of manufactured crises," he said. Mr Obama said politicians had to stop listening to "talking heads" and activists "who profit from conflict" and instead focus on growing the economy and creating a responsible budget. "The American people are completely fed up with Washington," he said. "How business is done in this town has to change." Mr Obama called the political crises "a spectacle" which had hurt America's credibility in the world. And to the conservative Republicans who pushed the showdown as a way to extract policy concessions, he said: "Go out there and win an election." Politicians, bankers and economists had warned of global economic calamity unless an agreement to raise the US government's borrowing limit were reached. IMF head Christine Lagarde's positive response to the news was tempered by a call for further action. "It will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner," she said in a statement. Economists have estimated the shutdown cost the US economy billions of dollars. The shutdown affected Americans and visitors to the US in countless ways: most national parks were closed, medical research ground to a halt, and ordinary paperwork went unfinished, delaying visa applications, business permits and safety inspections. Hundreds of thousands of employees were put on leave without pay during the shutdown, with many forced to delay purchases or even payment of routine bills. A few days into the shutdown Congress passed a law ensuring they would receive back pay. Before dawn on Thursday, the US Office of Personnel Management, which manages the federal workforce, announced in a terse statement on its website that government workers should return to work as regularly scheduled. A senior manager at the Department of the Interior, which oversees the national parks system and other public land, reminded employees to disable "out of office" email messages, change voicemail prompts, and "check on any refrigerators and throw out any perished food". "We appreciate your sacrifices through these difficult times and we understand that the lapse in government activities has imposed hardships on you, your families, and the people we serve," Rhea Suh, assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, wrote. Federal workers returning to the downtown Washington DC office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were greeted by Vice-President Joe Biden and a welcome note from their boss, agency head Gina McCarthy. A security officer at the building said the shutdown had been "depressing" and had made her realise how much she enjoyed her job. "I enjoy checking in 500 people every day," said Ettereteen Welch. Spurred on by hardline conservatives, congressional Republicans forced the stand-off by linking budget measures to healthcare reform. Despite reluctant support from the House Republican leadership for the bill approved on Wednesday, most of the party's lawmakers in the House voted against it. Republican Congressman Mo Brooks told the Associated Press news agency the law that ended the shutdown merely delayed the fight. "We need to get to the underlying cause of the problem, which is our out-of-control spending and deficits," he said, "and fix it before it's too late and we go down the toilet to bankruptcy. Because that's where America is headed." </body>

      <title>Hodgson joke a compliment - Townsend</title>
      <description>England winger Andros Townsend describes the joke Roy Hodgson told that prompted a race row as a "compliment".</description>

      <body>Andros Townsend has described Roy Hodgson's comment that prompted a race row as a "compliment". England boss Hodgson was criticised for referring to a joke about a monkey and an astronaut at half-time in Tuesday's World Cup qualifier against Poland. Hodgson was trying to encourage right-back Chris Smalling to pass to Townsend, 22, more often. "The manager just told the players to give the ball to me so that's a compliment," said the Tottenham winger. "Everyone should be focusing on England qualifying for Brazil - not on negative silly news." The joke, the exact wording of which is still unclear, revolves around an astronaut and a monkey on a space mission. The monkey performs all the tasks requested by mission control, with the punchline being that the astronaut's only role is to feed the monkey. It came during Townsend's second game for England, after he had scored on his debut in the 4-1 win over Montenegro. "It's a dream come true to play for your country," said Townsend, who was speaking to BBC Sport news correspondent Natalie Pirks at a Spurs event to highlight breast cancer awareness.  "I had the perfect debut really, scoring a goal and getting man of the match, but I couldn't let it get to me or get big-headed as we had to concentrate on the next game. "It's only now after the games are done that I've realised how big it was for the country." Hodgson said on Friday that he and the players were angry that the race row had overshadowed England's achievement in qualifying for the World Cup in Brazil next year. "Joy is short-lived in this job," he told the Daily Mail.  "The players are as angry about this as I am. "We have just had a successful period and, although I wouldn't suggest we intend to rest on our laurels, I think we have earned the right to enjoy the fruits of our labours. Instead we get this." Former Southampton and England forward Matthew Le Tissier says he is disturbed that there is somebody in the dressing room that Hodgson cannot trust. "That's not a great thing to have," Le Tissier told BBC Sport. "If the player is offended then pull Roy to one side and be a man about it. Roy is the type of guy who will have gone 'I didn't really mean any offence and I apologise'. "That would have been the end of the matter." Anti-racism campaigners Kick It Out had called for the Football Association to investigate the comments, but it considered the matter closed on Thursday after the governing body released a statement in support of Hodgson. "Roy Hodgson is a man of the highest integrity, an honourable man who is doing a great job with the England team," said FA chairman Greg Dyke. "He has fully explained to us what he said and the point he was making to the players in the dressing room at half-time on Tuesday night. He has also explained the context in which he made his remarks." However, another campaign group has sent a formal complaint to the FA in which it calls for an independent investigation into the issue. In the four-page complaint, Race for Sport, an off-shoot of the Society for Black Lawyers, says the decision to consider the matter closed is "unacceptable". It also demands "cultural intelligence" training for Hodgson and all football managers. England striker Wayne Rooney showed his support for 66-year-old Hodgson on Twitter   and via his personal website.  "To try and pin some form of label on him is absolutely ridiculous," he said. "Roy spoke to Andros straight away and he took no offence whatsoever. Hopefully that's now the end of the matter." </body>

      <body>New Zealand captain Richie McCaw will miss Saturday's Bledisloe Cup game against Australia with a calf injury. Both 32-year-old flanker McCaw and winger Cory Jane, 30, picked up injuries in training. Sam Cane replaces McCaw on the open-side flank and Charles Piutau will start on the right wing, with Steven Luatua added to the replacements. "We could have played him but the risk and reward wasn't worth it," said All Blacks coach Steve Hansen. McCaw has been troubled by a knee problem suffered earlier in the Rugby Championship and Hansen is not prepared to risk his skipper before the end-of-year tour which includes Tests against France, England and Ireland. "We have got to the situation now where it's business as usual. If someone gets injured then the expectation is that everyone has been preparing to play anyway and people come in," added Hansen. "There is a lot of trust with each other." Jane had been rushed back for the game after only two appearances in New Zealand's provincial competition after sustaining knee ligament damage in pre-season training. The All Blacks have already clinched the Bledisloe Cup after two earlier victories over the Wallabies in the Rugby Championship. New Zealand: Israel Dagg; Charles Piutau, Ben Smith, Ma'a Nonu, Julian Savea; Aaron Cruden, Aaron Smith; Kieran Read (captain), Sam Cane, Liam Messam; Sam Whitelock, Jeremy Thrush; Charlie Faumuina, Keven Mealamu, Tony Woodcock. Replacements: Dane Coles, Wyatt Crockett, Ben Franks, Brodie Retallick, Steven Luatua, Tawera Kerr-Barlow, Beauden Barrett, Tom Taylor. Australia: Israel Folau, Adam Ashley-Cooper, Tevita Kuridrani, Matt Toomua, Peter Betham, Quade Cooper, Will Genia, Ben McCalman, Michael Hooper, Ben Mowen, James Horwill (captain), Rob Simmons, Ben Alexander, Stephen Moore, James Slipper.

      <body>Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho believes John Terry may have been too hasty by announcing his England retirement. The 32-year-old defender won 78 caps but quit in September 2012 after a racism row involving Anton Ferdinand. Mourinho believes his captain could still do a job for his country after "recovering his self-esteem". "If I was a football player I would wait for the national team to say we don't need you any more," said Mourinho. "That is just my personal feeling. For sure he has reasons that push him for that decision." Terry was cleared at Westminster Magistrates' Court of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand during a Premier League game in October 2011, but said his position in the national team became "untenable" when the Football Association pursued charges against him. Terry's final appearance for the Three Lions was the 5-0 World Cup qualifying win away to Moldova 13 months ago. He made just 11 Premier League starts last season but has been involved in all seven top-flight games since Mourinho returned to Stamford Bridge in the summer. "He is recovering his self-esteem, recovering the feeling of being an important player for the team which he lost," Mourinho added. "The reasons that pushed him to international retirement are out of my control." England manager Roy Hodgson was asked this week whether Terry or Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand could force their way back into his World Cup plans. "I like John Terry, he did a fantastic job for me at the Euros," Hodgson told BBC Radio 5 live. "But it's not the moment to start resurrecting that." </body>

      <title>Philomena 'to fight R rating' in US</title>
      <description>Film producer Harvey Weinstein is to appeal against a decision by US film censors to give Philomena an R rating, according to reports.</description>

      <body>Film producer Harvey Weinstein is to appeal against a decision by US film censors to give his studio's latest film an R rating, according to reports. Philomena received the rating from the Classification and Ratings Administration for two instances of bad language. But the Weinstein Company will now officially appeal against the rating, The Hollywood Reporter said. The British Stephen Frears drama stars Dame Judi Dench and Steve Coogan. The film is based on the 2009 investigative book by BBC correspondent Martin Sixsmith about Irish-Catholic woman Philomena Lee's search for her son after being forced to put him up for adoption decades earlier. The Weinstein Company plans to release the film in the US over the Thanksgiving period next month, however it has argued the R rating will affect the number of moviegoers who could potentially watch it. The restricted R rating means people under the age of 17 may only see the film if they are accompanied by a parent or guardian. In the UK, it has been given a 12A rating by the British Board of Film Classification, where children younger than 12 years of age must be accompanied by an adult. Weinstein's studio previously became embroiled in a row with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) in 2012 over the documentary Bully over the use of bad language in the film. It opened in Los Angeles and New York without a rating, after the Weinstein Company chose to ignore the MPAA's original R rating. The studio eventually agreed to remove the language and an edited version of the film received a PG-13 rating. </body>

      <title>Tennant's Richard II rules at RSC</title>
      <description>Early reviews note David Tennant's "mesmerising" performance and "Christ-like" hair in Richard II in Stratford-upon-Avon.</description>

      <body>David Tennant's latest role sees him transformed into a king with flowing locks in the Royal Shakespeare Company's (RSC) Richard II. Early reviews have noted Tennant's "mesmerising" performance and "Christ-like" hair. Richard II is the former Doctor Who star's first RSC role since his acclaimed Hamlet five years ago. Tennant and the cast won enthusiastic applause on Thursday's opening night in Stratford-upon-Avon. The production transfers to the Barbican in London in December. It reunites Tennant with Hamlet director Gregory Doran, who is now in charge at the RSC. Starting with Richard II, Doran intends to stage each one of Shakespeare's plays once over the next six years up to 2019. Written almost entirely in verse, Richard II is a story of power and plotting in which the king's weakness and vanity threatens to drag his people into a civil war. In the cast alongside Tennant are Michael Pennington as John of Gaunt, Nigel Lindsay as Henry Bolingbroke, Oliver Ford Davies as the Duke of York and Jane Lapotaire as the Duchess of Gloucester. The play opens with a funeral lament sung live by a small choir, after which Tennant's smooth-chinned, long-haired Richard arrives in a flowing white robe, in sharp contrast to those around him in chain-mail or mourning black. In another scene he preens his rock-star locks in a mirror. "His hair takes some getting used to," notes The Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish. "Great gingery-brown extensions trail girlishly downwards. Long, magisterial, quasi-medieval robes add to the effeminate impression. "With his startled eyes and concentrated frown, Tennant is frail, pale and consistently interesting but the nervous energy he excels in is confined to quarters early on." Tennant gives a "mesmerising performance that grows in power as Richard's authority declines," according to Michael Billington in The Guardian. "The packed houses for this production's run in both Stratford and at the Barbican may have much to do with Tennant's star presence. But this is the strongest company the RSC has fielded in years." The Independent's Paul Taylor called it "another palpable hit for the Tennant/Doran collaboration". Recent star-name portrayals of Richard II include Eddie Redmayne at the Donmar Warehouse in 2011 and Ben Whishaw's Bafta-winning TV performance in the BBC's The Hollow Crown last year. Tennant told The Independent recently Richard II was a play he had loved since drama school when he saw a production with Sir Derek Jacobi. "It's quite unknowable," he said. "There are no heroes and villains in it, just people trying their best and not managing to get on with their lives." Tennant's association with the RSC goes back to 1996 when, aged 25, he played Touchstone in As You Like It. His other RSC appearances include Romeo and Juliet, The Comedy of Errors, Love's Labour's Lost and The Rivals. By the time he played the Prince of Denmark in Doran's modern-dress Hamlet in 2008, Tennant was a household name because of his lead role in Doctor Who. Tennant's last Shakespearean stage role was Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing in the West End in 2011, alongside his former Tardis companion Catherine Tate as Beatrice. He will be appearing alongside Matt Smith in the Doctor Who 50th anniversary story, The Day of the Doctor, on BBC One on 23 November. Richard II is at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until to 16 November and at the Barbican Theatre, London, from 9 December to 25 January. It will be broadcast live on 13 November to cinemas across the UK. </body>

      <title>McCartney plays surprise London gig</title>
      <description>Sir Paul McCartney delivers an impromptu gig in Covent Garden during the lunchtime rush.</description>

      <body>Sir Paul McCartney has given an impromptu gig in Covent Garden during the lunchtime rush. "Good afternoon," he told that assembled crowd of more than 2,000 fans. "Welcome to Covent Garden." "We're just going to do some songs from our new album so get your phones out... As if they weren't already," he added. The 71-year-old sang four songs from his latest album, New, from a truck parked on the piazza. It follows a similar stunt in New York last week. The London gig began at 1330 BST, about an hour after Sir Paul announced it on Twitter. "I'm getting ready to pop up in Covent Garden," the former Beatle tweeted. "Oh baby!" "Alright! Busking!" he joked after taking to the stage, watched by his daughter, Stella. "This is a change from the '60s because we would just have been coming in from the clubs right now." The singer opened with his current single, also called New, and closed with the same song approximately 20 minutes later, telling the audience: "Thank you very much. OK now, back to work!" "It was very exciting," Sir Paul told the BBC afterwards. "It felt little bit like I was in a dream - sort of a little bit spacey." The gig was an unexpected bonus for many tourists. "We were actually just looking around Covent Garden and we had this big surprise," said Flavia, a visitor from Paraguay. "I'm so happy, I can't believe!" She wasn't concerned by the abbreviated set, saying: "Even five minutes would be OK. Any time seeing him would be OK". Covent Garden employee Harel, 37, said he was "disappointed, but not surprised," Sir Paul only played five songs. While Craig Williams, who "legged it" to the show from work said, "even for that quick 10, 15 minutes, it's all worth it". "I honestly believe the Beatles' music saved my life," he added. "There were some dark times and he's just got a 'live life to the full' mentality, and I really clicked with that." The gig came exactly a week after Sir Paul was mobbed by fans, following a pop-up show in Times Square. He said the shows had been suggested by Stella. "She said, 'what you should do is just pop up somewhere and do a gig, and everyone will just get their phones out and they'll tweet it," the star told the BBC. "And I said, 'well that's not a bad idea - however, I've now got to go and do it!'" The hit-and-run concerts echo The Beatles' final live performance, a mile down the road from Covent Garden, on the roof of their record label, Apple. That show, in January 1969, brought traffic on Savile Row to a standstill and was eventually shut down by police who ordered the band's touring manager, Mal Evans, to turn off their amplifiers. "It started to filter up from Mal that the police were complaining," Sir Paul later recalled in The Beatles Anthology. "We said, 'We're not stopping'. He said, 'The police are going to arrest you'." The star remembered replying: "Good end to the film. Let them do it. Great! That's an end: Beatles Busted on Rooftop Gig!" McCartney's latest solo album was released on Monday. Early sales data suggests the record, which was produced by Mark Ronson (Amy Winehouse) and Paul Epworth (Adele), amongst others, is likely to chart at number three this weekend. He is also due to appear on BBC One's Graham Norton show on Friday night. </body>

      <title>London Mayor Boris Johnson sparks Chinese interest</title>
      <description>London's mayor wins over young admirers in China</description>

      <body>Boris Johnson rode a rental bicycle through crowds of admirers, travelled on the Beijing subway and made a speech which mentioned Harry Potter, Downton Abbey and James Bond. Along the way, the mayor of London managed to impress legions of young fans in China. Mr Johnson is wrapping up a six-day tour of China, which is happening at the same time as a trade mission headed by UK Chancellor George Osborne. Mr Johnson appears to be the more popular of the two politicians in China. The mayor's visit sparked thousands of comments on Weibo, China's version of Twitter. Few posted similar remarks about Mr Osborne, the mayor's Conservative Party rival. "[Mr Johnson] is a little bit special," says 19-year-old Song Yige, a second year law student at Peking University, who was in the audience to watch speeches by both men. "Politicians in China, they're like the chancellor. They're very calm and composed. But the mayor, he is very humorous. He is not distant like other politicians." Weibo users were slightly less reserved in their admiration of Mr Johnson. "I like your fluffy hair," one user wrote in English. "If you get bald someday in the future, will you put a wig? What colour will you like to choose?" "I simply want to know how to move to London without breaking any law? PS: I am poor!!! PPS: we all love you!! XOXO!" wrote another. The mayor's Beijing subway ride was particularly impressive, Ms Song says. "It's like some fresh air to China because we have never seen that before." Chinese leaders have been criticised in the past for their reluctance to use public transport, preferring instead to travel in chauffeur-driven cars. However, China's leaders are starting to use the same populist approaches as Boris Johnson, says Wang Zhanpeng, director of the British Studies Centre at the Beijing Foreign Studies University. "Chinese leaders weren't doing things like this as much in the past, but now there are some changes," Mr Wang says. "There are also more cases of leaders demonstrating their man-of-the-people approach and their personalities, although our leaders would do it more often on occasions like disaster relief." Sina, a top Chinese web portal, hosted a web page this week titled "Ask Boris Johnson", in which the mayor answered questions on his love of bicycling and expected upgrades to London's underground system. Most comments and questions asked Mr Johnson for his experience running a city like London, asking for tips on how he might improve vast Chinese cities like Beijing. "Our nation's officials, please learn from others," one Weibo user said. </body>

      <title>Where the penalty for miscarriage is jail</title>
      <description>A country where a woman may be jailed for losing a child</description>

      <body>El Salvador has one of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the world. A side-effect is that women who suffer miscarriages are sometimes suspected of inducing an abortion - and can even be jailed for murder. Glenda Xiomara Cruz was crippled by abdominal pain and heavy bleeding in the early hours of 30 October 2012. The 19-year-old from Puerto El Triunfo, eastern El Salvador, went to the nearest public hospital where doctors said she had lost her baby. It was the first she knew about the pregnancy as her menstrual cycle was unbroken, her weight practically unchanged, and a pregnancy test in May 2012 had been negative. Four days later she was charged with aggravated murder - intentionally murdering the 38-to-42 week foetus - at a court hearing she was too sick to attend. The hospital had reported her to the police for a suspected abortion. After two emergency operations and three weeks in hospital she was moved to Ilopango women's prison on the outskirts of the capital San Salvador. Then last month she was sentenced to 10 years in jail, the judge ruling that she should have saved the baby's life. Her lawyer, Dennis Munoz Estanley, says the legal system has an inbuilt "presumption of guilt" making it hard for women to prove their innocence. "She is yet another innocent victim of our unjust and discriminatory legal system which jails poor, young women who suffer obstetric complications for murder on the most flimsy evidence," he says. Xiomara's father describes the conviction as a "terrible injustice". He testified in court that his daughter had endured years of domestic violence at the hands of her partner. And yet the prosecution - which sought a 50-year jail term - relied heavily on this man's allegation that she had intentionally killed the foetus. Xiomara has not seen her four-year-old daughter since the miscarriage. El Salvador is one of five countries with a total ban on abortion, along with Nicaragua, Chile, Honduras and Dominican Republic. Since 1998, the law has allowed no exceptions - even if a woman is raped, her life is at risk or the foetus is severely deformed. More than 200 women were reported to the police between 2000 and 2011, of whom 129 were prosecuted and 49 convicted - 26 for murder (with sentences of 12 to 35 years) and 23 for abortion, according to research by Citizens' Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion. Seven more have been convicted since 2012. The study underlines that these women are overwhelmingly poor, unmarried and poorly educated - and they are usually denounced by public hospital staff. Not a single criminal case originated from the private health sector where thousands of abortions are believed to take place annually. Munoz has worked with 29 of the incarcerated women, helping secure the early release of eight. "Only one intentionally induced an abortion, the other 28 suffered natural obstetric complications but were jailed for murder without any direct evidence," he says. Last year when Maria Teresa Rivera suffered a miscarriage, she was sentenced to 40 years in jail for aggravated murder. Like Xiomara, Teresa, 28, had no pregnancy symptoms before sudden severe pain and bleeding, and was reported to police by the public hospital where she had sought emergency help. The scientific evidence was flimsy, according to Munoz who will soon lodge an appeal, and the prosecution relied heavily on a colleague of hers, who testified that Rivera had said she "might be" pregnant a full 11 months before the miscarriage. A textile factory worker, she was the family's only breadwinner and her eight-year-old son is now living in dire poverty with his grandmother. Cristina Quintanilla's story is different. On 24 October 2004, the 18-year-old from rural San Miguel was seven months pregnant with her second child, living with her mother in the capital to be near a hospital for the birth. Her boyfriend was working in the US, but the couple were excited buying baby clothes and saving food tokens. "Around midnight I felt an immense pain, I thought I was dying," Quintanilla says. "I was banging on the bathroom door to get my mum's attention when I felt the baby drop out. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital." Her mother called the police - a typical step for Salvadorans in an emergency, who took them to hospital. Quintanilla was given an anaesthetic, and interrogated when she came round. Then she was handcuffed to the hospital bed, charged with manslaughter and transferred to a police cell. The first judge dismissed the case, but the prosecution appealed, upgrading the charge to aggravated murder. Quintanilla was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in jail, where she was vilified as a child killer. Her son Daniel, then only four, spent four years living with his great-grandmother until Munoz succeeded in having the sentence reduced to three years. "The medical reports couldn't explain why the baby died, but the prosecutor made me out to be a criminal who could have saved my baby even though I had passed out in pain," she says. "I will never understand why they did this to me, I lost four years of my life and still don't know why I lost my baby." Morena Herrera from Citizens' Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion says these cases have had a chilling effect, with many pregnant poor women who suffer miscarriages or complications during pregnancy "too afraid to seek medical help". "I would be terrified to go a public hospital as there is no benefit of doubt given to young women, we are presumed guilty and jailed," says Bessy Ramirez, 27, from San Salvador. "We cannot even rely on health staff to put their prejudices aside and treat us confidentially." The strict abortion law has other serious human rights implications. Suicide was the most common cause of death in 2011 among 10-to-19-year-old girls, half of whom were pregnant, according to Health Ministry figures. It was also the third most common cause of maternal mortality. Earlier this year, the plight of lupus sufferer Beatriz, 22, attracted international condemnation after the Supreme Court refused to authorise an abortion, even though her life was at risk and the foetus too deformed to be viable. Beatriz's health deteriorated while the court deliberated for several months. She gave birth at 27 weeks. The baby died within hours. Individual members of the current FMLN government, particularly Health Minister Maria Isabel Rodriguez, criticised the abortion law during the controversy over Beatriz's case. But the government has made no attempt to repeal or relax the law since coming to power in 2009, as it remains popular with large parts of the conservative population, who revere the Church and pro-life religious groups such as Si a la Vida (Yes to Life). The Arena Party, which is strongly allied with the Church, is favourite to win next year's General Election. But Esther Major, Amnesty International's El Salvador expert, describes the country's abortion law as "cruel and discriminatory". "Women and girls end up in prison for being unwilling, or simply tragically unable, to carry the pregnancy to term," she says. "It makes seeking hospital treatment for complications during pregnancy, including a miscarriage, a dangerous lottery. "It cannot be in the interests of society to criminalise women and girls in this way." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>It is 50 years since John F Kennedy was assassinated. Where were you when you heard the news? Kennedy was sworn in as president in 1961. At 43 he was the country's youngest president and presented himself as a youthful figure for a new generation. On November 22, 1963, Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline were riding slowly in a motorcade through Dallas. At 12:30 the president was hit in the head and throat when three shots were fired at his open-topped car. He was pronounced dead shortly after arrival at Parkland Memorial Hospital. According to the Warren Commission established to investigate the assassination, a lone gunman - Lee Harvey Oswald - killed the president. There has been consistent speculation ever since that Kennedy's death was the result of a conspiracy. The news shocked the nation and the world. British-American journalist Alistair Cooke said he could not remember a time in the previous 30 years when people everywhere were "so quiet, so tired looking" and "so plainly the victims of a huge and bitter disappointment". In his Letter from America, Cooke recalled the promise of the youthful president, saying there was "the sense that we've been cheated… of the promise of what we had begun to call the age of Kennedy". Can you remember where you were when you heard the news? Have you got any photos from the day or did you ever meet the president? Wherever you are in the world, we want to hear your story.

      <title>Who is the true father of football in Brazil?</title>
      <description>Scot vying for title of man who took football to Brazil</description>

      <body>Leaning against the wall of a dusty warehouse in Bangu, a bland suburb in western Rio de Janeiro, a huge statue of a thickly-moustachioed footballer prepares to right a terrible historical wrong. With hair slicked back and an arm raised in a moment of goalscoring celebration, the four-and-a-half metre cast bronze effigy of Thomas Donohoe is due to be unveiled in the car park of the local shopping centre next month. In the early 1890s, the site housed a textile factory. Many of its workers were British immigrants, one of whom was Donohoe. This man, his sculptor argues, has been overlooked as the true father of Brazilian football and it's time the world knows about him. Ask almost any Brazilian football fan outside of Bangu who brought football to the country, though, and the answer you're likely to get is Charles Miller. Born in Sao Paulo in 1874, the son of a Scottish railway engineer and his Brazil-born wife, Miller was sent to school in Southampton at the age of 10. As a keen fan of the new sport, the headmaster of Banister Court School encouraged his pupils to play football. Miller proved a natural talent. Two years before he left school, he was already playing centre-forward for the first team. Later, he was picked for St Mary's FC (now Southampton) and played a few games for the Corinthians. Ten years after arriving in England, he returned to Brazil. In his luggage, famously, he packed two footballs and a book containing the 13 rules of association football. The match he organised, on 14 April 1895, between the workers of the Sao Paulo Railway and those of the Gas Company, all of whom were British, is widely considered the first football match to have been played in Brazil. A few years later, Miller established the country's first football league, cementing his status as the founder of the game in Brazil. But the residents of Bangu hope their new monument will convince football fans visiting Rio during next year's World Cup that it is really Donohoe who deserves the credit. "Thomas Donohoe was the first to bring a football to Brazil, eight months before Charles Miller," Clecio Regis, the statue's designer, tells me in his workshop. "They [Miller's supporters] accept this, but they say it was just for a kickabout. There's no way Donohoe would have settled for just a kickabout for eight months." The excitable 53-year old, a set designer, sculptor and owner of the second-largest Bangu Atletico Clube flag in existence, says the only reason Miller is credited with the discovery of the game is because he brought it to Sao Paulo. "People always forget about Bangu, but the first football in the country was the one brought here, by Thomas Donohoe," he adds. Thomas Donohoe was born in Busby, a mill town six miles outside Glasgow, in 1863. That same year, the world's first Football Association  was founded in London. Aged 10, Donohoe followed his father into the print works, working as a dyer. And about the same time as he joined the company, he set up its first football team. Few records of his sporting feats survive though, with the exception of a match report from 1887 praising his performance for Busby in an otherwise humiliating 5-2 defeat by Cartvale. Marriage, and children, followed. Struggling with a growing family and a meagre income, Donohoe sought opportunities outside Scotland. With British technical skills in demand as Latin America attempted to industrialise, he found a job as a master dyer at a new textile factory in Brazil. In May 1894, he set sail from Southampton to Rio, leaving behind his wife and two young sons. Little documentary evidence has been produced to flesh out the details of Donohoe's life in Latin America, particularly relating to his first football games. But Carlos Molinari, the official historian of Bangu Atletico Clube, is trying to put that right. Bangu consisted of little more than a single street and the textile factory when Donohoe arrived. According to Molinari, the Scot soon settled among the small British expat community in the village. Though happy with his job, and his new friends, he pined for his old hobby, finding Bangu's Sunday pastimes of cycling or music no match for football. He was horrified to discover there were no teams in the neighbourhood, no equipment to be bought in the shops, and no knowledge of the game whatsoever among the locals. So Donohoe wrote to his wife, Elizabeth, asking her to join him, and to bring a football, as well as their children. And shortly after her arrival, in September 1894, the first football match in Brazil took place in the field beside the textile factory. According to Molinari, it was a six-a-side match between British workers, and took place eight months before Charles Miller's game. Few supporters of Charles Miller's claim to be the father of Brazilian football dispute the accuracy of Molinari's work. They do, however, question Donohoe's significance. "Nobody is saying that no-one kicked a ball in Brazil before 1895," says John Mills, Miller's biographer. "But an organised game is an organised game." Of Miller's famed luggage, Mills argues the rulebook mattered more than the footballs. "The Sao Paulo Railway versus Gas Company match was the first recorded 11-a-side match using association football rules in Brazil." Mills shows me a letter written to a Brazilian sports journalist in 1937 by Hans Nobling, a German sportsman credited with helping to promote the game in the early stages of its development. "When I arrived in Sao Paulo, on 15 May 1897, football was unheard of in Sao Paulo and most likely throughout Brazil. […] To my mind, the honour of having brought to Sao Paulo the first ball for a game of football falls, without doubt, to Charles Miller," he wrote. Antonio Carlos Napoleao, a football historian I meet in the trophy-stuffed offices of the Confederacao Brasileira de Futebol, agrees with Mills. "I think this idea that there was some guy from Scotland who played a few games here in Rio de Janeiro is very vague," he says. "That's playing football, not implanting football. They are two completely different things. Charles Miller implanted football in the country: he created a club and helped to launch the first official championship." Back in Bangu, now an unfashionable suburb with a second division club, such arguments cut little ice. Molinari argues the town would have boasted the first football club in the country had it not been for the intervention of one of the managers of the textile factory, who believed all games, including football, would lead to degeneracy among his workers. By the time the factory owners relented, in 1904, the Sao Paulo league was already in its third season. But some Banguenses, while still asserting Donohoe's contribution has been overlooked, acknowledge a degree of local pride colours their reasoning. Benevenuto Rovere, 67, is one of the founders of the Gremio Literario Jose Mauro de Vasconcelos, Bangu's local museum. Inside the cavernous room are replicas of Donohoe's football and boots. On its walls are hundreds of black and white photos chronicling the town's history, including an image of Bangu Atletico Clube's line-up from 1905, which features Francisco Carregal, the first black man to play for a Brazilian football club. After he shows me around the museum, I ask Rovere if he would still support Donohoe's claim if he were not from Bangu. After a long pause, he answers: "It's in the blood, isn't it? I wouldn't swap my neighbourhood for any other. It's where I was born and it's where I've lived all my life. And every day I am more convinced that the birthplace of football is here in Bangu." </body>

      <body>Living for two years in Paris changed Vincent van Gogh. He might not have realised it at the time, but as he met other artists in the French capital, he gradually moved away from his dark, sombre Dutch works - towards much brighter palettes and expressive brush work. Van Gogh's transitional story is currently being told at the Eykyn Maclean Gallery in central London - with paintings by the artist and his contemporaries on show. Take a look with gallery partner, Nicholas Maclean. Van Gogh in Paris can be seen at the Eykyn Maclean Gallery in central London, until 29 November 2013. Reservations required.

      <title>Lance Armstrong, master storyteller</title>
      <description>Were fans too ready to believe cyclist's story?</description>

      <body>To his millions of fans, American cyclist and cancer survivor Lance Armstrong was more than just a great sportsman, he was an inspiration. To the film-maker who documented his spectacular fall from grace, he was a master storyteller. But were his supporters too ready to believe the fairytale? The story of the charismatic Texan cyclist who recovered from life-threatening cancer and went on to win the Tour de France a record seven successive times was one of the greatest tales in sporting history. In 2009, Lance Armstrong attempted to write another chapter into the legend by coming out of professional retirement to compete in the Tour again at the age of 37. He granted Oscar-winning filmmaker Alex Gibney rare access to his inner circle to chronicle the comeback. For Gibney, the experience was akin to being embedded with the military in a warzone. "When you're with a group of soldiers in Iraq or Afghanistan you're going to end up feeling part of their unit," he told me. "I don't think that's necessarily wrong. The trick is how to come out of that with some broader perspective - but it's intoxicating while you're in the middle of it." Gibney admits the "them and us" mentality inside Lance Armstrong's Astana cycling team encouraged a kind of Stockholm syndrome. Anyone who questioned his repeated denials that he had used performance-enhancing drugs came to be viewed as the enemy. "I did begin to feel that some people on the outside were a bit fanatical about the subject of whether Lance had doped," he says. "You can't help but take on the vibe of the team." Through the media and in the courts, Armstrong aggressively pursued critics who continued to question whether he was riding clean. Alex Gibney watched as his subject attempted to maintain control over the powerful and lucrative myth he had constructed. "I think the truth in the mind of someone who is a master storyteller does become elastic," he suggests. "There's a moment in the film when Lance loses in Verbier to Alberto Contador (on stage 15 of the 2009 Tour de France) and he says to me 'I'm sorry I screwed up your documentary.' "I don't think that was just banter. I think that was Lance's way of saying 'you came to me to deliver the fairytale that everyone's come to believe that I can deliver and I failed. I'm not going to win. I'm not going to be first and I'm sorry.'" After Armstrong's 2009 comeback, in which he finished third, the myth began to disintegrate. Former teammates went public with allegations of drug use. The US Anti-Doping Agency accused Armstrong of running the most sophisticated and extensive doping scheme in professional sports history. He finally came clean in an interview with talk show host Oprah Winfrey last January, in which he admitted taking banned substances and undergoing prohibited blood transfusions during all of his victorious Tour de France campaigns. In earlier films such as Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room, Taxi to the Dark Side and Mea Maxima Culpa, Alex Gibney has explored the abuse of power by big businesses, the military and the Catholic Church. In his latest film, it's Armstrong's rewriting of his own personal life story, a story that inspired and gave hope to cancer patients around the world, that Gibney finds particularly difficult to accept. "It's an abuse of storytelling power," he says. "He told a story that everyone wanted to believe in too much. He knew how much everybody wanted to believe in it. "He made the lie so enormous, so all-encompassing, that he couldn't dial it back. His only choice was to go forward and make it even bigger." So he carried on cheating, winning Tour after Tour. Stripped of those seven titles, pursued by lawyers seeking to reclaim prize and sponsorship money, Lance Armstrong's reputation as a sportsman is now in ruins. He has been banned from competitive cycling for life. For Alex Gibney, Lance Armstrong's epic downfall should serve as a cautionary tale. Even heroes, he argues, need to accept their flaws. "There can be inspirational stories that are messy," he says. "Spiderman to me is a more intriguing tale than Superman because you reckon with Peter Parker's dark past and to some extent his deep-seated anger rather than the pure hero that Superman is. "When we're told stories that seem too good to be true we should say to ourselves, 'Hey, maybe this is too good to be true.'" Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Major piracy site to be shut down</title>
      <description>IsoHunt, a major website that indexed illegal files, is to close and pay $110m (£68m) to a US movie industry body.</description>

      <body>IsoHunt, a popular website offering BitTorrents of mostly pirated material, is to shut down following a court settlement. The site's owner, Canadian Gary Fung, has agreed to pay $110m (£68m) to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). MPAA chairman Chris Dodd said the move was a "major step forward" for legitimate commerce online. In a blog post, Mr Fung said: "It's sad to see my baby go." The site is currently still online, but will soon be shut. It is one of the most popular sites of its kind on the internet. A group of companies, including Disney, Paramount and Twentieth Century Fox, accused the site of wilfully infringing copyright by listing millions of popular movies and TV programmes - in a court battle that has lasted for more than seven years. Now Mr Fung has agreed to settle. He added: "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race and I have remained faithful. 10.5 years of IsoHunt has been a long journey by any business definition and forever in internet start-up time. "It started as a programming hobby in my university days that has become so, so much more." Court documents acknowledged that it is unlikely that Mr Fung's company could pay $110m, and that the MPAA would probably receive between $2m and $4m. Like a similar site, The Pirate Bay, that has been blocked in the UK by a court order, IsoHunt did not host pirated material itself. It instead acted as a directory of sources from which to download illegal files. According to court documents, Mr Fung's defence hinged on this degree of separation - and argued that it was the users of IsoHunt responsible for distributing pirated material, not IsoHunt. The Californian court disagreed. "It sends a strong message that those who build businesses around encouraging, enabling, and helping others to commit copyright infringement are themselves infringers, and will be held accountable for their illegal actions," said MPAA chairman Mr Dodd. "The successful outcome of this landmark lawsuit will also will help preserve jobs and protect the tens of thousands of businesses in the creative industries, whose hard work and investments are exploited by sites like IsoHunt." Ahead of the ruling, Mr Fung had taken to social news site Reddit to take part in an AMAA - Ask Me Almost Anything - session. In it, he described himself as a "reluctant revolutionary", and backed calls for copyright reform. He said he did not hold a disregard for the law, and acted upon requests to remove links to pirated content when the company was made aware. He also said the industry could render sites like IsoHunt obsolete if it offered simultaneous releases worldwide, as well as digital offerings that were cheaper than physical copies. His thoughts echoed findings by a trio of researchers at George Mason University in Virginia, US. Their site piracydata.org has been collating the weekly top 10 most-pirated films and investigating whether legal digital methods were available. They found that half of the movies in the list were not available to access legally online. Furthermore, none of the 10 titles could be streamed - arguably the most straightforward way to consume media online. However, in contrast, efforts by Fox to curb piracy of TV series The Walking Dead fell flat. Despite the first episode of the latest series being made available to stream free online, the programme was still illegally downloaded more than 500,000 times, according to data gathered by Torrentfreak.com.

      <title>LED 'li-fi' step closer, says China</title>
      <description>Chinese scientists say they are closer to achieving wireless internet connectivity through light bulbs, rather than traditional radio frequencies.</description>

      <body>Wi-fi connectivity from a light bulb - or "li-fi" - has come a step closer, according to Chinese scientists. A microchipped bulb can produce data speeds of up to 150 megabits per second (Mbps), Chi Nan, IT professor at Shanghai's Fudan University told Xinhua News. A one-watt LED light bulb would be enough to provide net connectivity to four computers, researchers say. But experts told the BBC more evidence was needed to back up the claims. There are no supporting video or photos showing the technology in action. Li-fi, also known as visible light communications (VLC), at these speeds would be faster - and cheaper - than the average Chinese broadband connection. In 2011, Prof Harald Haas, an expert in optical wireless communications at the University of Edinburgh, demonstrated how an LED bulb equipped with signal processing technology could stream a high-definition video to a computer. He coined the term "light fidelity" or li-fi and set up a private company, PureVLC, to exploit the technology. "We're just as surprised as everyone else by this announcement," PureVLC spokesman Nikola Serafimovski told the BBC. "But how valid this is we don't know without seeing more evidence. We remain sceptical." This year, the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute claimed that data rates of up to 1Gbit/s per LED light frequency were possible in laboratory conditions, making one bulb with three colours potentially capable of transmitting data at up to 3Gbit/s. Li-fi promises to be cheaper and more energy-efficient than existing wireless radio systems given the ubiquity of LED bulbs and the fact that lighting infrastructure is already in place. Visible light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum and 10,000 times bigger than the radio spectrum, affording potentially unlimited capacity. But there are drawbacks: block the light and you block the signal. However, this is also a potential advantage from a security point of view. Light cannot penetrate walls as radio signals can, so drive-by hacking of wireless internet signals would be far more difficult, if not impossible. Prof Chi's research team includes scientists from the Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the report says. She admitted that the technology was still in its infancy and needed further developments in microchip design and optical communication controls before it could go mass market. Her team is hoping to show off sample li-fi kits at the China International Industry Fair in Shanghai on 5 November, the report said. </body>

      <body>The creators of legendary adventure game Myst are seeking cash for a new game via Kickstarter. Cyan Worlds is looking for $1.1m (£679,000) from the crowdfunding site to develop a game called Obduction. The game-maker said its new title would be a spiritual successor to its earlier point-and-click adventure games Myst and Riven. If Cyan reaches its funding target it plans to release PC and Mac versions of Obduction in mid-2015. Released in 1993, Myst was a huge hit thanks to its sumptuous look, detailed world-building and intricate puzzles. On its Kickstarter page, Cyan said Obduction would continue with these traditions but update them to take advantage of the power of modern computers. It said the game would use the Unreal 4 game development engine to create a detailed far-flung world that players find themselves upon at the start of the game. Playing Obduction involves exploring the world, solving puzzles and working out why the player has been abducted and taken to the alien planet. The cash being sought was for the most basic version of the game, said Cyan. Cash raised beyond the original total would go towards making the game world bigger and moving the title to other gaming gadgets beyond PCs. Cyan said it was turning to Kickstarter because it allowed the company to connect with fans, meant it had control of development and ensured everyone involved had an intimate link to the project. Nathan Grayson at PC game news website Rock, Paper Shotgun said the "meagre" information provided by Cyan did not give a good idea about how the final game might turn out. He wondered if the game would reach its funding target despite getting pledges of more than $100,000 within a day of being kicked off. "Obduction really does feel like it'd be a shoo-in if it wasn't currently a pile of napkin scrawlings and a series of excited hand gestures," he wrote. </body>

      <body>Google shares have topped $1,000 (£617) for the first time after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. The company posted a 36% jump in net profits to $2.97bn for the July-to-September period. Shares in the giant online search and ads company rose more than 13% to $1,006, and are now up 41% since the start of 2013. Google's revenues also beat forecasts with a 12% rise year-on-year. "We are closing in on our goal of a beautiful, simple, and intuitive experience regardless of your device," Google's chief Larry Page said in a conference call with analysts. The strong earnings report also helped other online companies, with Facebook shares adding 4.4% to a new high of more than $55. Amazon rose 3.4%. At $1,000 a share, Google's market value is about $334bn, which is still well below Apple's $461bn. Google was floated in August 2004 at $85 a share, giving the company a market value at the time of $23bn. The company reported its quarterly earnings on Thursday after US markets had closed. Google said that paid-for clicks increased by a quarter during the July-to-September period, from a year earlier, the highest rate of growth in the past year. This offset an 8% fall in average cost-per-click, the price advertisers pay Google when consumers click on their ads. "We view solid paid clicks growth to be a good indicator of demand, driven by the continued shift to mobile," JP Morgan analysts said in a note. Several brokers have raised their share price target for Google on the back of the company's new initiatives to attract advertisers. In February, the company launched a service to help advertisers market through a mix of smartphones, tablets and desktop computers. And analysts believe there is still significant potential to generate revenues from its video-streaming website YouTube. YouTube-branded video-ads surged more than 75% in the quarter from a year earlier, with 40% of traffic now coming from mobile devices. "We estimate that Google's key YouTube asset generated approximately $4bn in revenue in 2012, positioning Google extremely well for the strong growth in video advertising," RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. Analysts at Jefferies said Google is best positioned to benefit from mobile devices with one billion activations of its Android system. Google sells applications and content through its Google Play store. </body>

      <title>Windows 8.1 gets global release</title>
      <description>Microsoft has released the Windows 8.1 update for its flagship operating system.</description>

      <body>Microsoft has released the Windows 8.1 update for its flagship operating system. The download seeks to address some of the criticisms levelled at the original version of Windows 8. In particular, the update restores the start button and allows a computer to boot up with a traditional desktop interface. The launch comes at a critical time for Microsoft as it seeks a new boss, with PC sales experiencing a long decline. Windows 8 sought to bridge the gap between touchscreen devices, such as tablets and smartphones, and more traditional form laptops and desktop machines. As such it had an interface built of tiles that could be tapped or swiped to open applications. However, many people found the tiled interface did not work well for some of the things they were used to doing with a computer. The changes in 8.1 include: A host of other changes, including better support for multi-tasking and improved links to Microsoft's Xbox game console, are also in the update. Windows 8 was created to capitalise on the growing popularity of tablets and other portable gadgets. Microsoft needs to get people using its software on these machines because sales of desktop machines are in sharp decline. Global shipments of PCs hit a five-year low in early October, according to figures from market research firm Gartner. Sales of PCs had now fallen for six quarters in a row, it added. The downward trend in sales statistics were confirmed by IDC, which added that the decline would probably continue into 2014. The shrinking sales are important for Microsoft because traditionally the bulk of its revenue comes from people and companies buying laptops and desktops and office software to run on them. It is not clear that Microsoft is adjusting to the changes in the types of gadgets that people use. In July, Microsoft wrote off $900m (£559m) following poor sales of its own-brand Surface touchscreen devices. At the same time, Microsoft has undergone a major reorganisation and has bought phone maker Nokia. It is also launching a new version of its Xbox games console and has begun searching for a new chief executive. Servers ready to dispense the update were turned on at 07:00 New York time (12:00 BST). The update is free to those already running Windows 8. Charges will apply if users upgrade to 8.1 from Windows 7. The update comes just over a year after the launch of Windows 8. </body>

      <body>US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden has insisted he took no classified documents to Russia when he fled to Moscow from Hong Kong in June. He told the New York Times he had given all the papers to journalists in Hong Kong and had kept no copies. Mr Snowden, who worked for two US spy agencies, also said no confidential information had been passed to China. The US authorities want Mr Snowden extradited to face trial, but Russia has refused to hand him over. The Russian authorities gave him a one-year visa earlier this year after he claimed asylum. Mr Snowden told the US newspaper that he did not take any of the documents because it would not have been in the public interest. "What would be the unique value of personally carrying another copy of the materials onward," he said. Claims had surfaced in media reports that China was likely to have gained some intelligence from the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor before he left Hong Kong. Some analysts had suggested he was working with Chinese intelligence, while others said he was working with the Russians. But Mr Snowden rebuffed these claims, saying: "There's a zero per cent chance the Russians or Chinese have received any documents." He said his last job for the NSA had focused on China, and he had "access to every target", so he felt confident that the data was safe from Chinese agencies. The New York Times report said its interview was conducted over several days via encrypted networks. The information leaked by Mr Snowden has led to claims of systematic spying by the NSA and CIA on a global scale of governments, businesses and members of the public. Targets have included rivals like China and Russia, as well as close allies like the EU and Brazil. The NSA was also forced to admit it captured email and phone data from millions of Americans. </body>

      <title>Adidas smartwatch has pulse sensor</title>
      <description>Adidas announces a touchscreen colour watch that can measure its owner's heart-rate to create tailored training programmes.</description>

      <body>A watch with a colour touchscreen and built-in heart monitor that studies the wearer's pulse to create training programmes has been unveiled by Adidas. The gadget - which is being targeted at runners - also includes a GPS location chip to maximise the accuracy of its readings. It marks a move by the German firm into the smartwatch sector, although the device does not run third-party apps. The news comes the same week as rival Nike updated its own activity tracker. The two companies - which are best known for their sports clothing and shoe ranges - are taking different approaches with their flagship products. At $399 (£350 in the UK) Adidas's Micoach Smart Run is more than double the price of Nike's $149 Fuelband SE. But it offers a wider range of sensors as well as the ability to play MP3 audio files to wireless headphones via Bluetooth. It also has the advantage of offering partner apps for Android, Windows Phone and iOS devices. By contrast, Nike only offers a Fuelband app for the iPhone. The US firm does, however, offer a separate Nike-branded watch made by the Dutch firm TomTom that features a GPS chip and can be paired with a heart rate strap made by another company. Adidas announced its new product at Gigaom's Mobilize conference in San Francisco. It said athletes could use the watch to create a coaching programme to improve their fitness levels and would then receive feedback via animated graphics on its screen, vibrations, and audio commands - using paired headphones - telling them to speed up or slow down. The new device is bigger than less advanced digital watches and screenless activity trackers also sold by Adidas, but its 1.45in (3.7cm) display is smaller than the screens on Samsung and Sony's new smartwatches. The Galaxy Gear and Smartwatch 2 both offer a range of activity apps of their own as well as other Android software, but rely on being paired with a smartphone for much of their functionality. Adidas says its product's battery lasts about 14 days when its tracking sensors are switched off. However, that drops to just four hours when it is switched into "training mode". Motorola's Motoactv watch may be its closest competitor. The gadget also features a GPS chip and MP3 player, but not a pulse rate sensor of its own. Consultancy Juniper Research recently predicted the wider wearable tech market will grow from $1.4bn of sales this year to $19bn by 2018. However, it suggested that sales of specialist fitness tracking equipment and watches that are, in effect, slaves to smartphones will be cannibalised by more powerful standalone devices. "The products currently available in the market only appeal to a niche demographic, but as we move towards the age of a true multifunctional smartwatch we expect them to become more appealing," said its senior analyst Nitin Bhas. "We believe players like Apple, Google and Microsoft will release devices that can acts as a fitness tracker, as a digital wallet, as a way of offering ticketing and coupons, and all sorts of other things. To be honest, the market is still waiting for a killer app. "There is an opportunity for Adidas here - but along with start-ups entering the wearable tech sector, it has a very narrow window and is likely to struggle as the marketplace becomes increasingly crowded." Adidas said it would start selling the new watch next month. </body>

      <body>The Advertising Standards Authority has ordered EE to change its mobile coverage checker after a customer complained it had wrongly told him he would receive excellent service in his area. The checker must make it clearer that it is only a guide, the ASA said. The decision is likely to have an impact on other mobile operators offering similar maps. Mobile coverage can vary widely from street to street. It depends on a variety of factors, including the density of buildings and the number of trees in the area. Despite the fact that the EE coverage map has an addendum which states that it is "only a guide and not guarantee of service availability in a particular location", the ASA still felt the ad was misleading Its ruling stated: "We noted that the claims under the coverage results were presented in language that was not conditional and consider the overall impression of the ad was such that it was likely to be understood to mean that fast reliable internet access and high quality calling was available... to consumers in the relevant postcode." In response EE said: "The Coverage Checker offers a prediction of our network coverage across the UK. In this instance, we deemed coverage to be Excellent in the postcode as confirmed by testing that found over 98% of the postcode had an excellent signal." "We take on board the ASA's ruling and will amend the disclaimer language as necessary," it added. EE customers are given a 14-day cooling off period if they are not happy with the mobile service after signing a new contract. O2 also points out that customers have a seven-day window to cancel their service if they find it is not as good as expected. "Our coverage maps are created on accurate predictions of the network, but unfortunately they can't always take into account a number of factors affecting signal like building structures and natural landscape," the mobile firm said in a statement. "We're making daily improvements to our network and our coverage maps for 2G, 3G and 4G are updated to reflect these on a weekly basis." Most operators have ambitious plans for 4G coverage, both indoors and outdoors, with most planning to reach around 98% of the population by 2017. But it is notoriously hard to produce accurate mobile coverage maps. All the operators produce their own and use different metrics for measuring coverage. Some have called on Ofcom to produce its own coverage map, something that the regulator has rejected. There are a few independent coverage maps available from firms such as RootMetrics and OpenSignal. Matthew Howett, analyst with research firm Ovum said: "While the operator's own coverage checkers are usually very accurate, they don't all necessarily measure the same thing. For instance some might only be for outdoor coverage, whereas others will also give you an idea what you can expect indoors. "Given these peculiarities, they are useful only up to a point for consumers when making comparisons between networks," he added. </body>

      <body>Google has reported a profit of $2.97bn (£1.84bn) during the July -September period, beating expectations. The company missed forecasts during the last quarter. However, a closely watched measure, cost per click - how much advertisers pay to place an advert - declined by 8% from the same period last year. Shares in the company jumped to an all time high in after hours trading, rising 6% to $941.25. Google boss Larry Page said in a statement that: "Google had another strong quarter with...great product progress". Overall, paid clicks increased by 28% from the same time last year, and were up 8% from the previous quarter. This is taken as a good sign by analysts, as advertising makes up the dominant share of Google's profits. The company's troubled Motorola unit continued to be a drag on the figures, however. It lost Google $248m, despite the launch of the flagship Moto X phone in August. Mobile battle In a call to discuss earnings with investors, Mr Page highlighted just how dominant mobile has become among consumers. He said that 40% of users reached YouTube through their mobile phones compared to just 6% two years earlier. Analysts were closely watching how Google is faring in this mobile transition, particularly as it relates to advertising. Google charges less for mobile than for its traditional web browser ads, which is why even though ad sales increased throughout the quarter, the cost per click figure declined. Research firm eMarketer estimates that the mobile ad market worldwide will grow 89% to $16.65bn this year; up from $8.8bn in 2012. Google's market share in the ad market is 6.9%. This has recently slipped slightly as rival Facebook has made inroads. Facebook now has 14.9% of the market, a jump from 9% last year. In a personal move, Mr Page said that he would no longer be participating in every earnings call. While he said this move was intended to better prioritise his time, many observers noted that his voice remained strained after surgery to repair an injured vocal chord. </body>

      <body>Oracle has released a bumper update package for Java that closes lots of security holes in the software. The update fixes 51 separate security bugs in Java, which owner Oracle says is used on billions of devices. About a dozen of the bugs were serious enough to allow attackers to take remote control of a compromised system, researchers said. Java is one of the most popular targets for cyber-thieves and malware writers seeking to hijack home computers. In its advisory about the update, Oracle urged customers to patch the software as soon as possible "due to the threat posed by a successful attack". Programming language Java has proved popular because software written with it can easily be made to run on many different types of computer. Twelve of the holes in Java addressed by the update topped the table that ranked the severity of security weaknesses in software, wrote Qualys security expert Wolfgang Kandek in a blogpost. If these bugs were exploited, attackers could bypass ID controls and take over a target system, he added. He said those seeking to exploit Java would probably seed web pages with booby-trapped links in a bid to catch vulnerable machines. Security glitches in Java are favourites among those that write and run so-called "exploit kits" that seek to compromise vulnerable websites and other systems. Security blogger Brian Krebs said if people needed to run Java, it was well worth taking time to apply the update. Those that did not need the software should consider disabling it altogether, he said. "This widely installed and powerful program is riddled with security holes, and is a top target of malware writers and miscreants," he wrote. The update is available via the main Java website and has prompted follow-up action from other electronics firms. Apple has released an update to the version of Java that runs on its computers. This update points people towards the official version of Java from Oracle instead of that supplied by Apple. In the past, Apple has faced criticism over the speed with which it updated its version of Java. </body>

      <title>Watch Dogs delay wounds games maker</title>
      <description>More than a quarter of Ubisoft's market value is wiped out after the French video games publisher delays the launch of hacker-themed title Watch Dogs.</description>

      <body>Shares in video games firm Ubisoft have slumped by 26% after it delayed the release of two much-anticipated titles. Hacker-themed Watch Dogs and open-world racing game The Crew have both been postponed until the publisher's next financial year, which begins in April. The company said it wanted to allow its developers to fine tune their work. Watch Dogs had been due to go on sale on 19 November and will miss out on being a launch title for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Retailers, including Amazon and Gamestop, have assured consumers who had pre-ordered bundles including both the Chicago-based title and one of the games consoles that they will still receive the machine on the day they had been quoted. The Crew had originally been due out some time in the first three months of 2014. France-based Ubisoft has had success with its Assassin's Creed, Just Dance and Splinter Cell franchises. However, it warned that the delays meant it was likely to swing to an operating loss when it declares its full-year results. Chief executive Yves Guillemo called the move a "tough decision". "We are building franchises that will become perennial pillars of Ubisoft's financial performance," he added. "In a context of growing successes for mega-blockbusters, the additional time given to the development of our titles will allow them to fulfil their huge ambitions and thus offer players even more exceptional experiences." A blog posted by the Watch Dogs development team added that it planned to launch the game before the end of June. "As we got closer to release, as all the pieces of the puzzle were falling into place in our last push before completion, it became clear to us that we needed to take the extra time to polish and fine tune each detail so we can deliver a truly memorable and exceptional experience," it stated. Ubisoft added that The Crew would now go on sale before the end of September. The news caught many analysts by surprise. To make its November debut, the "gold master" version of Watch Dogs' code would have needed to have been finalised soon in order for the discs to be manufactured and shipped to stores in time. It is unusual, though not unknown, for a game to be pulled so late in development. In February, Ubisoft delayed its platformer Rayman Legends by half a year, less than a month before it had been due to go on sale. Perhaps the best known example was Valve's announcement in 2003 that its sci-fi action sequel Half-Life 2 was to be delayed, just a week before its scheduled launch date. It went on to become one of the best reviewed games of all time. One industry watcher said a short-term view by investors had caused the firm's stock to dive, but that Ubisoft was better off doing this than releasing Watch Dogs in a state that required later software patches to address major faults. "I think it was going to be one of the drivers for initial games-console bundle sales and will probably push back some of the hardware sales that would have happened right out of the gate for Sony and Microsoft," said Lewis Ward, video games research manager at consultants IDC. "But absolutely it's the right decision if there's something glitchy or there's some game-balance factor that is off. "There's a lot of interconnections between the things you can control in the game and how the story then unfolds, so I can only assume there's some factor with the incredibly complex open-world gameplay that's off. "But there's no reason Ubisoft can't still deliver what they hoped to do with this game." </body>

      <title>Samsung offers to end patent wars</title>
      <description>To avoid a huge fine for allegations that it has abused the patent system, Samsung has waved the white flag on patent wars.</description>

      <body>Samsung has said that it will stop taking rivals to court over certain patent infringements for the next five years. The white flag in the patent battle has been raised because the South Korean electronics firm faces a huge fine for alleged abuses of the system. The move could help end a long-running patent war between the world's largest mobile makers. The EU said that a resolution would bring "clarity to the industry". "Samsung has offered to abstain from seeking injunctions for mobile SEPs (standard essential patents) for a period of five years against any company that agrees to a particular licensing framework," the European Commission said in a statement. Standard essential patents refer to inventions recognised as being critical to implementing an industry standard technology. Examples of such technologies include the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), a cellular standard at the heart of 3G data; and H.264, a video compression format used by YouTube, Blu-ray disks and Adobe Flash Player among others. The EU had accused the Samsung of stifling competition by bringing a series of SEP lawsuits against Apple and other rivals. Google's Motorola Mobility has been charged with similar anti-competitive practice. Samsung faced a $18.3bn (£11.3bn) fine if it was found guilty of breaching anti-trust laws. "Enforcing patents through injunctions can be perfectly legitimate, said Joaquin Almunia, the European Commission's vice-president in charge of competition policy. "However, when patents are standard-essential, abuses must be prevented so that standard-setting works properly and consumers do not have to suffer negative consequences from the so-called patent wars. "If we reach a good solution in this case, it will bring clarity to the industry," he added. Samsung and Apple are currently battling each other in courts in more than 10 countries across Europe. Interested parties have been given a month to comment on the proposals. </body>

      <title>Underwater wi-fi given test run</title>
      <description>A team from Buffalo, New York, has been testing "underwater wi-fi" as it attempts to create an internet for the oceans.</description>

      <body>Researchers have tested an "underwater wi-fi" network in a lake in an attempt to make a "deep-sea internet". The team, from the University of Buffalo, New York, said the technology could help detect tsunamis, offering more reliable warning systems. They aim to create an agreed standard for underwater communications, to make interaction and data-sharing easier. Unlike normal wi-fi, which uses radio waves, the submerged network technology utilises sound waves. Radio waves are able to penetrate water, but with severely limited range and stability. Sound waves provide a better option - as demonstrated by many aquatic species such as whales and dolphins. Wireless communication underwater has been possible for some time, but the problem lies in getting separate systems used by different organisations to communicate with each other. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), for instance, uses acoustic waves to send data from tsunami sensors on the sea floor to buoys on the surface. However due to infrastructure differences, this data cannot be shared quickly with other information gathered by the US Navy. Therefore, the University of Buffalo team is attempting to create a shared standard. "A submerged wireless network will give us an unprecedented ability to collect and analyse data from our oceans in real time," said Tommaso Melodia, lead researcher. "Making this information available to anyone with a smartphone or computer, especially when a tsunami or other type of disaster occurs, could help save lives." The test was carried out at Lake Erie, near Buffalo. The research team dropped two 40lb (18kg) sensors into the water - and were then able to use a laptop to transmit information to them. In future, the team hopes the sensors could be used to help detect and solve environmental issues. With a shared standard, different research groups with varied equipment could potentially combine their data gathering efforts with greater ease, and in real-time. More details of the team's work will be presented at a conference for underwater networking to be held in Taiwan next month. </body>

      <title>3D printing 'entering the metal age'</title>
      <description>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion reactors.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24528306</url>

      <body>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion projects. The Amaze project brings together 28 institutions to develop new metal components which are lighter, stronger and cheaper than conventional parts. Additive manufacturing (or "3D printing") has already revolutionised the design of plastic products. Printing metal parts for rockets and planes would cut waste and save money. The layered method of assembly also allows intricate designs - geometries which are impossible to achieve with conventional metal casting. Parts for cars and satellites can be optimised to be lighter and - simultaneously - incredibly robust. Tungsten alloy components that can withstand temperatures of 3,000C were unveiled at Amaze's launch on Tuesday at London's Science Museum. At such extreme temperatures they can survive inside nuclear fusion reactors and on the nozzles of rockets. "We want to build the best quality metal products ever made. Objects you can't possibly manufacture any other way," said David Jarvis, Esa's head of new materials and energy research. "To build a [fusion reactor], like Iter, you somehow have to take the heat of the Sun and put it in a metal box. "3,000C is as hot as you can imagine for engineering. "If we can get 3D metal printing to work, we are well on the way to commercial nuclear fusion." Additive manufacturing with metal is not new; General Electric, for example, has used the technique to make fuel injectors for one of its aircraft engines. China claims to be using 3D printing to manufacture load-bearing components in aircraft. And in July, Nasa announced that it had successfully tested a 3D-printed rocket engine part. Amaze is a loose acronym for Additive Manufacturing Aiming Towards Zero Waste and Efficient Production of High-Tech Metal Products. The 20m-euro project brings together 28 partners from European industry and academia - including Airbus, Astrium, Norsk Titanium, Cranfield University, EADS, and the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. Factory sites are being set up in France, Germany, Italy, Norway and the UK to develop the industrial supply chain. Amaze researchers have already begun printing metal jet engine parts and aeroplane wing sections up to 2m in size. These high-strength components are typically built from expensive, exotic metals such as titanium, tantalum and vanadium. Using traditional techniques to fashion metal objects often wastes precious raw material. Whereas additive manufacturing - building parts up layer-on-layer from 3D digital data - has the potential to produce almost "zero waste". "To produce one kilo of metal, you use one kilo of metal - not 20 kilos," says Esa's Franco Ongaro. "We need to clean up our act - the space industry needs to be more green. And this technique will help us." Printing objects as a single piece - without welding or bolting - can make them both stronger and lighter. A weight reduction of even 1kg for a long-range aircraft will save hundreds of thousands of dollars over its lifespan. "Our ultimate aim is to print a satellite in a single piece. One chunk of metal, that doesn't need to be welded or bolted," said Jarvis. "To do that would save 50% of the costs - millions of euros." But Jarvis is candid about the problems and inefficiencies that still need to be overcome - what he calls the "dirty secrets" of 3D printing. "One common problem is porosity - small air bubbles in the product. Rough surface finishing is an issue too," he said. "We need to understand these defects and eliminate them - if we want to achieve industrial quality. "And we need to make the process repeatable - scale it up. "We can't do all this unless we collaborate between industries - space, fusion, aeronautics. "We need all these teams working together and sharing." </body>

      <title>Flossie the computer to be rebooted</title>
      <description>The National Museum of Computing announces plans to resurrect one of the oldest business computers still in existence.</description>

      <body>Efforts to reboot one of the oldest surviving mass-produced computers are under way in Milton Keynes. The National Museum of Computing has taken delivery of what it believes is the last ICT 1301 computer to ever have a chance of working again. The machine - known as Flossie - had originally been used to produce exam results for students at the University of London. The museum hopes to put it on display by 2016. One of its trustees said Flossie was one of the first computers specifically designed for use by UK businesses rather than scientific institutions. "Before this time, computers were absolutely huge with valves and thousands of vacuum tubes and would get incredibly hot, making them difficult to house in a normal business," Kevin Murrell, a trustee of the museum, told the BBC. "But this machine used transistors, which used very little power. That meant you could have more of them in the same space, you didn't need the complex cooling equipment and you wouldn't require the high power that earlier computers needed." ICT 1301s had a footprint of about 6m by 7m (20ft by 23ft) and weighed some five tonnes. They came with a punch card reader and printer built in to their body, which were used to enter and save data by means of creating a series of holes in a piece of stiff paper. "For medium-sized companies that wanted to computerise their invoicing, their accounting or their payroll, this gave them the help to do that," added Mr Murrell. The University of London bought its machine in the 1960s and used it for accounting and administration tasks in addition to generating GCE examination results for students in England and Wales. It was later sold at scrap metal value to a group of students before eventually ending up at a farm in Kent, whose owner donated the machine to the museum. Other editions of the machine were later used as props thanks to their arresting design. Doctor Who, the Pink Panther and the James Bond movie The Man with the Golden Gun all featured ICT 1301s. Over the years more than 150 computers were created, but the charity said it was only aware of three others being left in existence, all of which are beyond repair. "One of the problems with computers as museum artefacts is that when they are switched off they are fairly boring - it's fairly difficult to learn anything from them," explained Mr Murrell. "So ideally we want it switched on, and once we've restored it we will be able to run the original software. "We will have caused some damage in the move, so we need to deal with that, but I think in about three years' time we will have a properly demonstrable machine." </body>

      <body>Anne-Marie Imafidon is in a rush to get on with life. Perhaps that is why she passed a GCSE in computer science aged 10, became the youngest graduate to attain a masters degree, aged 19, and is already planning the future of her unborn children. And if daughters come along she is clear that she doesn't want them to "feel like the odd ones out," if they decide, like her, to pursue a career in technology. As a self-confessed stubborn woman, she hopes she can succeed where others have failed - in reducing the huge gap between girls and boys studying so-called Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths. To do this, she has set up Stemettes, which she runs when she isn't in her day job at a global investment bank. She was one of just three girls in a class of 70 studying maths and computer science at university. "At the time I wasn't that bothered, I just thought it was part and parcel of studying computer science," she says. "But then last year I spoke at a conference and I heard that the numbers of women in technology was in decline and I thought, 'That isn't right.' "Technology is at the forefront of the economy and women have a vital role to play. When my daughters are born I don't want them to feel like the odd ones out." The UK has a massive skills gap. Only 17% of the UK's tech jobs are held by women. In Stem subjects generally women make up just 13% of the workforce. In engineering women fare even worse, taking up just 8% of the jobs. So where does it all go wrong? At secondary school, girls are as likely as boys to study Stem subjects, at least up to GCSE, but for A-levels and beyond, female representation drops off dramatically. And among girls who carry on and study science at university, two out of three don't go on to Stem-related careers. The reasons for the drop-off in interest are multiple, thinks Ms Imafidon. "Some schools, often girl-only schools, simply don't offer ICT [information and communications technology] at A-level and the girls wanting to do it have to go to a nearby boys school to learn it," she says. "In other schools, computer science often clashes with things like drama or music, meaning the girls can't do both. If every other girl is doing drama, you'd want to be in a class with all your friends rather than take the difficult route and do computer science." Girls are very aware that their choice of A-level subjects impacts what they study at university and which one they go to. It means that girls tend to choose "safe" subjects that they know they will get a good grade in, according to Ms Imafidon. "Choosing computer science is an unnecessarily tough choice and one you aren't going to make unless you are one of the stubborn girls like I was," she says. It isn't like that everywhere. Brazil punches above its weight, ranking highest overall in the representation of women in science and technology, according to a report from Women in Global Science and Technology. Much of that is down to programmes that support women in the workforce, good funding for education and research and support of female entrepreneurship. South Africa and India also score well. For Ms Imafidon, it is because ITC has a very different image and status in these countries. "In India if you go into technology, it is because you want to do well and get ahead in life. If you see a well-dressed women walking down the street, you don't ask is she a lawyer or a banker but is she working in IT," she says. The aim of Stemettes and other sister organisations is to replicate in the West what is happening in the developing world. To facilitate that, the group runs events around the country aimed at getting girls interested in technology. Girls are introduced to a range of women already working in Stem subjects and are invited to take part in events such as hackathons. "We get them making mobile apps, data visualisations, having fun," says Ms Imafidon. The fact that they can do all this surrounded by other girls makes them more confident. "Coding clubs are dominated by boys. We want to make our club as normal for girls as ballet," says Ms Imafidon. At the end of the month the group will host a hackathon in Oxford, and in November it is running an exhibition at the Crystal in London's docklands. Girls aged from seven to 22 will be invited to take a variety of workshops, including dance and science, 3D printing and one on nuclear substances. The goal of Stemettes and its sister organisations is to get the women in the Stem workforce up to 30% by 2020. When you consider that women began coding 200 years ago, it seems like a fairly realistic ambition. This week saw the annual Ada Lovelace day, which every year celebrates the achievements of the Victorian woman credited with writing the first piece of code for Charles Babbage's analytical engine. The fact that Mrs Lovelace was coding in an age when even few men were, shows that there is no inherent aptitude problem, thinks Ms Imafidon. "It isn't that girls can't do it, it is that they are choosing not to do it," she says. "She was doing it 200 years ago so we have no excuse." </body>

      <body>Olive Uwineza is 12 years old and dreams of becoming president one day. She sits in a class of about 30 pupils, at a high-tech primary school in Kigali, Rwanda. Each student has a green, white and orange laptop that uses cartoon animations to make lessons more fun. A lover of maths and science, Olive says tackling these subjects without computers "can make my lessons difficult". Five years ago, an initiative called One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) was introduced to the school, led by the government and NGOs. It has seen 200,000 laptops distributed in more than 400 schools across this tiny east African nation. Facilities at Olive's school have been upgraded and modernised, with access to wi-fi, and software tailored for the curriculum. The OLPC programme is one of the pillars of Rwanda's Vision 2020, which aims to turn the country into a knowledge-based economy similar to that of Singapore in South East Asia. In the wood-panelled halls of his official office, we meet President Paul Kagame, who has personally been a driver of this vision. He says information technology will help to turn Rwanda into a regional tech hub that will help Rwandans "find jobs, feed their children and regain their dignity". The tragedy of the 1994 genocide is a strong motivation for President Kagame. In his view, better access to information might have helped victims and perpetrators make different political choices. For him, the IT revolution is not only about modernising the Rwandan economy - at the core, it's about healing the nation. Mr Kagame has presided over an era of robust growth in Rwanda. Last year, the economy grew by more than 7%. Government reforms have encouraged foreign investment and the World Bank has ranked Rwanda the third best country in sub-Saharan Africa in its "Doing Business" index. But all of this could be undermined by the recent diplomatic tensions with donors. Rwanda has been accused of helping train child soldiers for rebels in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, though it has strongly rejected the allegations. In October, the US imposed sanctions on Rwanda, which may have an impact on the government's ability to pursue future economic programmes that support Vision 2020. Undeterred, government agencies continue with their work. Clare Akamanzi is the chief executive of the Rwanda Development Board, tasked with turning Vision 2020 into tangible social programmes. She says Rwanda aspires to "evolve from being an agriculture-based economy to a knowledge-based economy, mainly on high value services". In 2013 a deal was concluded with Korea Telecom to provide 4G technology across the country. At $140m (£87m) this is one of the biggest foreign direct investment deals in Rwanda. The state has laid 3,000km of fibre-optic cables over the last four years and hopes that 4G will help provide last-mile access to all communities outside of the capital, where internet connectivity is low. Clare Akamanzi says they are taking additional steps to ensure this happens. "We've built tele-centres, we've built service points, there's a communal infrastructure where we've put computers," she says. "We've also used ICT buses where we take mobile buses all over the country so people can just come and learn how to use a computer." But new technology isn't working for everyone. At a grain market on the outskirts of Kigali, traders are buying sorghum from local farmers. A mobile phone application called e-Soko was given to farmers in 2007. The app is designed to save farmers time and help them find the best deal, by sending automated text messages with the latest market prices. The farmers here, though, say they still prefer the more traditional method of face-to-face bartering. "When I call with my phone there's that possibility of an interaction," farmer Jean Baptiste Nzabamwita says. "We can bargain and say come, we can raise the price up to this one. But [with] the e-Soko... the prices are not reliable." This is just one small example of how society can sometimes resist the changes brought about by IT. Rwanda is still a largely traditional and rural country, therefore attempts to modernise the economy will have to go apace with the needs of the population at large. So does President Kagame's IT agenda come at the expense of more practical realities like healthcare, housing and rural development? His answer is simple: "The proof of the pudding is in the eating…. and we've been rewarded by progress." </body>

      <title>Silk Road: Will cybercrime evolve?</title>
      <description>Is society safer after the illegal marketplace's demise?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24526677</url>

      <body>Silk Road, the infamous online marketplace for drugs and other illegal goods, was closed down by the FBI earlier this month. Since then its alleged founder, Ross Ulbricht - who denies being the site's operator known as Dread Pirate Roberts - has been taken into custody, and police forces around the world have been making arrests. It is a blow to the sale and distribution of harmful substances, including cocaine and heroin, as well as disrupting other criminal activities arranged online, such as the sale of weapons and hitmen for hire. But for how long will society have been made safer? Does it mean the end for illegal marketplaces hidden in the so-called "deep web", which depend on the anonymity provided by the Tor network and the Bitcoin digital currency to attract buyers and sellers? Or is it little more than a minor inconvenience? One man with first-hand experience of FBI takedowns is Emmanuel Gadaix. He was one of the directors of Megaupload, the popular file-sharing website founded by Kim Dotcom that was closed down by the US Department of Justice in January 2012. "This changes nothing in the same way that the closure of Megaupload changed nothing," he says. "All that happens if you bust him [Dread Pirate Roberts] is that two new people come along. "The closure of Silk Road is no more the end of online narcotics sales as the arrest of Al Capone was the end of organised crime." Another man with similar experience is a twenty-something expat Irishman who calls himself H2.0. He is the ex-spokesman for a deep web drugs marketplace called Atlantis, which was closed down by its operators shortly before the Silk Road takedown for "security reasons". Criminals may be more than willing to prey on others, but when it comes to their own dealings they want to feel safe, and H2.0 says Silk Road had managed to build a strong brand in the underworld. "It was a pillar of trust in an otherwise Wild West of dodgy scamsites," he says. But he is sure an alternative to Silk Road will emerge. "We could be in for a period of sites popping up for a few months and closing [just] as fast. Silk Road will be replaced fast but the trust will take longer." Other marketplaces for illegal goods still exist in the deep web - Sheep and Black Market Reloaded (BMR) are two of the better-known ones - and it appears that former Silk Road sellers are already setting up shop in them. "I do know one vendor who was previously one of the top-selling vendors on Atlantis," H2.0 adds. "He moved to Silk Road as soon as Atlantis closed, and two weeks after Silk Road closed he is already set up on Sheep and BMR. "Vendors even seem confident enough to carry forward the same usernames and reputations from Silk Road, which shows they don't seem too worried about being tracked." But security expert Brian Krebs thinks the takedown is significant. "It once again dispels the myth of anonymity on the web, or in this case on the deep web," he suggests. "That's a big deal because clearly many buyers and sellers in this community were under the impression that their actions somehow could not be traced online." In the future, illegal deep web marketplaces are likely to attempt to reassure drug dealers and their customers that their communications with each other are secure by making it easy to encrypt conversations. It turns out that a software package called BitWasp that aims to provide this is already under development, and as an open source project will be available free to anyone who wants it. The man behind BitWasp is known in internet circles as afk11. He currently spends between 30 and 50 hours a week developing it, he tells the BBC. He describes himself as unemployed, 21 years old and from Ireland. Afk11 claims his motivation is to help promote the virtual currency Bitcoin, suggesting it could become a popular way to pay for concert tickets and other events. "Just because people want to remain private doesn't mean things are suspicious," he says. But does he believe that drugs marketplace operators will also use his software? "The short answer would be yes, they probably will," afk11 says. "We're not specifically gearing our project towards the 'dark web' although it will certainly have features which are popular on it, such as PGP encryption. "But it's more important to us that Bitcoin becomes adopted by the masses." The next generation of illegal marketplace operators will be much harder for the FBI or other law enforcement agencies to catch, according to a Bangkok-based security expert and broker of security exploits known as the Grugq. "You can be famous, or a criminal, but you can't be a famous criminal," he says. "[Dread Pirate Roberts] was advertising everywhere and attracting attention - which is never a good thing." He says that the new marketplaces will last longer because the operators won't make the same mistakes. "Each bust works as evolutionary pressure, selecting out the insecure sites and training the other ones what to do better, so there will be better and better services (for buyers and sellers) with each iteration of these marketplaces after each bust," he says. Mr Krebs concurs: "Denizens of these communities will learn from their mistakes... with the result that the up-and-coming communities probably will be more difficult to penetrate and take down." But the Grugq believes that despite the protection and anonymity that Tor, Bitcoin and encryption can provide, many marketplaces and their users will get caught thanks to old-fashioned police techniques. "What you will see with these sites is that as they become higher-profile, undercover agents will infiltrate them as vendors or customers," he says. "They may even work their way into the inner circle and become administrators working for the site." One thing the Silk Road takedown has done is show that operators of illegal marketplaces can and do get caught. And ultimately it's the fear of that happening that may put many people off embarking on a criminal career in the deep web. "I think a legit career move is best for me," H2.0 concludes. "Whoever wants to be the next Dread Pirate Roberts better be able to handle the stress. I didn't like it." </body>

      <title>Nike and the battle for your wrist</title>
      <description>Can fitness trackers change your behaviour?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24543910</url>

      <body>Nike says its new activity-tracking Fuelband SE will motivate people to exercise even more. But can a wristband really lead to better health? Back in 2009, Nike vice-president of digital sport Stefan Olander and his team had an idea: what if a person could track how much they've moved in a day, just by glancing at their wrist? And so, the Nike Fuelband was born. Released in 2012, in a simple, sleek, black plastic design that flashed from red to green once a person's daily fitness goal had been met, the first Fuelband sold out in hours. The pitch was this: by wearing a Fuelband and monitoring fitness data via an app or on the web, anyone - from a professional athlete to Mr Olander himself - could work out a better, more effective, path to health. "In today's society, we are overwhelmed with complexity," says Mr Olander. With the Fuelband, he says, Nike really tries "to filter out what doesn't matter and just give you what you need in order to stay motivated." So what's different this time around? Nike says that in addition to making physical improvements to the latest Fuelband - better waterproofing, stainless steel screws - it has also analysed the data from the first wave of Fuelband adopters to see ways in which the band and its supporting iOS app and website could be improved. They found that 98% of their 20 million users exercised - but they didn't necessarily consistently move the recommended five minutes every hour. Now, the wristband buzzes to alert its wearer if he or she hasn't got up in a while. But Nike is not the only company experimenting with wearable technology - particularly as estimates about the potential growth in the industry range from $10bn to $50bn (£6bn to £31bn) in the next five years. Competitor Fitbit recently released a new model, and Jawbone, iHealth, Garmin, Withings and Adidas are among other firms to offer dedicated fitness-measuring gadgets. Samsung and Sony recently released a smartwatch that can monitor a user's steps, and even Apple - whose boss, Tim Cook, sits on Nike's board of directors - has expressed an interest in a device. But beyond these gadgets, Nike's main competition might not be a rival band, but the smartphone. "Smartphones are going to start doing more of the tracking, and more people have them already and don't have to buy separate devices," says Sara Watson, a fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Already, there is a spate of apps - from MyMee to MapMyRun - capitalising on these built-in features. Beyond the competition, there is also the basic question: can wearing a wristband really make you healthier? "The notion of tracking itself has been around a long time - this is not something new," says Michael Kim, a former Microsoft Xbox executive who is now the head of Kairos Labs. "The problem is tracking does not create new behaviour change - it tracks what you already do as a behaviour," says Mr Kim, whose firm works to help people cement their habits. But some doctors say the bands can help those who are already interested in exercise better tailor their workouts. "We have done a number of athletic performance tracking projects with people," says Dr Paul Abramson, a physician in San Francisco who uses tracking technologies in his practice. "Things like the Fuelband or more complex versions of them can be very useful for people who want to exercise more." Companies are also showing an interest in tracking sensors. In 2008 Bank of America equipped dozens of its call centre staff with special badges to study the way they interacted with each other as part of efforts to boost productivity. One technology consultant suggested several firms were now interested in using fitness equipment as a way of encouraging their staff to bond. "At a symposium event last week I was talking to a couple of companies that were trying to improve employee engagement, and there's some thinking that not only are healthier employees more productive but that their sharing of information about how much they are walking, how much they are riding etc is becoming the new 'water cooler' moment," says Mike Gotta from Gartner. However, he cautions that managers should resist the temptation to see the gadgets as the human equivalent of the black boxes used by some car insurance companies to track driver behaviour. "A few months back one firm made the news for saying: 'If you don't meet certain criteria we're going to charge you more per month for your healthcare.' That kind of behaviour could create a backlash," Mr Gotta warns. "But if firms give these analytics to the employees for their own self-improvement and are relatively hands-off, then the workers will share the information themselves and that could create better relationships across teams." Experts also note that gadgets like the Fuelband still have plenty of room for improvement. At present the measurements it captures are not always precise. Rivals are attempting to address this by offering a wider range of sensors. Withings, for example, has built a heart-rate monitor into its Pulse tracker; Polar's Loop carries out a similar trick by connecting its wristband to a separate accessory; Fitbit includes an altimeter in its new Force wristband to count the number of stairs climbed; while Motorola's Motoactv can be linked up with bicycle-fitted sensors that measure how fast the equipment is being pedalled and its speed of travel. Sensors that measure skin temperature, perspiration and the electrical activity produced by muscles offer further opportunities. "The fitness space has spawned a whole host of explorations of tracking devices in other areas," says Steve Dean, a partner at Prehype and a founder of the Quantified Self group in New York, which meets to discuss personal data tracking projects and technologies. "It's almost like there's an endless amount of things that we can instrument on our body." </body>

      <body>People around the world are building their own drones. They offer a glimpse of what life will be like when the skies are filled with small, flying robots - and drones become as common as smartphones. Raphael Pirker was sitting on a bench at Washington Square Park on a blustery Friday in New York. A small drone called Discovery, a remotely controlled aircraft made by his company, TBS Avionics, was on the bench next to him. Nearby another drone was flying near a fountain. Even before he saw the drone, he heard it. "It's just like this, 'bzz-bzz'," he said. An onlooker watched the aircraft - "a beginner drone", Pirker said, crash into the pavement. Down the block hundreds of people had gathered at New York University for a Drones and Aerial Robotics Conference. Like Pirker, many of them were carrying their own drones. On a global scale the US and Israel are the world's biggest manufacturers of drones. Yet some European officials want to change the dynamic. Michel Barnier, a European Union commissioner, told a group of French journalists in July that Europeans should make their own drones, rather than rely exclusively on US- and Israeli-made ones. Pirker is also planning for the future. In Europe drones are used to make movies (see Smurfs 2). In the UK officials have granted permission to more than 130 companies and government agencies to fly drones, according to an Aerospace America report. In the US the Federal Aviation Administration has approved the use of drones for police and government agencies, issuing about 1,400 permits over the past several years. The civilian air space will reportedly be open to all kinds of drones in Europe by 2016 - and in the US by 2015. Many of these machines will be small - like the ones Pirker makes. And cheap. You can make a drone, explained South-African-born Mike Winn, of Drone Deploy, for $500 (£310). Pirker, 29, is a Swiss-Austrian who lives in Hong Kong - "for business reasons". He wears rimless glasses, the kind once worn by Apple guru Steve Jobs, and he has light blue eyes. Pirker and the others at the conference belong to a new breed of drone maker. Many are global travellers, and most grew up on drones. At the conference 14-year-old Riley Morgan approached Pirker, carrying a drone he had made. Another enthusiast, Russell de la Torre, who is 31, made his first robot, "a remote-controlled truck with cardboard boxes", at age 12. Pirker started building model airplanes when he was six. "I got bored because they were just flying circles around," he said, spinning his hand in the air in a lazy manner. As an adult he said: "I had this crazy idea of flying [a drone] over the Statue of Liberty. "Everybody said, 'Don't do that - you're doing to get shot.'" "It was a strange feeling," he said, describing the day three years ago when the drone flew, as shown in this head-spinning footage. "It felt a little bit eerie because you're flying past so much history, you know, about America." Drones give one a different perspective. "It's not the plane that turns in the air - it's the world that turns," he said. Drones do more than provide material for trippy videos, though. They help farmers check on crops and allow journalists to report stories. But even small drones - like the kind Pirker makes - cause problems. "Every country has different rules, but we follow our own," Pirker said. "We're not going to hurt anybody. We do it with a little bit of play." Not everyone sees his drones as whimsical. Federal Aviation Administration officials tried to fine Pirker $10,000 for operating a drone in Charlottesville, Virginia, in October 2011. His lawyer filed a motion three weeks ago, describing the aircraft, a "five-pound radio-controlled model airplane constructed of styrofoam", as harmless. Small drones are usually benign. Yet they can be lethal. Roman Pirozek, 19, died last month in Brooklyn, NY, when his remote-controlled helicopter spun out of control - and hit him in the head. Small drones also provide new ways to spy. A Seattle woman felt uneasy about a drone outside her window, as she reported earlier this year on a blog. Amie Stepanovich, director of a project on domestic surveillance at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, thinks drones are cool - and said Pirker's video was "gorgeous". But drones also worry her. "They are helping to usher in a new age of physical surveillance," she said. "They provide a platform for some of the most invasive surveillance technologies we've ever seen." Pirker has a different perspective. Rather than causing anxiety, drones have helped him get over his fear of heights - a handicap, since he lives in a high-rise in Tseung Kwan O, outside of Hong Kong, on the 40th floor. As he sat on the park bench in New York, he stuck out his leg and jiggled it, showing what used to happen when he looked down from a window in a tall building. Now he said: "I just step back." </body>

      <title>Supercell: Europe’s supercharged games success</title>
      <description>Clash of Clans games developer Supercell's $1.5bn deal</description>

      <body>It is a Finnish company started in 2010, whose first products only emerged in 2011. You've probably never heard of Supercell, but on Tuesday it was valued at $3bn, making it the fastest growing technology firm to come out of Europe in, well, just about ever. Supercell is a games business with just two titles, Clash of Clans and Hay Day, which until last week could only be played on Apple's iPhone and iPad. But they have grabbed a huge share of the mobile gaming market, leading the world in terms of revenue, ahead of giants like EA which has 829 titles to Supercell's two. On Tuesday Japan's Softbank paid $1.5bn to acquire a 51% stake in Supercell. The telecoms firm is doing the deal in conjunction with its own gaming subsidiary GungHo, another major player in the new world of mobile games. This might look like another of those dotcom deals, where a wealthy corporate giant pays over the odds for a business with big user numbers but no concrete business plan. But Supercell is making money hand over fist - revenues grew from $100m in 2012 to $179m in the first quarter of this year and are on course to hit $1bn for the whole year. Key to its success has been its ability to crack the Asian market, something many other games developers have tried and failed to do. It has already been working with GungHo and has now brought its games to Android, essential for any firm competing in China. It all looks like a great success for Finland, also home of the Angry Birds firm Rovio, and for the wider European technology scene. Supercell was backed by London-based venture capital firms including Index Ventures and Atomico. They bought in at a valuation of $770m back in February, so have made their investment back four times over in the space of six months - though existing investors will retain half of their stakes in the business. That means more money will now be available to invest in other start-ups, and even if Supercell is now controlled from Japan, Tuesday's news will be a great boost for the image of the European games industry. The UK firm behind the phenomenally successful Candy Crush Saga, King.com, is currently working on its stock market debut, while the Moshi Monsters business Mind Candy is also rumoured to be thinking of an IPO. Both may end up on New York's Nasdaq over the next year. What is slightly disappointing is that these companies seem to be looking outside Europe - to Asia or the US - when they are seeking the funding they need to progress to the next stage of their development. But European games developers are showing that they have mastered what consumers want in the mobile world and using their skills to build big businesses in a hurry. </body>

      <body>The social news site Buzzfeed is growing at a scary rate, racing past serious news services like the New York Times - and the BBC - as the way younger people hear about what's happening around the world. It's even announced that it will be launching French, Spanish and Portuguese editions, using students and a language teaching platform called Duolingo to translate stories. So, in the spirit of a Buzzfeed list here are seven reasons why we should love/hate it: With 85 million visitors in August, it is fast becoming one of the most popular sites on the web. And look at where more than a billion Facebook users get their news - Buzzfeed is top of the list when it comes to stories shared by users, ahead of the Huffington Post, CNN and the BBC. And as the founder Jonah Peretti put it in a memo to staff, it's reaching an important audience: "The world needs sustainable, profitable, vibrant content companies staffed by dedicated professionals; especially content for people that grew up on the web, whose entertainment and news interests are largely neglected by television and newspapers." "This Baby Elephant Being Reunited With His Dad is The Cutest Thing You'll See Today" and "9 celebrity tweets you missed today" - if that is the future of journalism, heaven help us all… Some other Buzzfeed headlines today: "The Big Winner in JP Morgan's Earnings - lawyers", "Why These Three Economists Won The Nobel Prize", and "Blackberry's Last Ditch Attempt To Win You Over is Pretty Hilarious". There's business, technology and politics on Buzzfeed, and it's recruiting some serious journalist talent in the US and in London. When I met Jonah Peretti earlier this year and suggested that the cute and silly stuff was just part of a long term plan to fund serious investigative journalism he laughed. "You don't get it," he said. "We love the funny stories - it's what we're about." And some of the daft stuff is brilliantly done. Look at "The 29 Stages of A Twitterstorm." But serious or silly, it is all about clicks - any Buzzfeed writers who can't build an audience for their stories will soon be heading for the exit. The hardest trick in the modern media is making online news profitable - just ask anyone from The Guardian to The Sun. But as well as employing more than 400 people - technologists, journalists, marketing types - Buzzfeed is, according to Jonah Peretti, now making money. It was "accidentally" profitable once before in 2011, and then spent lots on expansion. Now it looks well placed to become a media powerhouse and without loads of intrusive advertising… Buzzfeed's clever trick is to teach advertisers to write Buzzfeed-like stories which promote their brands without in-your-face messages. On this morning's Today programme Jonah Peretti insisted that there was a clear division between "church and state", advertising and content. That may not be anything like as clear to Buzzfeed readers who click on "13 Signs You're Addicted To Fashion Blogs" without noticing that is sponsored by Blackberry UK. Mind you, whether that does any good to Blackberry is another matter entirely… 7. And here's a cute picture of a dog with a bandaged paw….. Well, if you can't beat them….. </body>

      <description>Why the world’s technology giants are investing in Africa</description>

      <body>"I don't understand. Why is it that the media only seems to talk about Africa when bad things happen?" The man behind the counter at my hotel in the Ghanaian capital, Accra, was talking to me about my job, and why I was visiting. He looked genuinely pained. He told me he is a big fan of the BBC - in west Africa the World Service and language services have a big following - but it seemed to him that the media outside the continent often only noticed when bad things happened. It's arguably a fair point. That's not to say the positive stories don't get reported, but he can be forgiven for seeing the headlines and thinking all the world sees is war, famine and pestilence. In fact, Africa is booming, with growth of 5.6% predicted for 2013, according to the World Bank - although research suggests this has yet to trickle down to the very poorest on the continent. The middle class in sub-Saharan Africa is expanding rapidly. With the seemingly unstoppable growth of the mobile phone, greater access to the internet, and an increase in access to education, change is happening, and more people have more disposable income to spend. So it's no surprise that the big technology companies are investing in Africa. But is this the whole story? Is it driven by philanthropy or a desire to get in on the ground before their competitors? Or does Africa offer other opportunities? I spoke to three tech giants about why they were investing in the continent. The company has bolstered existing investments in the continent by opening a research facility in Nairobi, with the official inauguration celebration happening at the end of October. According to IBM, this is the first research facility that does both applied and exploratory research on the continent. "The key thing is… the great growth story of Africa," says Dr Kamal Bhattacharya, the director of IBM Research - Africa. "We know that financial inclusion is the big challenge. About 80% of the population has no access to financial services. There is the lack of access to energy, safe water, sanitation, food security. "As scientists we believe that science and technology is an enabler to express your needs, it is an enabler to shape your own future. "And this is why IBM is making this very significant investment into Africa, starting with Kenya. We've hired some of the top talent from all over the world, the African diaspora, people of African origin, also people who contribute to the growth of Africa, and we bring them all together here. "We believe research for Africa, solving Africa's grand challenges, has to be done on the ground in Africa and this is why we set up and made this investment." His colleague, Dr Uyi Stewart, is chief scientist at the lab. Originally from Nigeria, the role has brought him and his family back to the continent after nearly 10 years in New York. "People ask us: 'Can you do African research from New York?' Yes you can. It is possible, you can do research from anywhere. "But you will miss the mark... In order to capture value, and deliver innovation that leads to commercially viable products that impact people's lives, we have to be here, in the local ecosystem." Fernando de Sousa heads Microsoft's 4Afrika initiative, which focuses on encouraging innovation, increasing access to technology and building skills in the local workforce. The division backs projects across the continent including access to training, roll-out of broadband in rural areas, infrastructure, agriculture and healthcare projects, as well as their App Factories, hubs designed to nurture young developers creating apps for the Windows phone platform. Building these projects has a very personal resonance for Mr de Sousa, who was born in Mozambique and ended up spending time in a South African refugee camp as a child after the outbreak of civil war. "We said we want on focus on young people. We want to focus on skills, we want to focus on small and medium enterprises. We want to focus on access to technology. "Let's take Kenya - so we start with TV white spaces in a village in the Maasai Mara. "It's now evolved into a national policy conversation - President Kenyatta has said he wants 1.3 million students to have a [connected] device by September 2013. And he travelled to the Masai Mara to go and see what we're doing. "It's not just about networks, it's not just about PCs. It's about the end economic impact, it's about the skills. "[Now] we have 11 countries that have formally submitted requests for us to implement TV white spaces technology." But Mr de Sousa is clear about the motivation behind the initiative. "There is a corporate social investment part of Microsoft which has nothing to do with Microsoft 4Afrika. And I think that that is a well-established process, we do a lot of donations in that space. "This is about being on the ground and creating huge consumers. There's no debate about the fact that our objective is enabling economic development. "In proving the value of technology as the enabler for that development, it's not just creating consumption of technology, but it's actually more importantly creating the ability for knowledge to be developed, for technology to actually be built in Africa. "Because that actually drives the IT ecosystem, that drives the IT industry, that makes technology relevant." Isabel Kelly is the international director of the Salesforce.com Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the customer relationship management and services technology giant. She joined the company 11 years ago from campaigning group Amnesty International. The Foundation was started with an initial investment from the company, as well as access to Salesforce.com software, which is licensed to non-profits, and staff members volunteering. The first project in Africa for the Foundation was the suggestion of an employee, who had a brother who was volunteering in a school in the Kibagare slum in Nairobi. "We gave some refurbished hardware to them, we paid for them to get the internet," Ms Kelly says. "And so the school has taken on a bit of a focus on technology, we sponsored about 40 girls through the school, over the 10 years." One of the sponsored pupils from a particularly difficult background would go on to become a lawyer working for the Kenyan Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission. The Foundation has its own revenue stream from the bigger NGOs it works with (customers include the Grameen Foundation) and also funds training in how to use the Salesforce platform, and workshops for start-ups at places like Nairobi's iHub and mLab. Meanwhile, a host of social enterprises are using Salesforce tech to power their organisations - like Juhudi Kilimo, a micro-finance social enterprise, focusing on small, rural farmers in Kenya, and Honeycare, an organisation that helps farmers turn to honey production. </body>

      <title>The strange life of John McAfee</title>
      <description>The very strange life of millionaire John McAfee</description>

      <body>Who is the real John McAfee? He's the man who went on the run after his neighbour was found dead, face-up, with a bullet in his head. He's the man who jump-started the multibillion-dollar anti-virus industry. And now he thinks he can make you invisible on the internet. Within tech circles he's long been a legend. But for most people, McAfee came to prominence last year when he fled his Central American home - teeth stained, hair dyed, in disguise - rather than let himself be questioned by authorities he accused of being corrupt. He tells the BBC he had "no connection whatsoever" with his neighbour's death. Police say he remains a "person of interest". Back in the US, after posting footage of young female "friends" stroking his naked tattooed torso, he now plans to neutralise the NSA's cyber-surveillance system. It might suggest a crazed, perhaps even deranged, personality. One journalist who has interviewed McAfee many times described him a "master manipulator" who lies and deceives. "I've been called paranoid, schizophrenic, the wild child of Silicon Valley," McAfee acknowledges. But he has a different perspective: "I'm an entrepreneur. I always have been. I am curious and I enjoy solving problems. "I think that it's when we step out of the road, step outside the box, become our own person and we walk fearlessly down paths other people wouldn't look at, that true progress comes. And sometimes true beauty as well. "We're missing that. We're missing the people who have the courage to walk into the wilderness just to see what's there." This is how Amy Emshwiller, the teenage ex-prostitute he lived with in Belize, describes him: "He's sweet, generous. He likes to like adventures. He's serious and usually he has a dark sense of humour. He's generally a sweet guy. He just doesn't like to be [expletive] with." So, who is the real John McAfee? To have any chance of knowing and gaining an informed opinion of what really motivated his erratic-sounding behaviour after the killing of Gregory Faull, you must travel deep into the 68-year-old's past. Despite his Southern accent, the bleached-blond and goateed businessman is in fact half-British - the son of an Englishwoman who met an American soldier stationed in the UK during World War II. "I feel as much British as I do American," McAfee says. "There's not much difference between our countries." They moved to Virginia when he was young, where he had a troubled childhood. His father was an abusive alcoholic who, when McAfee was aged 15, shot himself dead. In the following years, McAfee says, he too began drinking heavily and taking drugs, but still managed to maintain a promising academic career. That came to an end in the late 1960s when Northeast State Louisiana State College terminated his PhD in mathematics after it was revealed that he had slept with an undergraduate he was mentoring. They later married and McAfee turned his skills to a series of programming jobs with some of the biggest tech organisations of the time including Nasa, General Electric, Siemens, Univac and Xerox, all the while continuing to indulge in his addictions. "Most of my bosses also used drugs of some kind," he says. "I was in the tech field, after all, we were the leading edge in technology and the leading age in personal experimentation. "I had to hide it from my mother and sometimes from my wife. But in the work environment - depending on where you worked - in some companies drugs were taken openly at lunchtime in people's offices. It was a bizarre time." Matters came to a head in the early 1980s after his wife left him, his most recent employer, Omex, let him go and the scale of his drug dependency forced him to seek help. "It was 1984, the last time that I took drugs, drank alcohol or sold drugs for that matter," he says. "I simply stopped. I started going to an organisation called Alcoholics Anonymous... and that was my last taste of that world. "However, it is still with me. My body is covered with tattoos from that period. And I'm afraid some of my ideas and concepts and attitudes that were moulded during that time are still with me. That's why people think, perhaps, I'm a little bit off the wall." Despite his troubles, McAfee managed to land a job at defence contractor Lockheed Martin, where he worked on a classified voice-recognition program. There he came across an unusual bit of self-replicating code designed to copy itself on to any floppy disk inserted into affected computers. When examined, it contained the message: "Welcome to the dungeon. Beware of this VIRUS." "When I first read about the Pakistani Brain virus, I'd never heard of a virus before, neither had anyone in technology," remembers McAfee. "It fascinated me." He worked out a way to disinfect the computers and then spread the cure via the bulletin board system, a precursor to the web. The challenge inspired him to set up a business of his own: McAfee Associates - a firm that would later be sold, years after he had left, to Intel for more than $7.6bn (£4.7bn). "I knew the field would become extremely large because people being who they are, there will always be hackers," he says. "It's why we have graffiti on the walls of the inner city. People like to deface things. They like to disrupt things. "So, given that fact, computer viruses were not going to go away and were only going to get worse. I just did what I could to be at the forefront of that industry for as long as I could." Despite this, he says, he has never himself used any of the products made by the firm that continues to bear his name. "I'm constantly under attack, yet I use no software protection. "I protect myself by constantly changing my IP [internet protocol] address, by not attaching my name to any device I use, and by not going on to sites where you might pick up a virus. "Porn sites, for example, I just don't go there. "Secondly, I practise safe computing. If someone sends me an email with a link, I'm not going there until I can call the person to verify that they sent me the email. "It sounds absurd to live that way, but I would rather trust my own devices and thoughts than someone else's software." After selling his stake in the business in 1994, McAfee went on to found and sell other companies, including an instant messaging system, a firewall provider and a ranch from which he offered flights in "trikes" - low-flying, engine-powered cabins suspended from hang-gliders. Then he headed south. In 2008, at an age others might be thinking of putting up their feet, McAfee moved to the jungle of Belize with the stated intention of trying to cure another kind of infection. "I came across a concept called quorum sensing, which is the technique that bacteria use to communicate with each other. "Up until about 10 years ago we didn't even know that bacteria did communicate, but we find out they have a very sophisticated communication system. I wanted to explore and investigate that to see if we could come up with new antibiotics." He picked the area, he says, because the plants that grew along the country's Rio Nuevo river contained compounds that inhibit bacteria from sending chemical signals to each other and thus thwart their ability to co-ordinate an attack. Things didn't go as planned. The first sign of trouble was when journalists invited to his Carmelita, Orange Walk, base wrote stories that made clear they did not know what to make of the operation. Then a falling-out with the microbiologist he was working with, Allison Adonizio, put the project at risk when she quit. Dr Adonizio, who is now based in Philadelphia, did not want to be interviewed. In April 2012, matters came to a head when the Belize police force's Gang Suppression Unit raided the research facility. McAfee says the officers claimed they suspected it was being used to make the illegal psycho-stimulant methamphetamine. They shot his dog, he says, confiscated both his passport and licensed weapons on the property, and briefly imprisoned him before dropping the charges. "Under no circumstances did they really believe it was a meth lab," he states. "Everybody knew it was a biotech lab because I had hired half of the people in the village to work there. They all knew what I was doing. "It's a pirate haven. It's an extremely corrupt and dangerous place. "I knew this and my friends all advised me against it. I just thought I was smart enough to sidestep it. Unfortunately, I was not. "I was there for a year and the local politician sent a representative and asked for $2m for a campaign donation. I said no. Two weeks later they raided my compound." McAfee says when he was asked a second time for the cash he went on a publicity blitz, posting messages online, and speaking to local and international press about the incident. It became political. The Belize Times - published by the leading opposition party - suggested the "barbaric assault" on McAfee was a "global black eye" for the nation and a threat to its tourist industry. "I do wish that I were smarter socially," reflects McAfee. "I think I have the ability to solve mathematical equations and programming issues very easily, but I am a little bit naive in some social situations. And certainly in Belize I was way naive." At the time of the raid, McAfee had begun an affair with a 16-year-old ex-prostitute he had met on Belize Independence Day. "I was partying, I was drinking, and I went into this bar and the owner said a friend wants to meet me and likes me," remembers Amy Emshwiller, who still lives in Belize. "[He said] can I have your number, and then two weeks later he called me." She says he was unaware she was less than a quarter of his age. "He didn't know how old I was. I lied to him saying I was 18, and he thought it was OK. "I let him fall in love first before I told him my age. "When I told him he was so [expletive] shocked that he didn't know what to do. He was baffled. And he was like: 'I still love you, I don't know what to do. I'm in love with a young girl.' That's how that happened." McAfee's long-term American girlfriend left him. And like many things in his life, the new affair proved complicated. One night Emshwiller took McAfee's gun. She aimed it at his head, squeezed her eyes shut and pulled the trigger. She missed. He continued the relationship. "Amy, for one - and many girls in Belize - has a horrific story of abuse that if I told you, you could not believe it," McAfee explains. "Of course she's not going to be well. Of course she's going to have issues. "When she tried to shoot me in the head what I saw was a frightened child. "What I saw was a confused girl who had been so abused - physically, sexually, emotionally - beyond any description. "What are you going to do? Throw her out? That doesn't help her. "All she did was burst my eardrum. I'm deaf in one ear now, but I don't have a bullet in my head. Forgiveness is one of the graces that we have as human beings. Can I be faulted for indulging in it?" Emshwiller confirms the event but says she wanted to scare, not kill, him after he had said he wanted another girl. She adds it was not the only such incident provoked by her jealousy. "One time before, I held him in the corner and I put a knife at his throat," she says. "And he just said: 'Go ahead. Kill me.' And I couldn't do it. I just dropped the knife and walked out." Following the raid, McAfee and Emshwiller moved to his villa at San Pedro - a town on Belize's biggest island, Ambergris Caye - where they agreed to have an open relationship. There they were visited by Chad Essley, a cartoonist, who began collaborating on a book about McAfee's life. "I didn't quite realise that his lifestyle would be this older guy surrounded by young girls and bodyguards with guns," he says. "Many of these girls were former prostitutes or had very rough lives. "It was expressly forbidden to go out in the town and drink - the smell of alcohol, he could not be around it. He didn't want any of the girls doing any drugs at all. "I interviewed each of these girls, got their background. They were incredibly sad. They were definitely in a better sort of situation being around John." Meanwhile next door, Gregory Faull, an Orlando sports bar owner who had recently divorced and decided to live in his Belize holiday home, was becoming increasingly irate at his neighbour's activities. On Thursday, 8 November 2012, McAfee made the local headlines when he donated 40 stun guns, handcuffs and batons to the local police at a press conference. Mayor Daniel Guerrero thanked him, stating: "Crime is affecting the tourism industry as we have been listed on travel advisories; it is time to stop this. Let us protect our industry and turn San Pedro into the safe haven once more." That night the local TV bulletin declared that "the hatchet was formally buried", suggesting the rift between McAfee and Belize's authorities had ended. Early on Sunday morning, Mr Faull was found dead in a pool of his blood by his housekeeper. Police called to the scene found a single 9mm shell nearby. They said a mobile phone and laptop were missing but there were no visible signs of a forced entry. The head of the police's Gang Suppression Unit told a local newspaper that his officers wanted to speak to McAfee as part of the investigation, but when they called at his house he did not appear to be in. An article posted the following day by Wired magazine revealed why. McAfee told the publication he had seen the officers approaching and had hidden in the sand of his property putting a cardboard box over his head. He recalls that his caretaker had told him of Mr Faull's murder, and now he feared for his own life. "The first thing that came to my mind was, 'Oh, my Lord. The government is finally trying to rid themselves of me,' he says. "The government does from time to time. "I had certainly been a huge thorn in their side, and they had simply got the wrong white man. "Seriously, this is what went through my mind. My friends sort of calmed me down, and later said that's absurd. At the time I did not think so." McAfee acknowledges that he and Mr Faull had been at odds, but plays down the idea they hated each other or that he suspected him of being the person who had fed two of Emshwiller's dogs a poisoned tortilla. "The entire five years I was there, I'd said maybe 15 words to him," he says. "He did not like my dogs and the past two occasions I had seen him walking on the beach he complained. But so did everybody. "There was no ongoing argument. Yeah, he was mad about my dogs. Maybe as I'm beginning to think now, maybe he was the one who poisoned them. At the time I certainly did not believe that." In fact, as ABC News later revealed, Mr Faull had filed a complaint to Mayor Guerrero about McAfee the previous month. It said McAfee's dog had attacked a tourist; that his security guards had "terrified" other residents by walking around with shotguns and shining lights in their eyes, and that taxis and other traffic had been arriving at his property "at all hours", causing a disturbance. "I did not find that out until weeks after I came back to the States," says McAfee when pressed about this. "Belize is not like America where you file a complaint and then the police come out and chase things out. You file a complaint and it goes into a drawer." McAfee then went on the run, saying he feared he would be "silenced" if he was caught and thrown in jail. It made headlines worldwide, in no small part due to the fact that he was posting updates to a blog and giving frequent interviews - actions he says were designed to ensure he couldn't be made to disappear if he had been caught. "I disguised myself as a ragged salesman," he recalls. "All it takes is some dirty clothes and not bathing for a few days and not combing my hair. "You know, people saw my photograph everywhere because all of the police and army had it for that month and a half I was underground. I just made sure I looked different than that." Questioned about the affair, Dean Barrow, Belize's prime minister, made it clear McAfee was not an official murder suspect, and had only been classed instead a "person of interest". "I don't want to be unkind to the gentleman, but I believe he is extremely paranoid, even bonkers," the politician added. During this time McAfee continued to see Emshwiller. "When he was on the run I went for lunches with him and then he would call and say: 'Come to this place, or go there,' she recalls. "How to come, when to come. Not to go out, or stay home, or go to a different location. He would tell me that so nobody would get me." She adds that she regrets she did not go with him when he finally decided to escape the country. The next major development came on 3 December when a reporter and photographer from Vice magazine revealed they were documenting McAfee's life on the run. In what proved a frustrating twist for the tech guru, they then unwittingly revealed he had crossed the border to Guatemala - a fact revealed by a photo uploaded to the Vice website by staff at its headquarters, who failed to wipe its location data. "I had gone out of my way to arrange the escape and I was breathing easily and looking forward to a few days of relaxation," remembers McAfee. "We immediately had to go on the run again because we were in Guatemala illegally at this point. But it was no-one's real fault. It was just the fault of the moment." A few days later McAfee was arrested. There was initially speculation he would be sent back to Belize, but a week later he was allowed to fly to Miami a free man. "After it was over I asked myself, 'Good Lord, I must have been afraid,'" he says. "But I really can't remember. I remember merely trying to solve the problems that occurred as they occurred." McAfee has offered a $25,000 bounty for information relating to Mr Faull's death, but says an attempt to contact the victim's family proved unsuccessful. The family has called the reward a "hollow gesture" and suggested if McAfee really wanted to help he would have met with the Belize police. A spokesman for the country's government said its authorities still wanted to speak to the businessman. "Mr McAfee's claims and his behaviour have been extreme," he told the BBC. "The investigation is ongoing and McAfee remains a person of interest. If McAfee were to respond to questioning it would make a difference to the progress of the investigation - but this is currently out of the hands of the government of Belize." So long as the crime remains unsolved, it is inevitable the entrepreneur will always face suspicion. But he says he can live with that. "There's always going to be someone who likes you and someone who dislikes you," he says. "Someone who thinks you're a hero and some that think you're a villain. You know I just do what I can in situations like this to continue to state that I'm totally innocent." That doesn't mean he is trying to forget his time in Belize. In addition to the graphic novel, he is working with a Canadian firm to make both a documentary and a movie about his time there. He adds that George Jung - the imprisoned cocaine drugs lord portrayed by Johnny Depp in the film Blow - has been picked to write his biography. While those projects brew, McAfee has returned to Silicon Valley, announcing the forthcoming launch of a $100 gadget that he promises can make you invisible on the net. "If you cannot see it, you cannot hack it, you cannot look at it, you cannot spy on anything happening inside it," he explains. He says the D-Central units will fit in people's pockets and allow their phones, tablets and PCs to communicate with other owners' devices within a three-block radius. He adds they can also connect to the net anonymously via a node - a separate piece of equipment attached to the network - either directly or with their encrypted data relayed relayed via other D-Central boxes. Each will frequently change their network identifier - a long number used by devices as an ID - making them hard to track, he explains. He suggests it will appeal to college students who want to copy music anonymously and to businesses wanting to prevent the theft of corporate secrets. He's also well aware that in the light of Edward Snowden's leaks about surveillance techniques used by the US and UK governments, part of the appeal will be thwarting their efforts. "You know from their own paranoia and desire to stay in power, they are watching everything they can," he says. Will the tech work? Will he really frustrate the authorities once again? At this point, like so much of John McAfee's life, it's impossible to be sure of all the facts and it's ultimately up to you whether you take him at his word. </body>

      <title>Sleep 'cleans' the brain of toxins</title>
      <description>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins of a hard day's thinking, US researchers have demonstrated.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24567412</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70542000/jpg/_70542753_c0177393-brain_scan%2C_conceptual_image-spl.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking, researchers have shown. The US team believe the "waste removal system" is one of the fundamental reasons for sleep. Their study, in the journal Science, showed brain cells shrink during sleep to open up the gaps between neurons and allow fluid to wash the brain clean. They also suggest that failing to clear away some toxic proteins may play a role in brain disorders. One big question for sleep researchers is why do animals sleep at all when it leaves them vulnerable to predators? It has been shown to have a big role in the fixing of memories in the brain and learning, but a team at the University of Rochester Medical Centre believe that "housework" may be one of the primary reasons for sleep. "The brain only has limited energy at its disposal and it appears that it must choose between two different functional states - awake and aware or asleep and cleaning up," said researcher Dr Maiken Nedergaard. "You can think of it like having a house party. You can either entertain the guests or clean up the house, but you can't really do both at the same time." Their findings build on last year's discovery of the brain's own network of plumbing pipes - known as the glymphatic system - which carry waste material out of the brain. Scientists, who imaged the brains of mice, showed that the glymphatic system became 10-times more active when the mice were asleep. Cells in the brain, probably the glial cells which keep nerve cells alive, shrink during sleep. This increases the size of the interstitial space, the gaps between brain tissue, allowing more fluid to be pumped in and wash the toxins away. Dr Nedergaard said this was a "vital" function for staying alive, but did not appear to be possible while the mind was awake. She told the BBC: "This is purely speculation, but it looks like the brain is losing a lot of energy when pumping water across the brain and that is probably incompatible with processing information." She added that the true significance of the findings would be known only after human studies, but doing similar experiments in an MRI machine would be relatively easy. Commenting on the research Dr Neil Stanley, an independent sleep expert, said: "This is a very interesting study that shows sleep is essential downtime to do some housekeeping to flush out neurotoxins. "There is good data on memory and learning, the psychological reason for sleep. But this is the actual physical and chemical reason for sleep, something is happening which is important." Dr Raphaelle Winsky-Sommerer, a lecturer in sleep at Surrey University, said: "It's not surprising, our whole physiology is changing during sleep. "The novelty is the role of the interstitial space, but I think it's an added piece of the puzzle not the whole mechanism. "The significance is that, yet again, it shows sleep may contribute to the restoration of brain cell function and may have protective effects." Many conditions which lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease are characterised by the build-up of damaged proteins in the brain. The researchers suggest that problems with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to such diseases, but caution more research is needed. The charity Alzheimer's Research UK said more research would be needed to see whether damage to the brain's waste clearance system could lead to diseases like dementia, but the findings offered a "potential new avenue for investigation". </body>

      <title>Hunt highlights plight of the lonely</title>

      <body>It is a source of "national shame" that as many as 800,000 people in England are "chronically lonely", Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. In a speech, Mr Hunt highlighted the "problem of loneliness that in our busy lives we have utterly failed to confront as a society". "Some five million people say television is their main form of company," he said. Labour accused of him trying to blame families for government failures. In a speech at the National Children and Adults Services (NCAS) conference, Mr Hunt said: "Each and every lonely person has someone who could visit them and offer companionship. "A forgotten million who live amongst us - ignored to our national shame." He added: "According to the Campaign to End Loneliness, there are 800,000 people in England who are chronically lonely." He also told delegates that the 112,000 cases of alleged abuse in care homes referred by English councils in 2012-13, the majority involving over-65s, indicated that "something is badly wrong". But the regulation of care in both the private and public sector was improving, he argued. The Conservative MP said the new chief inspector of social care, Andrea Sutcliffe, would start to give ratings to care homes from April 2014, with a view to organising inspections of all 25,000 care homes by 2016. Mr Hunt said he was "particularly worried" about the 400,000 people in care homes - some of whom get regular visits, but others who were just "parked there". He said that 46% of people aged 80 or over reported feeling lonely "some of the time or often". He warned that loneliness was as "bad for you" as "smoking 15 cigarettes a day", was "worse than obesity" because of the risk of blood clots, heart disease and dementia, and warned that lonely people "drink more" and are more prone to early admission in residential or nursing care. Mr Hunt also said he believed the UK should learn from Asian cultures, where there was "reverence and respect for older people" and "residential care is a last rather than a first option". "The social contract is stronger because as children see how their own grandparents are looked after, they develop higher expectations of how they too will be treated when they get old," he explained. "If we are to tackle the challenge of an ageing society, we must learn from this - and restore and reinvigorate the social contract between generations. "And uncomfortable though it is to say it, it will only start with changes in the way we personally treat our own parents and grandparents." England should aim to become "the best place in the world to grow old in", he concluded. But Labour said the "real national shame" was "Jeremy Hunt's attempt to shift the blame for dealing with the very real problems of loneliness amongst elderly people on to families alone". Shadow health and social care minister Liz Kendall said: "He seems completely unaware that there are over six million unpaid family carers in Britain today, one in five of whom provide more than 50 hours care a week for their loved ones. "These unsung heroes save the taxpayer billions of pounds yet often get precious little support in return. "Families, friends and neighbours need a decent care system to back up their efforts to look after elderly people, but the reality is our care system is in crisis and has been pushed to the brink of collapse. "Jeremy Hunt and David Cameron need to take responsibly for their government's actions rather than trying to turn the clock back and say it's down to families alone." Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said on Twitter that Jeremy Hunt was "right to highlight isolation of older people". He added: "But he can't get away from fact that Govt cuts to care have made it much worse." But speaking on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Anthea Tinker, professor of social gerontology at King's College in London, said it was a "myth" that eastern Asian families placed greater reverence on families and older people than in the West. "The reality is that with one-child-families, children have often moved to a city or emigrated," she said. "So it's just not practical for families to depend on their children. One of the largest nursing homes in the world is about to open in China, for 5,000 people, which is amazing." Prof Tinker added: "We've got to look at the reality rather than the myth." </body>

      <title>Housework 'not strenuous enough'</title>
      <description>Housework and DIY are not strenuous enough to count towards people's activity targets, a paper has found.</description>

      <body>Housework and DIY are not strenuous enough to count towards people's activity targets, a paper has found. It had been thought they could count towards the recommended 150 minutes of moderately intense activity per week. But the BMC Public Health study, which surveyed over 4,500 adults, found those who counted housework were heavier than those who did other activities. Experts said activities only counted when they made breathing more rapid and the heart beat faster. NHS recommendations do say housework does not count towards the 150-minute goal. But the researchers in this paper say there has been a move towards promoting a "lifestyle approach" to physical activity - encouraging "domestic" activities in people who may not take part in sports or go to the gym. And they warn that, while any activity is better than none, people should be aware that they still need to meet the moderate activity target on top. Participants completed a detailed interview about their activity levels, whether they played any sports or did formal exercise as well as their diet and smoking and drinking habits. They were particularly asked about activity linked to looking after their homes. Domestic housework in 10 minute bursts or more accounted for 36% of the reported moderate to vigorous physical activity people said they did. But when weight and height were taken into account, researchers found that those who counted housework as exercise were heavier than people doing other exercise for the same amount of time. Among women, just a fifth reached the weekly exercise target if housework was discounted. The research team, which included experts from the Universities of Ulster, Sheffield Hallam and Wolverhampton as well as Sport Northern Ireland concluded: "Domestic physical activity accounts for a significant proportion of self-reported daily moderate to vigorous physical activity particularly among females and older adults. "However such activity is negatively associated with leanness, suggesting that such activity may not be sufficient to provide all of the benefits normally associated with meeting the physical activity guidelines." Prof Marie Murphy, from the University of Ulster, who led the study, said: "Housework is physical activity and any physical activity should theoretically increase the amount of calories expended. "But we found that housework was inversely related to leanness, which suggests that either people are overestimating the amount of moderate intensity physical activity they do through housework, or are eating too much to compensate for the amount of activity undertaken." She added: "When talking to people about the amount of physical activity they need to stay healthy, it needs to be made clear that housework may not be intense enough to contribute to the weekly target and that other more intense activities also need to be included each week." Chris Allen, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: "Your exercise should make you breathe harder, feel warmer, and make your heart beat faster than usual. "So, unless your household chores tick all these boxes, they won't count. "If you're daunted by the prospect of a 150-minute target, think of it in 10-minute chunks. "It doesn't necessarily mean forking out for a gym membership either - try a brisk walk on your lunch break or make a resolution to take the stairs rather than the lift each morning." </body>

      <title>Talking therapy 'eases hypochondria'</title>
      <description>Cognitive behavioural therapy is more effective than standard care for people who have health anxiety or hypochondria, say researchers writing in The Lancet.</description>

      <body>Cognitive behavioural therapy is more effective than standard care for people with hypochondria or health anxiety, say researchers writing in The Lancet. In their study, 14% of patients given CBT regained normal anxiety levels against 7% given the usual care of basic reassurance. It said nurses could easily be trained to offer the psychological therapy. Between 10% and 20% of hospital patients are thought to worry obsessively about their health. Previous studies have shown that CBT, which aims to change thought patterns and behaviour, is an effective treatment for other anxiety disorders. But there is a shortage of specialists trained to deliver CBT, and as a result waiting lists can be long. In this study, 219 people with health anxiety received an average of six sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy while 225 received reassurance and support, which is standard. After periods of six months and 12 months, patients in the CBT group showed "significantly greater improvement in self-rated anxiety and depression symptoms" compared with standard care, the study showed. There was also a particularly noticeable reduction in health anxiety in the CBT group straight after treatment began. The therapy was delivered by non-CBT experts who had been trained in only two workshops. Study author Prof Peter Tyrer, head of the Centre for Mental Health at Imperial College London, said the results showed that hypochondria could be successfully treated, in a "relatively cheap" way, by general nurses with minimal training in a hospital setting. Reducing the anxiety levels of 14% of the CBT group might not seem a high figure, he said, but these were often people with serious problems who had sometimes spent thousands of pounds on private health assessments because of fears about their health. "Health anxiety is costly for healthcare providers and an effective treatment could potentially save money by reducing the need for unnecessary tests and emergency hospital admissions," Prof Tyrer said. Writing about the study in The Lancet, Chris Williams from the University of Glasgow and Allan House from the University of Leeds, said the findings were "intriguing" but translating them into services was "problematic". They also questioned the cost-effectiveness of screening patients for health anxiety and CBT. They wrote: "Health anxiety is only one of the problems noted in medical outpatients - depression, hazardous alcohol use, poor treatment adherence, and other forms of medically unexplained presentation all press for recognition and intervention. "To develop multiple parallel services makes no sense, especially since the common emotional disorders overlap substantially." But Prof Tyrer said health anxiety was a hidden epidemic that required the correct treatment, not just reassurance. </body>

      <title>Poverty gap 'causing unjust deaths'</title>
      <description>The gap between rich and poor is leading to thousands of unnecessary deaths in Scotland, health experts say.</description>

      <body>The gap between rich and poor is leading to thousands of unnecessary deaths in Scotland, health experts say. NHS Health Scotland examined 30 years of health trends and found large differences in preventable causes of death across social groups. Director of Public Health Science Andrew Fraser said these patterns of death were not inevitable. NHS Health Scotland called for action to tackle inequality and not just the recognised causes of disease. The organisation's report noted that decreasing periods of health inequality had previously been observed in the UK, suggesting the situation could change. It said there was an urgent need for action to address inequalities in "income, resources and power" across society. The report showed that the gap in deaths across different social groups for specific causes decreased, while others emerged. It revealed that there was little difference in death rates from non-preventable diseases such as brain and ovarian cancer, but large differences in more preventable causes like alcohol-related deaths and heart disease. The common factor suggested for the persistence of health inequalities was social inequalities. Dr Gerry McCartney, head of the public health observatory at NHS Health Scotland, said: "Health inequalities represent thousands of unnecessary and unjust deaths per year across almost all social groups in Scotland. "The reason that health inequalities did not fall as particular causes were successfully tackled may be because individuals with more resources were able to protect themselves against new threats to health." Mr Fraser added: "We need a debate and action that helps us to agree answers to the question 'What would it take to eradicate health inequalities?'. "The answers lie in tackling the causes of inequalities, and not just the recognised causes of disease. "Patterns of death that are evident in this report are the end-points of circumstances that span Scottish life rather than focus on a particular disease group. Prevention is achievable, and inequalities are not inevitable. "We can anticipate that the burden of healthcare facing the NHS, communities and families will become progressively greater if we, as a country, don't provide the answers." </body>

      <title>Air pollution causes cancer - WHO</title>
      <description>Pollutants in the air we breathe have been classed as a major cause of cancer by the World Health Organization.</description>

      <body>Pollutants in the air we breathe have been classed as a leading environmental cause of cancer by the World Health Organization. It said the evidence was clear they cause lung cancer. Sources of pollution include car exhausts, power stations, emissions from agriculture and industry - as well as heating in people's homes. The WHO said the classification should act as a strong message to governments to take action. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a part of the WHO, has now classed air pollution in the same category as tobacco smoke, UV radiation and plutonium. It said air pollution had been know to cause heart and lung diseases, but evidence had now emerged that it was also causing cancer. The IARC said the most recent data suggested 223,000 deaths from lung cancer around the world were caused by air pollution. More than half of the deaths were thought to be in China and other East Asian countries. Rapid industrialisation has led to smoggy skies in cities such as Beijing. However, it is a global problem and concerns about air pollution were raised in Europe again this week. Data suggests there may also be a link with bladder cancer. Dr Kurt Straif, from IARC, said: "The air we breathe has become polluted with a mixture of cancer-causing substances. "We now know that outdoor air pollution is not only a major risk to health in general, but also a leading environmental cause of cancer deaths." Cancer Research UK said it was not a surprise. Dr Julie Sharp, the head of health information at the charity, said: "It's important that people keep the risk from air pollution in perspective. "Although air pollution increases the risk of developing lung cancer by a small amount, other things have a much bigger effect on our risk, particularly smoking." Dr Rachel Thompson, head of research interpretation at the World Cancer Research Fund International, said: "This latest evidence confirms the need for government, industry and multinational bodies to urgently address environmental causes of cancer. "But there's also a lot we can do as individuals to lower our chances of developing the disease such as being more physically active and adopting a healthier diet." </body>

      <title>Doctors told 'don't blame' obese</title>
      <description>Doctors treating obese or overweight patients should be "respectful" and "non-blaming", advice to the NHS says.</description>

      <body>Doctors treating obese or overweight patients should be "respectful" and "non-blaming", advice to the NHS says. The draft guidance is published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). It also suggests obese patients be referred to weight-loss programmes, including those run by commercial companies, to help them lose weight. Obesity increases the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes and costs the NHS more than £5bn each year. Just over a quarter of adults in England are classed as obese and a further 41% of men and 33% of women as overweight. The NICE document, which is subject to a three-month consultation, suggests all health professionals dealing with overweight or obese people should monitor their tone in order to "minimise harm". It states all healthcare professionals should "be aware of the effort needed to lose weight and avoid further weight gain and the stigma adults who are overweight or obese may feel or experience". It adds: "Ensure the tone and content of all communications or dialogue is respectful and non-blaming. "The terminology used to describe the person's condition should respect individual preferences." NHS care providers should also ensure equipment and facilities "meet the needs of most adults who are overweight or obese". Those overseeing NHS weight management programmes should tell patients how much weight they can "realistically" expect to lose, and that no programme is a "magic bullet", the document says. Instead, stress should be put on the "importance of making gradual, long-term changes to their eating habits and physical activity and how much weight they might realistically expect to lose in total and on a weekly basis if they adhere to the programme". Prof Mike Kelly, director of the Centre for Public Health at NICE, said: "Being overweight or obese can have serious consequences for an individual's health, not only physically with increased risk of high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, but it can also affect their mental health as a result of stigma and bullying or discrimination." He added: "This draft guidance isn't about quick fixes, it is about ensuring lifestyle weight management services support people in the long-term. "Programmes that address diet, activity and behaviour change can help people who are obese lose weight, but they are only cost-effective if the weight is kept off." Tam Fry, a spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, said most health professionals were not trained in how to raise weight issues effectively. "The abrupt style that many have taken so far has only made matters worse," he said. "NICE is correct to say they should be moderate in their tone. But once they've got the tone right and the confidence of the patient, they should really think about tough love. "It's essential that patients realise that the consequences of putting on weight are very serious." Thembi Nkala, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: "Being overweight or obese can have serious consequences for your heart health. "However, taking control of your weight can be a daunting task because changing the habits of a lifetime is often a challenge. "That's why it's a good idea to get support throughout your weight loss journey, which could include joining a support group." </body>

      <title>Death home saw 'institutional abuse'</title>
      <description>Institutionalised abuse took place at Orchid View, the Crawley care home that saw 19 unexplained deaths, a coroner says.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-24579496</url>

      <body>A care home where 19 residents died was riddled with "institutionalised abuse", a coroner has said. Penelope Schofield has ruled neglect contributed to five of the deaths, at Orchid View in Copthorne, near Crawley. The West Sussex coroner said the home, then run by Southern Cross, was "mismanaged and understaffed". Ms Schofield has also criticised the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which gave the home a "good" rating in 2010, a year before it closed down. A serious case review has now begun into the elderly residents' deaths. At the final day of a five-week inquest into the deaths, which were all "unexplained", Mrs Schofield said the problems at the home were from the top down and started at an early stage, but nobody did anything to address them. Orchid View has since reopened under a new name and new management. Ms Schofield said it was "disgraceful" Southern Cross was allowed to run the home in the way it was, for about two years. Referring to the CQC's rating of the home, she said: "I question how this could be the case and I question whether the inspection that did take place was fit for purpose. "It's a heartbreaking case. We all have parents who will probably need care in the latter part of their lives." Andrea Sutcliffe, the CQC's chief inspector of adult social care, said she had ordered a "root-and-branch review" of the organisation's actions in relation to Orchid View. While summing up, Ms Schofield said she had found that medical documents for resident Jean Halfpenny, 77, were falsified and that she was given too much of the blood-thinning drug warfarin. Home manager Meera Reed had earlier denied ordering staff to shred documents and filling in new forms to cover up the overdose. Continuing, the coroner said that another resident was found naked and in pain with his catheter twisted, while a family member found staff eating toast and drinking tea with their feet up. Whistleblower Lisa Martin, who first informed police of problems at Orchid View, said she felt she had no choice but to come forward. Speaking outside the inquest, she said: "I had witnessed too much poor management and care to vulnerable adults. "I couldn't live with the knowledge any longer and felt I had no choice but to tell the police." She said she knew she had done the right thing morally, but said she had not worked for two years and the case had had a huge impact on her life. Speaking of her former colleagues, she said: "They shouldn't be allowed to work in the industry." During the inquest, the coroner also said it was a cause for concern that many people who worked at Orchid View were still working in the industry. Ms Martin said when Mrs Halfpenny had to be admitted to hospital, Ms Reed looked at her forms and said: "We can't send her to hospital with those. They will shut us down." She said other forms were filled out and she was asked not to disclose the shredding of the original documents to anyone. She added that the final straw came when she was told by a nurse they had found 28 drug errors from just one night shift. She called the police who arrived the next day. Ms Schofield said that all 19 residents whose deaths were unexplained had suffered "sub-optimal" care. She said they had all died of natural causes but the deaths of 86-year-old Enid Trodden, 85-year-olds Wilfred Gardner and John Holmes, and 77-year-olds Margaret Tucker and Jean Halfpenny "had been attributed to by neglect". After the hearing, Mrs Halfpenny's daughter, Linzi Collings, said the horrific details that had emerged were beyond comprehension. She said: "How the corporate failings of Southern Cross could create these events and how such terrible standards could go unnoticed by the authorities for so long has left us baffled." She said her mother deserved to be treated with dignity and compassion, but Orchid View failed to provide her with even basic care, despite being paid a significant amount of money. Lawyers for some families have called for a public inquiry to be set up, but the coroner said she would await the outcome of the serious case review first. Ian Christian, of Irwin Mitchell solicitors, which represented seven families, said the situation at Orchid View raised questions about the quality of care provided across the industry. He said before Southern Cross closed, it had owned 752 care homes. "The evidence revealed in this inquest is deeply concerning as it shows signs of profits being put before the well-being of residents," he said. Amanda Rogers, director of adult services for West Sussex County Council, said the inquest showed a shocking example of poor care, but such examples were "isolated" and the public should "remain confident" about the levels of care in West Sussex. The CQC's Ms Sutcliffe said she was shocked at the descriptions of care at Orchid View in 2010 and 2011. She said it was "completely unacceptable" and lessons needed to be learned. She added that she would "personally oversee a root-and-branch review of our actions". Ms Sutcliffe said she had already outlined changes to how care homes would inspected, monitored and regulated in the future. </body>

      <title>Competition concern stops NHS merger</title>
      <description>Two Dorset NHS hospital trusts will not merge, the Competition Commission rules, in the first decision of its kind.</description>

      <body>Two NHS hospital trusts in Dorset will not merge, the Competition Commission (CC) has decided. The Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals and Poole Hospital Trusts wanted to become one to save money. It is the first time the Competition Commission, which normally rules on companies and commercial markets, has intervened in the NHS in England. The trusts said the decision was "fundamentally wrong" and that they would "explore alternative options". In a statement, the trusts added they were "deeply disappointed" and felt the merger was the best option to ensure "high-quality hospital services to local people". "The assessment of the merger was always weighted to put competition ahead of benefits to patients, and we do not believe the NHS is best served in this way. "The two trusts have worked extremely effectively together over the last two years and we will continue to explore areas where we can work in partnership. However, this will not be to the scale we had hoped. "It will be much more difficult to make further savings as individual organisations, but we now need to explore alternative options and work closely with our commissioners as we look to the future." The merger was referred to the commission by the Office of Fair Trading, amid concerns about allowing two competing trusts to combine. The Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has 601 beds across two sites, whilst Poole Hospital NHS Foundation Trust has 623 beds across three sites. But the CC said the merger would "damage patients' interests by eliminating competition and choice". Its chairman Roger Witcomb said the organisation was "acutely aware of the pressures facing NHS hospitals". "While the broad aims of the merger are desirable ones, there simply isn't enough detail in the hospitals' plans for us to conclude that any of the claimed benefits are likely to materialise," he said. Poole Hospital NHS Foundation Trust is already being investigated by health sector regulator Monitor amid concerns over its finances and warned it faced a deficit if the planned merger failed. The commission said it did not believe Poole would close as a result of the merger being blocked. A spokesman for the Foundation Trust Network said the decision raised "significant fears about how competition law is being applied within NHS settings and on trusts' ability to make much needed changes to how services are delivered". The NHS Confederation described the decision as a "body blow for change in the NHS". Annette Brooke, the Liberal Democrat MP for Mid Dorset and North Poole, said she was deeply concerned by the decision. "We have a big financial problem at Poole hospital and I think it's really important that it is made financially viable," she said. "One can certainly see there is a logic in merging management across two hospitals that are so close together [and] the bottom line is whether patients actually want choice over better services." Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: "It's a sad day for the NHS when competition lawyers, and not doctors, are deciding what's best for patients." A spokesman for the Department of Health said: "The review of mergers is a matter for the independent competition authorities. They must make their decisions in the best interests of patients." </body>

      <body>The UK medicines watchdog is recalling five drugs produced at an Indian factory where "manufacturing deficiencies" have been found. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is asking chemists and wholesalers to return the medicines made by Wockhardt Limited. The recalled drugs are used for pain relief and to treat type 2 diabetes. The MHRA has stressed there is no risk to patients and people should continue to take their medication as prescribed. The agency's decisions follows a precautionary recall from retail outlets by the manufacturer. It had found problems with the manufacturing process during an inspection of Wockhardt's manufacturing site in Chikalthana, India, in July. They included, poor record keeping relating to the manufacture and testing of the medicines made at the site and inadequate validation and production controls for medicines. The MHRA said it was working with Wockhardt and other international regulators to resolve these issues. The affected medicines are, in most cases, available from alternative manufacturers. Ten prescription-only medicines can continue to be made at the Chikalthana site and used in the UK. The MHRA said even though there were concerns over the continuity of supply, the benefits to patients of continuing to take these medicines outweighed that risk. It said patients did not need to return the medicines they had as there was no evidence they were defective and no evidence of a patient safety risk. But the MHRA said it had to "act in the interests of public health as poor manufacturing standards means that the quality of medicines is not guaranteed". Gerald Heddell, MHRA director of inspection, enforcement and standards, said: "People can be reassured that there is no evidence of a safety risk from the medicines made at Wockhardt's Chikalthana site, so it's important people continue to take their medicines as prescribed. "We are working with the Department of Health to ensure that people have access to the medicines they need. Anyone who has questions should speak to their pharmacist or GP."

      <title>Trust admits child deaths liability</title>
      <description>Belfast Health Trust accepts liability for the deaths of two children in its care during a public inquiry into hospital deaths in Northern Ireland.</description>

      <body>A health trust has admitted liability for the deaths of two children in its care during a public inquiry into hospital deaths in Northern Ireland. Claire Roberts and Adam Strain died months apart while they were being treated at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children in 1995 and 1996. Their deaths are being investigated by the inquiry into hyponatraemia-related deaths in Banbridge, County Down. The issue of hospital fluids management is central to the public inquiry. Hyponatraemia is the term for a low level of sodium in the bloodstream, which causes the brain cells to swell with too much water. Four-year-old Adam Strain died shortly after undergoing a kidney transplant at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children in 1995. Claire Roberts was nine when she died at the same hospital the following year. She had been admitted following vomiting and drowsiness and doctors prescribed intravenous fluids. However, Claire was given a fatal overdose of fluids and drugs. In the 17 years since her death, Belfast Health Trust had denied that fluid management played any role and wrongly attributed Claire's death to a brain virus. The trust maintained its stance during the child's inquest in 2006. However, at the public inquiry on Thursday, the trust's lawyer said his client now accepted it was liable for Claire Roberts' death and made "a full and frank admission of liability on behalf of the Belfast Trust". He said it also wanted to offer "a sincere apology for the shortcomings in the management of Claire's treatment" and acknowledged that it had failed to treat the child to an appropriate standard. During the hearing, the Belfast Health Trust also admitted publicly for the first time liability in the earlier case of Adam Strain. It had previously settled this case with Adam's family but a confidentiality clause prevented any detail of that settlement from emerging. The public inquiry is also investigating specific issues around the treatment of 15-year-old Conor Mitchell who was admitted to Craigavon Area Hospital on 8 May 2003. The following day, the teenager was transferred the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children, where he died on 12 May. At Thursday's hearing, the Southern Health Trust admitted that guidelines had not been followed when the teenager was treated in Craigavon Area Hospital and it apologised to his family. However, the Southern Health Trust has not accepted liability for Conor's death. The inquiry chairman, Justice John O'Hara QC, welcomed the admissions and acknowledged that it was "never easy to admit when mistakes had been made". Mr O'Hara said the families had made it clear that their pursuit of the truth was "in memory of their children" and that he hoped that today "they feel there is some added justification for what they have done". Speaking to BBC Northern Ireland after the hearing, Claire Roberts' parents welcomed the trust's apology and admission of liability as a small step forward but said there were still many questions over their child's death that had not been answered. The inquiry into hyponatraemia-related deaths is investigating fluid management issues after the deaths of five children in Northern Ireland hospitals. It is looking into the deaths of three of the children, the events following the death of another and a number of issues arising from the death of a fifth. The deaths all took place between 1995 and 2003, and in each case, the way in which fluids were given to the children following surgery is implicated in their deaths. On August 30, the Western Health and Social Care Trust admitted liability over the death of nine-year-old Raychel Ferguson. Raychel died in June 2001, a day after an appendix operation at Altnagelvin Hospital, Londonderry. She was administered a lethal dose of intravenous fluid after her appendix was removed. </body>

      <title>UK autism cases have 'levelled off'</title>
      <description>The number of new cases of autism being diagnosed in the UK has levelled off, following the surge of the 1990s, according to researchers.</description>

      <body>The number of new cases of autism being diagnosed in the UK has levelled off, according to researchers. The study, published in the British Medical Journal, said there had been a surge in reported cases in the 1990s, but the rise had not continued. Increased awareness and diagnosis of condition are thought to have contributed to earlier increases. The National Autistic Society said the evidence proved the condition had been around for a long time. Researchers at the Institute of Child Health at University College London looked at GP data which represented 5% of patients in the UK. They used the information to estimate the number of eight-year-olds with autism each year. The annual prevalence of autistic spectrum disorders was estimated at 3.8 per 1,000 boys and 0.8 per 1,000 girls. That figure was stable between 2004 and 2010. The study concluded there was "compelling evidence that a major rise in incidence rates of autism, recorded in general practice, occurred in the decade of the 1990s but reached a plateau shortly after 2000 and has remained steady through 2010". The researchers said changes in the way autism was diagnosed as well as greater awareness among doctors and the public explained some of the rise although "the actual cause [of the rise in the 90s] remains in large part a mystery". The study is in contrast to a report by the US Centre for Disease Control, which reported a 78% rise between 2002 and 2008. The last UK Census, which has data from more people than this study but lacks the yearly analysis of diagnoses, suggested the prevalence of autism was closer to one in 100. Carol Povey, from the National Autistic Society, said: "This study shows that, contrary to media hype, autism has been with us for a long time. "Evidence suggests that the increase in diagnoses of autism is in large part down to greater awareness of the condition, as well as better diagnostic facilities and improved skills and knowledge among those who carry out diagnoses. "More than one in 100 people in the UK have autism and it's important that we work to ensure they receive the support they need to reach their full potential." </body>

      <title>Assisting legal abortion 'not crime'</title>

      <body>There is no criminal offence if someone assists a woman in going to England for a lawful abortion, the Director of Public Prosecutions in NI has said. Barra McGrory made the comments after the BBC was told draft abortion guidelines had caused a "mood of fear" among medical staff. There have been calls for clarity after women carrying babies with fatal foetal abnormalities told their stories. Foetal abnormality is not a reason for abortion under Northern Ireland law. Draft guidelines were published in March, but following a consultation process, revised guidelines are being brought before the Stormont Executive within weeks. Health Minister Edwin Poots has said he would meet the Public Prosecution Service about the potential prosecution of staff involved in an abortion in certain circumstances. He said he was also taking legal advice from other sources. Mr Poots said he had work to do that needed to be handled sensitively and he would not be deflected from it. Mr McGrory told the BBC's Nolan Show said: "There is no criminal offence of aiding and abetting, counselling or procuring someone to have what is a lawful abortion in England," he said. "We can see no circumstances in which anyone would fall foul of the criminal law in that regard." Mr McGrory added: "The circumstances in which you are talking, of these tragic cases of foetal abnormality, where individuals have felt it necessary to travel to England to have an abortion because of serious foetal abnormality, in those circumstances, I can envisage no situation where anyone giving advice and assistance in that regard would fall foul of the law. "You cannot aid or abet or procure something which is not a crime in our law." Last week, the BBC's Nolan Show highlighted the cases of two women, whose babies had fatal foetal abnormality, who were refused terminations in Northern Ireland, Sarah Ewart travelled to England for an abortion because her baby was diagnosed with anencephaly, a severe brain abnormality. She said the baby's skull was not formed and it was brain dead. Another woman, Laura, who is 22 weeks pregnant with twins who are suffering from the same condition, appealed to Mr Poots to allow her to have an abortion in Northern Ireland. </body>

      <title>Blood test 'detects sepsis in hours'</title>
      <description>A rapid blood test to diagnose blood poisoning, or sepsis, at the hospital bedside could potentially save thousands of lives, say researchers.</description>

      <body>A rapid blood test to diagnose blood poisoning, or sepsis, at the hospital bedside could potentially save thousands of lives, say researchers. Early studies at King's College London suggest the condition can be diagnosed in two hours using a simple blood test. Current diagnostic methods take up to two days, which may delay treatment with life-saving antibiotics. The condition - caused when the body's immune system overreacts to infection - causes 37,000 UK deaths each year. In the study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, researchers identified a biomarker for diagnosing sepsis rapidly in blood samples. It is based on detecting nucleotides specific to sepsis to rule out similar conditions that can mimic its symptoms. A small study at a London hospital and a larger study in Sweden demonstrated that sepsis could be diagnosed within two hours, with an accuracy of 86%. Lead researcher Prof Graham Lord, director of the NIHR biomedical research centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London, told BBC News: "If our early phase result holds up in a large trial, it could have significant effects in saving thousands of lives and reducing the use of unnecessary antibiotics. "If we can prove its value in prospective trials, we can quite rapidly translate it into NHS clinical care." He said more research was needed to be done, but if successful, the test could be available for use in the NHS in about two years. UK Sepsis Trust chairman Dr Ron Daniels said the work paved the way for earlier detection of sepsis. "If we had a simple test that would reliably detect sepsis - particularly in vulnerable groups - it would significantly improve the reliability of the delivery of care," he said. He added: "We still need the suspicion of sepsis to be present for someone to give the test." In September, a report from the health service ombudsman found significant failings in treatment of sepsis and said more had to be done to save the lives of patients. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence will produce guidance for GPs and clinicians to help them recognise sepsis at an early stage. </body>

      <title>Call for rugby concussion lessons</title>
      <description>More should be done to protect players from the dangers of concussion, the International Rugby Board's former medical advisor says.</description>

      <body>More should be done to protect players from the dangers of concussion, the International Rugby Board's (IRB) former medical advisor said. The call comes after researchers linked suffering repeated concussions from playing sport with memory loss, depression and early dementia. Dr Barry O'Driscoll wants mandatory concussion awareness training for all grassroots rugby coaches and players. He quit his IRB job claiming the body trivialised concussion. It denies this. He said his call was directed at the unions in Wales, England, Scotland and Ireland. The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) does not have mandatory training on concussion for grassroots coaches or referees. Dr O'Driscoll told BBC Wales: "At the grassroots level - so all the way through - I would like to see a mandatory training as part of coaching courses [and] as part of schools lessons with young rugby players. "They don't need to be experts on brain surgery. What they need to do is get across a) the signs and symptoms and b) what to do." The WRU said it is committed to ensuring that player welfare is at the forefront of any decision making, and that it followed the guidelines set by the IRB. It also said it is looking at devising a nationwide education programme for all levels of the game. In England the Rugby Football Union (RFU) said it is an issue that is taken "seriously". "This year we have distributed 200,000 'Headcase' cards to the game giving advice on recognising concussion and stressing the 'if in doubt, sit it out' message. "Online resources include dedicated area of rfu.com gives advice for players, parents, teachers, coaches, medics and other volunteers. "Since 2008 around 35,000 English coaches have taken the IRB's Rugby Ready course which includes a concussion element." The Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) said: "The IRFU observe all international best practices, as set out by the International Rugby Board. "We have in place and continue to develop education and training campaigns to ensure player welfare is prioritised at all times." A call for concussion awareness in schools has also been made by the father of a 14-year-old boy from Northern Ireland who died two years ago after playing a match for his school team. Ben Robinson was knocked unconscious and suffered from concussion after several high-impact collisions during the game but he was allowed to carry on playing. He collapsed again just before the end of the game and later died in hospital. His father Peter said he would still be alive if he had been taken off the pitch. "At the start of the second half he was involved in a heavy tackle and he lay on the ground for a minute-and-a-half being treated," he said. "He was assisted to his feet... his body language looked like an old man when he was walking around but he kept being involved in heavy tackles. "It's ironic to think if he'd had a blood injury he'd have been taken off and he would be here today." Mr Robinson is pressing for concussion awareness to be taught in schools across the UK. And next month he will meet Welsh Education Minister Huw Lewis to discuss bringing the idea to Wales, having already met Scotland and Northern Ireland's ministers. "I've played rugby down the years - I don't want to change the game of rugby I just want to make it safer," Mr Robinson added. "Have all the physicality you want, just make sure at grass roots level it's a safe playing environment for the children. "We just want to make sure that it doesn't happen again and that we can educate people and maybe that helps numb the pain in some way." The IRB said its approach to the issue was driven by evidence-based expert research. "Concussion management is at the very heart of the IRB's player welfare strategy designed to protect players at all levels of the game and promote the very highest standards of education, coaching and medical care," a spokesperson said. </body>

      <title>Seeing in 3D 'possible with one eye'</title>
      <description>The effect of "vivid 3D vision" can be experienced with just one eye, a study by a Scottish university suggests.</description>

      <body>The effect of "vivid 3D vision" can be experienced with just one eye, a study has suggested. Researchers at St Andrews University said a method using a small circular hole could have wide implications for 3D technology. The study, published in Psychological Science, also has implications for people who have just one eye or difficulties with double-eye vision. The method was said to create 3D similar to effects used in film-making. Researchers said that current thinking was based on the need for two visual images - one from each eye - to be combined in the visual cortex, creating a sense of depth. But Dr Dhanraj Vishwanath, a psychologist at the university, believes both eyes are not necessary for this "3D experience". Dr Vishwanath said: "We have demonstrated experimentally, for the first time, that the same 'special way' in which depth is experienced in 3D movies can also be experienced by looking at a normal picture with one eye viewing through a small aperture (circular hole). "While this effect has been known for a long time, it is usually dismissed. "Now we have shown that it is in fact real, and the perceptual results are exactly like stereoscopic 3D, the kind seen in 3D movies. "Based on this finding, we have provided a new hypothesis of what the actual cause of the 3D experience might be." The university said the 1838 invention of the stereoscope - the technology behind 3D film-making - brought with it the assumption two eyes were necessary for 3D vision. Dr Vishwanath said: "This work has significant implications for people who don't have normal binocular vision. "First it could help them experience what it means to see in 3D. Second, it could encourage them to seek therapy to try to regain two-eye 3D vision (which produces the strongest 3D effect in everyday life) once they can see first-hand what 'seeing in 3D' is really like." Dr Vishwanath and his colleagues are now testing the method with a large group of strabismics, people with misaligned eyes. He said that nearly 15% of the population, including Hollywood actor Johnny Depp, may have some form of misalignment. The psychologist also believes his theory suggests a 3D experience could be induced simply by increasing resolution, using ultra-high definition (4K) televisions. Seeing in 3D with just one eye: Stereopsis without binocular vision is published by Psychological Science. Further research is due to be published later this year. </body>

      <title>Pet dog 'can predict epileptic fit'</title>
      <description>An Irish family say their Great Dane, Charlie, is helping to protect their three-year-old daughter by warning them when she is about to have an epileptic seizure.</description>

      <body>An Irish family has said their pet dog is helping to protect their three-year-old daughter by warning them when she is about to have an epileptic seizure. The Lynch family, from County Clare, believe their Great Dane, Charlie, can sense changes in their child up to 20 minutes before she has a fit. Brianna Lynch has epilepsy since birth. Her family said Charlie will alert them by walking in circles around Brianna. He also gently pins her against a wall to stop her from falling during a fit. Brianna's condition was picked up when she was three months old. It can lead to traumatic seizures, some of which cause her to go into a trance-like state, while others cause violent convulsions during which she is at risk of falling and hitting her head. Brianna's mother, Arabella Scanlan, said Charlie is not a trained "seizure alert dog" but was just a normal, family pet who appears to have developed some kind of special skill through his own instincts. They first noticed it some time ago when the huge Great Dane began to get agitated and walk in circles around Brianna. Minutes later the toddler had an epileptic fit. "If you see a child having a seizure, it's pretty horrific, it's frightening, it's terrible, it's gut-wrenching," Ms Scanlan said. "Charlie will know about 15 to 20 minutes before she's going into seizure. He'll get ever so panicky and giddy, almost as if you'd think 'this stupid dog is going to knock her over'." In fact, at first the family thought they might have to find another home for their clumsy Great Dane, amid concerns that he would knock the toddler down as a result of his agitation. "He's a big boy - it isn't like he's agile. When Charlie turns the whole room turns with him," Ms Scanlan said. "But he has never once knocked her over." She said the family began to notice a pattern to Charlie's behaviour, with his increased agitation often preceding one of Brianna's fits. "We kept an eye on this and, sure enough, I went into the yard one day and she (Brianna) was buckled over to the side, on top of him (Charlie). She was actually having a seizure. "She was leaning against the wall, bent over him and he just looked at me as if to say 'I don't know what to do'. But he stayed with her, he didn't move." Ms Scanlan said that since then, the dog rarely leaves Brianna's side and will gently pin her up against a wall or other surface if he senses she is about to fit. He will guard the child until help arrives. "I actually don't know the psychology behind it but, no shadow of a doubt, people are mesmerised when they see him in action. It would actually melt your heart to see them together," she added. Scientific studies have established that some dogs can be trained to "sniff out" cancers and detect low blood sugar levels in diabetic patients, but to date, there is no conclusive scientific proof that canines have an ability to predict human epileptic seizures. UK charities such as Support Dogs and Medical Detection Dogs train dogs to assist people with a variety of medical conditions. The Sheffield-based charity, Support Dogs, trains "seizure alert dogs" which it says can "give between 10-55 minutes warning prior to an oncoming seizure". Medical Detection Dogs chief executive Dr Claire Guest has personal experience of the animals' ability to detect serious illness. She was training dogs to recognise cancers, when she said one of them "started to warn her". She subsequently discovered she had an early stage breast tumour. Dr Guest said it had been established that dogs could detect human odour changes in cancer and diabetes patients but said it was not yet clear how some dogs could predict epileptic fits. She said it could be triggered by smell, but the dogs could also be responding to visual signals. It is certain that not all dogs showed signs of ability to detect illness and disease. Dr Guest said it was usually found in highly expressive dogs that were very attentive to humans and showed a general concern to protect their owners from harm. She added that most scientific studies had been initially sparked by "anecdotal reports" from pet owners who noticed a pattern of behaviour in their dogs, but said the area would benefit from more research. In 2003, findings from a preliminary study published in Seizure, European Journal of Epilepsy, suggested that "some dogs have innate ability to alert and/or respond to seizures". The study added that the success of these seizure alert dogs "depends largely on the handler's awareness and response to the dog's alerting behaviour". Charlie and Brianna's story was first reported in their local paper, the Clare Champion. The family are fundraising to a buy a new electroencephalography (EEG) machine for University Hospital Limerick, in order to accurately diagnose their daughter's condition. </body>

      <title>Is 'addiction' an excuse to overeat?</title>
      <description>Expert argues "food addiction" may just be an excuse to overeat</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24402163</url>

      <body>"Food addiction" is becoming a popular term to explain overeating. But in this Scrubbing Up, Professor John Blundell from the Institute of Psychological Sciences at the University of Leeds warns the term is being used far too freely. Some have likened food addiction to drug addiction, and then used this term to associate it with overeating, and as a clinical explanation for the obesity epidemic, implicating millions of people. The use of the term food addiction is a step towards medicalisation and implies that normal human social behaviour is pathological. Forms of eating therefore become an illness. This attitude is not helpful and has huge implications for the way in which people view their own behaviour and their lives. The concept of food addiction comes from a combination of experimental data, anecdotal observations, scientific claims, personal opinions, deductions and beliefs. It is an over-simplification of a very complex set of behaviours. The existing evidence fails to define the precise characteristics of the actual foods concerned or the eating environment that underlies the assumed addiction risk. This is in contrast to drug addiction, where the molecule is identified and its pharmacological effect on the brain is characterised. Animal studies have shown changes to specific brain regions in those given a sugary diet - and human brain scans show activation of reward systems in the same part of the brain when sweet tastes are consumed. Therefore, it is not surprising that reward centres are activated when sweet foods are consumed, as we know that the reward circuits in the brain have been established through evolution as signalling systems that control our appetite. Many stimuli influence these areas of the brain and, in addition, there is an intrinsic drive to consume carbohydrate-rich foods to satisfy a basic metabolic need of the brain. Sweetness is a major signal for such foods but the science has not yet assessed this fully and much more work is needed before we could say that food is addictive. Attributing food addiction as the single cause underlying the development of obesity, despite the existence of numerous other very plausible explanations, is unhelpful, particularly for those trying to live more healthy lives. I am concerned that many people may potentially latch on to the concept of food addiction as an excuse to explain their overeating - the premise that it's "not my fault" and therefore, "I can't help it". This removes the personal responsibility they should feel and could act on - and they infer that their eating is a form of disease. Food addiction may offer an appealing explanation for some people but the concept could seriously hinder an individual's capacity for personal control. Binge eating disorder does exist - but it is a rare clinical condition affecting fewer than 3% of obese people. Sufferers have a strong compulsion to eat, which persists alongside the sense of a loss of control. Addiction-like food behaviour may be a component of the severe and compulsive form of binge eating disorder. But this condition does not explain the huge rise in obesity we have seen across the population. Binge eating is not a key cause of obesity and, therefore, in the context of mass public health, is not a major concern. What we need is a calm and composed analysis of what the words food addiction really mean so that people can make informed deductions about the causes of their own behaviour. If you are concerned that you may have an eating disorder and would like to speak with someone about it, you could contact the charity beat on 08456341414. </body>

      <description>Two doctors attack conventional medical equipment with power tools</description>

      <body>Archimedes did it in the bath, Tesla with a walking stick and the father of the sticky note had his flash of inspiration while singing in church - or so legend has it. Yet today we expect new inventions to be born in anonymous laboratories after the submission of several grant proposals. But the age of the home-grown inventor may not be over. David Williams and John Dingley are consultant anaesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Their moment of genius came in their garages while tinkering with glue-guns and car-body filler. Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they wondered "almost jokingly" whether it might be possible to make something similarly economical and easy-to-use in the medical world. And having worked in remote settings, Dr Williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be. In Zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable mains power supply. So the doctors set themselves the challenge of inventing essential kit for the doctor's bag on a budget. And after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools, they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives. The ShakerScope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people's eyes, ears and throats. But unlike regular devices it does not need batteries. Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said: "According to the World Health Organisation, 95% of medical devices fail to work in developing countries. Often designers in the West don't understand the conditions elsewhere. "This type of invention is very important. With these scopes you would normally need three different instruments for each examination, each one requiring batteries. For low income countries this is a joke. " At the core of the ShakerScope is a powerful moveable magnet, surrounded by a coil of wire. As noted by Michael Faraday in 1831, as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induces an electric current in the coil. And shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes. "That might not sound like long but it is more than enough time for most ear or eye examinations or to insert tracheal tubes," Dr Williams said. Once the scope is shaken the charge can be stored for many weeks. And instead of using a conventional light bulb, it uses a light emitting diode which can last up to 10,000 hours. The team has designed changeable heads allowing it be converted into a number of devices. One of its most promising uses so far has been as a laryngoscope - an instrument which lights-up the back of the mouth allowing anaesthetists to insert breathing tubes when people are unable to breathe for themselves. It has already been tested in military hospitals in Afghanistan, in Uganda and after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. "In Haiti we saw a lady with a neck injury who urgently needed a tracheal tube to help stabilise her. There were no other functioning laryngoscopes close by and the ShakerScope worked well despite the difficult case," said Dr Williams. According to Dr Williams the project has been a series of steep learning curves. "Having the good idea is the easy part. Making it into a reality required an almost obsessive degree of dedication," he said. In the early days the doctors tried to do as much as possible from home - from teaching themselves microelectronics to perfecting their computer-aided design skills. Luckily for Dr Williams, his wife is a sculptor who works on large pieces of metal. He has been known to borrow her workshop, saws and glue-gun on many occasions. But he says he learned very early on that the kitchen may not be the best place to melt plastics. Dr Jerry Nolan, a consultant anaesthetist at Bath Royal United NHS Trust, who was not involved in the research said: "The ShakerScope has the potential to be invaluable in remote locations. "That they have taught themselves the skills to get a final version near to market is even more remarkable and surely disproves the adage doctors make poor businessmen." The device is one of many frugal, home-grown devices recently showcased at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in the UK. Having made several fully-functioning versions tested across the world, the doctors say they recently reached the limit of their technical abilities, and passed on further manufacturing and design to a larger company. But these anaesthetists have returned to their sheds and have many other possible irons in the fire. </body>

      <title>When an operating theatre becomes a lab</title>
      <description>Why research is key to better surgery</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24388537</url>

      <body>Scientific research takes place in a lab, doesn't it? Well, not when the developments are in surgery. Then it takes place in the clinics, wards and even the operating theatre. In this week's Scrubbing Up, Prof Dion Morton, director of research at the Royal College of Surgeons, says it is crucial that patients understand how important the work is - and that they take part. When people think about clinical trials their first thought might be of laboratories where pharmaceutical companies test the safety and effectiveness of drugs and vaccines. But in surgery too, clinical trials are a vitally important way of assessing the benefits new treatments bring to patients. Research and clinical trials are a daily part of the NHS, with many studies carried out by doctors and healthcare professionals who treat patients on a daily basis. Although 98% of people in the UK will need surgery at some point in their lives, less than 5% of government funding for medical research goes on improving surgery and developing new techniques. Surgery has been referred to as the 'Cinderella' of medical research, although funding has been slowly improving in recent years. From treating acute trauma to replacing joints after chronic disease, surgery has a broad impact and still cures more cancers than any other form of treatment. It is a vital part of the health service and investment in research is crucial if we are to be at the forefront of improving patient care. This is why new surgical clinical trial centres have been set up across the country. Surgeons are currently recruiting patients to assess new surgical techniques and determine which procedures give patients the best chance of making a full recovery. Each centre will focus on many different types of surgery including transplantation, heart and orthopaedic. Trials are challenging to design and it can be difficult to recruit patients, but with careful planning and good communication they are made possible. I am working on an international study which aims to find out at what point patients with late stage bowel cancer should be given chemotherapy. Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK and patients currently have to have surgery first to remove the cancer and then have chemotherapy. However, when the disease is advanced, all too often the cancer returns in the months or years that follow. This trial will look at whether patients who are given some chemotherapy prior to surgery are less likely to see their cancer return in the two years after treatment. In Bristol, colleagues are running a trial to compare the effectiveness of two common operations to treat severe obesity - gastric band and gastric bypass. During the course of the trial doctors will study over 700 patients, of which half will have been fitted with a gastric band and half will have had a bypass. Over three years they will compare how much weight patients' lose, whether they experience any complications following surgery and to what extent their quality of life improves following the operation. Obesity is a rapidly increasing global health problem which costs the NHS billions of pounds. Surgery is both a clinically-effective and cost-effective way of treating this disease and so the results of this trial will help the NHS decide which of these two treatments they should offer to patients. Surgical research has the potential to make real improvements in the way we care and treat patients. Patient safety and innovation go hand in hand as it is the evidence gained from these trials that will ultimately lead to reduced patient mortality and sickness. Despite limited investment, surgeons are striving to develop the evidence for new techniques and procedures that can change the face of hospital care. Raising standards, delivering new surgical treatments to patients and delivering them safely nationwide is central to a high quality health service. </body>

      <description>The drugs derived from deadly poisons</description>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <title>Where the penalty for miscarriage is jail</title>
      <description>A country where a woman may be jailed for losing a child</description>

      <body>El Salvador has one of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the world. A side-effect is that women who suffer miscarriages are sometimes suspected of inducing an abortion - and can even be jailed for murder. Glenda Xiomara Cruz was crippled by abdominal pain and heavy bleeding in the early hours of 30 October 2012. The 19-year-old from Puerto El Triunfo, eastern El Salvador, went to the nearest public hospital where doctors said she had lost her baby. It was the first she knew about the pregnancy as her menstrual cycle was unbroken, her weight practically unchanged, and a pregnancy test in May 2012 had been negative. Four days later she was charged with aggravated murder - intentionally murdering the 38-to-42 week foetus - at a court hearing she was too sick to attend. The hospital had reported her to the police for a suspected abortion. After two emergency operations and three weeks in hospital she was moved to Ilopango women's prison on the outskirts of the capital San Salvador. Then last month she was sentenced to 10 years in jail, the judge ruling that she should have saved the baby's life. Her lawyer, Dennis Munoz Estanley, says the legal system has an inbuilt "presumption of guilt" making it hard for women to prove their innocence. "She is yet another innocent victim of our unjust and discriminatory legal system which jails poor, young women who suffer obstetric complications for murder on the most flimsy evidence," he says. Xiomara's father describes the conviction as a "terrible injustice". He testified in court that his daughter had endured years of domestic violence at the hands of her partner. And yet the prosecution - which sought a 50-year jail term - relied heavily on this man's allegation that she had intentionally killed the foetus. Xiomara has not seen her four-year-old daughter since the miscarriage. El Salvador is one of five countries with a total ban on abortion, along with Nicaragua, Chile, Honduras and Dominican Republic. Since 1998, the law has allowed no exceptions - even if a woman is raped, her life is at risk or the foetus is severely deformed. More than 200 women were reported to the police between 2000 and 2011, of whom 129 were prosecuted and 49 convicted - 26 for murder (with sentences of 12 to 35 years) and 23 for abortion, according to research by Citizens' Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion. Seven more have been convicted since 2012. The study underlines that these women are overwhelmingly poor, unmarried and poorly educated - and they are usually denounced by public hospital staff. Not a single criminal case originated from the private health sector where thousands of abortions are believed to take place annually. Munoz has worked with 29 of the incarcerated women, helping secure the early release of eight. "Only one intentionally induced an abortion, the other 28 suffered natural obstetric complications but were jailed for murder without any direct evidence," he says. Last year when Maria Teresa Rivera suffered a miscarriage, she was sentenced to 40 years in jail for aggravated murder. Like Xiomara, Teresa, 28, had no pregnancy symptoms before sudden severe pain and bleeding, and was reported to police by the public hospital where she had sought emergency help. The scientific evidence was flimsy, according to Munoz who will soon lodge an appeal, and the prosecution relied heavily on a colleague of hers, who testified that Rivera had said she "might be" pregnant a full 11 months before the miscarriage. A textile factory worker, she was the family's only breadwinner and her eight-year-old son is now living in dire poverty with his grandmother. Cristina Quintanilla's story is different. On 24 October 2004, the 18-year-old from rural San Miguel was seven months pregnant with her second child, living with her mother in the capital to be near a hospital for the birth. Her boyfriend was working in the US, but the couple were excited buying baby clothes and saving food tokens. "Around midnight I felt an immense pain, I thought I was dying," Quintanilla says. "I was banging on the bathroom door to get my mum's attention when I felt the baby drop out. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital." Her mother called the police - a typical step for Salvadorans in an emergency, who took them to hospital. Quintanilla was given an anaesthetic, and interrogated when she came round. Then she was handcuffed to the hospital bed, charged with manslaughter and transferred to a police cell. The first judge dismissed the case, but the prosecution appealed, upgrading the charge to aggravated murder. Quintanilla was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in jail, where she was vilified as a child killer. Her son Daniel, then only four, spent four years living with his great-grandmother until Munoz succeeded in having the sentence reduced to three years. "The medical reports couldn't explain why the baby died, but the prosecutor made me out to be a criminal who could have saved my baby even though I had passed out in pain," she says. "I will never understand why they did this to me, I lost four years of my life and still don't know why I lost my baby." Morena Herrera from Citizens' Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion says these cases have had a chilling effect, with many pregnant poor women who suffer miscarriages or complications during pregnancy "too afraid to seek medical help". "I would be terrified to go a public hospital as there is no benefit of doubt given to young women, we are presumed guilty and jailed," says Bessy Ramirez, 27, from San Salvador. "We cannot even rely on health staff to put their prejudices aside and treat us confidentially." The strict abortion law has other serious human rights implications. Suicide was the most common cause of death in 2011 among 10-to-19-year-old girls, half of whom were pregnant, according to Health Ministry figures. It was also the third most common cause of maternal mortality. Earlier this year, the plight of lupus sufferer Beatriz, 22, attracted international condemnation after the Supreme Court refused to authorise an abortion, even though her life was at risk and the foetus too deformed to be viable. Beatriz's health deteriorated while the court deliberated for several months. She gave birth at 27 weeks. The baby died within hours. Individual members of the current FMLN government, particularly Health Minister Maria Isabel Rodriguez, criticised the abortion law during the controversy over Beatriz's case. But the government has made no attempt to repeal or relax the law since coming to power in 2009, as it remains popular with large parts of the conservative population, who revere the Church and pro-life religious groups such as Si a la Vida (Yes to Life). The Arena Party, which is strongly allied with the Church, is favourite to win next year's General Election. But Esther Major, Amnesty International's El Salvador expert, describes the country's abortion law as "cruel and discriminatory". "Women and girls end up in prison for being unwilling, or simply tragically unable, to carry the pregnancy to term," she says. "It makes seeking hospital treatment for complications during pregnancy, including a miscarriage, a dangerous lottery. "It cannot be in the interests of society to criminalise women and girls in this way." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <description>Can supplements actually be dangerous?</description>

      <body>Millions of people swear by vitamin supplements. But many are wasting their time and some could even be harming themselves, argues Dr Chris van Tulleken. In November 1912 a party of three men and 16 dogs set out from a remote base in eastern Antarctica to explore a series of crevasses many hundreds of miles away. Three months later just one of the men returned. His name was Douglas Mawson. His skin was peeling off and his hair was falling out. He had lost almost half his body weight. He recounted what Sir Edmund Hillary described as "the greatest story of lone survival in the history of polar exploration". A month into their journey, one of the team, along with the tent, most of the provisions and six dogs plunged into a crevasse, never to be seen again. Mawson and the other surviving member, Xavier Mertz, started to return to base, surviving in part by eating the remaining dogs. After a few weeks Mertz developed stomach pains and diarrhoea. Then his skin started to peel off and his hair fell out. He died incontinent and delirious a few days later. Mawson suffered similar symptoms. With the kind of understatement typical of his generation of polar explorers he described the skin of the soles of his feet peeling off: "The sight of my feet gave me quite a shock, for the thickened skin of the soles had separated in each case as a complete layer... The new skin underneath was very much abraded and raw." It was the suffering of early explorers and sailors that motivated the first studies of vitamins and their deficiency diseases. At first sight Mawson's story seems to be another such tale - starvation combined with a lack of some vital nutrient. In fact, Mawson's description of his symptoms is an almost textbook description of vitamin A overdose - probably from eating dog liver. As little as 100g of husky liver could give a hungry explorer a fatal dose. Mawson lived to the decent age of 76 but in his story we find the cautionary tale for our times - vitamins can be very bad for you. This piece is about what we have learned about vitamin supplements in the last few years - if you are healthy, and you live in a country like the UK, taking multi-vitamins and high-dose antioxidants may shorten your life. For most of us, for most of the time, they're unhealthy. "Argh!" I hear you say, "I spend loads of money on them and the claims on the packet are really persuasive. Everything, from my full head of hair to my sex life, depends on them!" I want to get into this in a bit more detail because the vitamin companies certainly don't agree with me. So why do we believe they're useful and why do we take them? Vitamins are essential for life, and there are groups of people even in the UK who benefit from specific supplementation, but general unsupervised vitamin pill-popping is more than just a waste of money. The problem is that we all feel very warm and fuzzy about vitamins because, firstly, the tales of deficiency are so horrific, secondly, we read breakfast cereal packs and thirdly, a double-Nobel laureate called Linus Pauling liked vitamin C in vast, vast doses. All this is packaged by the people now selling us vitamins over the counter into that most beguiling of all logical falsehoods - if a little is good, then more must be better. Now I knew the names of the most obscure vitamins long before medical school because I have always had a fondness for the kind of multicoloured, artificially flavoured breakfast cereals that are marketed using a combination of unlikely cartoon animals and claims of being "vitamin and mineral-enriched". And it has to be said that this vitamin and mineral enrichment of staple food has been one of the most effective public health interventions in history. It continues to save countless lives per year even in Europe. So, while you shouldn't eat dog liver in Antarctica, vitamin A deficiency hugely increases the risk of blindness and death in children with measles and diarrhoea in developing countries. So the World Health Organization recommends a very strict amount and cautions that higher doses can cause birth defects in early pregnancy among other problems. So vitamins do make a huge difference to life expectancy in some circumstances, which is persuasive, and the breakfast propaganda catches us in our most vulnerable, bleary-eyed, early morning state, hinting to us that these vitamins have some sort of catch-all, beneficial effect on our lives, that will transform us into the healthy, energetic beautiful people/cartoon creatures portrayed on the cereal box. These things contribute to a general ideal of healthfulness of vitamins. And then there's Linus Pauling. Whether or not you've heard of him, Linus Pauling is a major influence on vitamin and nutrient culture. It's almost impossible to imagine someone with more authority and credibility. He won two Nobel prizes and was, by all accounts, a genuinely good bloke. He wrote a book in 1970 saying that high doses of vitamin C could be effective in combating flu, cancer, cardiovascular disease, infections and degenerative problems. He took immense quantities himself, hundreds of times the required amount, and lived to a ripe old age surrounded by many great grandchildren. He was the poster boy for mega-dosing of vitamins and this contributed to the growth of an industry supported by the belief that supplementation of these molecules in our diet is beneficial in almost every way imaginable. But rather than taking one man's word for it, however credible, it's worth looking at the results of studies that look at what happens to people who take these supplements for long periods of time. Looking at any one individual study won't be very revealing to answer the question of whether vitamin supplementation is good for you. They're densely scientific and the conflicts of interest can be very hard to spot. For the answer you have to turn to what are called "systematic review papers". This is where independent scientists gather up all the available data and re-analyse it to answer big questions. Here's what a couple of them say: "We found no evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention [of diseases of any kind]. Beta-carotene and vitamin E seem to increase mortality, and so may higher doses of vitamin A. Antioxidant supplements need to be considered as medicinal products and should undergo sufficient evaluation before marketing". (See references below). Just to be clear - "increase mortality" - that means they're killing you. These are powerfully bioactive compounds but they're not regulated in the same way as drugs. Whatever you think about the regulation there should surely be a warning on the pack if there's data saying they're bad for us. The next question is - why are they bad for us? It's very hard to pick apart the data, partly because vitamins are a fabulously diverse group of chemicals. I'm going to include what people normally refer to as minerals under the heading of vitamins. They're required in the diet not for energy, but as chemical partners for the enzymes involved in the body's metabolism - cell production, tissue repair, and other vital processes. Their functions are understood largely by their deficiency diseases so we're not exactly sure of precisely what they all do or how they interact. Antioxidants provide a nice example. They soak up the very toxic, chemically-reactive by-products of metabolism called free radicals. These free radicals, left unchecked, can cause damage to DNA and may be linked to cancer. Your cells are full of antioxidants but surely taking more would be better? Right? Keep those cancer causing radicals under control? Well, unfortunately, your body's immune system fights infections by using free radicals to kill bugs. Exactly what effect huge quantities of extra antioxidants could have on this is not clear but it's easy to imagine that it might not be good and you could get more infections. Vitamin A is linked to increasing lung cancer in smokers. Excess zinc is linked to reduced immune function. Long-term excessive intake of manganese is linked to muscle and nerve disorders in older people. Niacin in excess has been linked to cell damage. And so on. And it gets more complicated still when you start mixing everything up in one tablet. For example, different minerals compete for absorption. If you take large quantities of calcium you won't be able to absorb your iron. If you take large quantities of iron you won't be able to absorb zinc. If you take vitamin C you'll reduce your copper level. So it's not just that taking lots of one thing is not good for you, it's that it may cause a dangerous reduction in something else even if you are also supplementing that. To work out the optimal ratios is all but impossible although some manufactures claim to have worked it out. So when are supplements recommended? The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends certain supplements for some groups of people who are at risk of deficiency, including: Your GP may also recommend supplements if you need them for a medical condition. If you decide to take supplements, stick to within the RDA, unless you've had guidance from a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist to exceed the dose. If you've got questions about dosage levels, consult a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist. The tales of deficiency combined with the success of enrichment programmes mean that it's easy to make that leap of logic that if a little is good then more must be better. And if you read my article last week on water you'll see where this is going. I could do this every week. The same article. Substitute water for vitamins/probiotics/antibiotics. Don't trust the science done by the people who are trying to sell them to you and don't assume that if some is good more must be better. It's like beer. Or coffee. Or computer games. Goldilocks was right about things needing to be just right. References: Bjelakovic G, Nikolova D, Simonetti RG, Gluud C.

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>Can too much rumination be dangerous?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24444431</url>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <title>Why I write my Down's dad blog</title>

      <body>The Future's Rosie recently won "best new blog" at the MAD (Mum and Dad) Blog awards. In it, Thomas Bachofner documents the progress of his two-year-old daughter, Rosie, who has Down's Syndrome. But why does he blog about it? I'm a graphic designer from Cheshire, not known for writing or reading any books. So it came as a surprise to me that I could even string a sentence together, let alone write a blog that is well received - I'm guessing it's because it comes from the heart. My site is about Rosie's achievements, such as last week when she stood up for the first time, but it also gives me an opportunity to do my little bit towards raising positive awareness of Down's. The first post was published on 14 February 2012 but the idea to share our story with the world came much earlier. When my wife Karen and I learnt that our unborn daughter had Down's syndrome, it was a shock, and it didn't feel like anybody understood our predicament. As a parent, you assume that everything will be fine. Our two boys, Harry and Joe, were born without complications. But we were told about Rosie's condition in such a negative way that we thought it would change our lives drastically for the worse. I found that all I wanted to do was read real-life parent stories from people in our situation, not the science and figures you become bombarded with when searching online. But there weren't many Down's syndrome parenting blogs around at the time and even fewer were written from a dad's perspective. I started to jot things down and was surprised to find that it helped get my emotions out. My scribbles eventually turned into The Future's Rosie which is having more of an impact on me and others than I could ever have predicted. Initially it was a handy way of telling my friends and family how I was feeling and it meant I didn't have to repeat myself over and over at what was a delicate time for me. But many of them began to share it with their friends and, before I knew it, my blog was being read by hundreds of people. I've shared lots of private thoughts about her development and how we as a family are all pitching in to help her. Last year I wrote about what I called "a barbaric-looking developmental aid" given to Rosie by her physio. It's a standing brace and we couldn't get her to use it. She hadn't wanted to walk or crawl, so we got Rosie's brothers to stand on the sofa and blow bubbles which made her reach up and support her body with her legs in order to strengthen them. I've covered learning the Makaton sign language, feeling full of pride when my young sons Harry and Joe stood on stage at school to give a talk about Down's to 250 kids, and I wrote about the weekend we all survived without Mummy being there. One of the hardest things I have done is write about Rosie's surgery. Children with Down's syndrome often have related heart difficulties and Rosie was born with a hole in the heart which needed fixing. My blog entry on that day included post-op pictures of my daughter - it felt like these might be useful for parents to see, if they too have to face the same operation with their Down's syndrome child. As Rosie got older, I quickly learned that my own pre-conceived ideas of Down's were both ignorant and outdated. I wanted to teach others about the reality in a non-patronising manner, so decided to use myself as an example in my own social media campaign. I did it from Rosie's perspective and called it Things I've Taught My Daddy. As with the blog, before I knew it the captioned images I shared on Facebook and Twitter had been seen by thousands worldwide. One of the messages I tried to communicate was that people with Down's are people first and foremost. They are more like their families than they are each other, though many people still find it difficult to see past the physical characteristics associated with the syndrome. Life with Rosie really is very normal, in fact she has been a far easier baby than both her older brothers were. The whole family love her to pieces and I genuinely wouldn't change a single thing about her - well, maybe the volume of her cries when she is hungry. After all "Down's syndrome" isn't who she is, it is just a part of her. Thomas Bachofner blogs at The Future's Rosie You can follow Ouch on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>Immunisation has been one of the great success stories of global health. It is estimated to prevent the deaths of two to three million children each year. But another 1.5 million children still die from diseases that could be prevented by routine vaccines. The eradication of smallpox in 1980 helped encourage global efforts to fight more diseases through immunisation. These maps chart the growth of global vaccine coverage from 1980 and show which countries are doing best - and worst - at protecting their population. The three vaccines illustrated combat five infections and have been chosen as they demonstrate varying levels of progress against several major diseases. Source: WHO and UNICEF estimates of national routine immunization coverage, 2012 data revision (July 2013). The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 1.5 million deaths children under five die each year from diseases that could have been prevented by routine immunisation. The chart shows that pneumococcal diseases and rotavirus infection are responsible for around two thirds of these deaths. The former causes pneumonia and the latter is the most common cause of severe diarrhoea. Vaccines against the main causes of both infections have been introduced in the past decade. They are now routinely available in wealthier countries and are being gradually introduced across the developing world. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) has preliminary plans to support the introduction of rotavirus vaccines in more than 30 of the world's poorest countries by 2015. More than 25 developing countries have begun using pneumococcal vaccines and it hopes to rollout the jab in 45 countries by 2015.

      <description>Draft guidelines on abortion in NI 'worry medical staff'</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-24550586</url>

      <body>Draft guidelines on abortion issued in Northern Ireland in March have caused a "mood of fear" among medical staff, according to a retired obstetrician. Prof Jim Dornan has more than 40 years of experience in obstetric medicine. He said health trusts had sought legal advice over the implications for staff in the draft guidelines. He added that some NI trusts were told by their legal teams that staff should stop giving advice to pregnant women in cases of foetal abnormality. Prof Dornan was speaking to BBC Radio Ulster amid recent controversy over two such cases, where pregnant women requested abortions in Northern Ireland because their babies had been diagnosed with anencephaly, a severe brain abnormality. Sarah Ewart and another woman, known only as Laura, were both told their babies would die either before or shortly after birth, but they were both refused terminations as foetal abnormality is not a reason for abortion under Northern Ireland law. Prof Dornan said cases of this kind had started to emerge as a result of changes laid out in the new draft abortion guidelines published in March. He said the draft guidelines had introduced two new measures that medical staff had found "particularly offensive". Those measures, he said were the warning that staff could face ten years in jail if they failed to report their suspicions of unlawful terminations to police, and also the recommendation that only a consultant psychiatrist should decide whether or not a pregnancy should be terminated on the grounds of risk to a woman's mental health. Prof Dornan said: "The mood is fear within the health care professionals because of these guidelines." He added: "Some of the trusts went to their legal teams at that stage (March) and were advised to stop...giving advice on what to do in these situations." The retired obstetrician worked as director of foetal medicine at the Royal Maternity Hospital in Belfast for 20 years and was a member of the committee that drew up the previous guidelines on abortion in Northern Ireland. He said: "It has always been made very clear to us that case law in Northern Ireland 100% allows a pregnancy to be delivered before 24 weeks in certain circumstances. Those circumstances are that they are definitely not because there is a foetal abnormality but because of the effect of the abnormality on the physical or mental health of the mother." However, Prof Dornan said that after a recent judicial review, Northern Ireland's Department of Health "then brought forward new guidelines in March this year that bore no resemblance to the previous guidelines". "There were two areas that were particularly offensive to those of us who have been providing this very sensitive care for over 50 years - the assessment of mental health. It was suggested that this should be by a psychiatrist and not by the team of geneticists, paediatricians, obstetricians and midwives who have been doing it for 50 years. "Secondly, they said that any healthcare worker, including non-clinical healthcare workers, if they suspected that something illegal was going or in their unit, they must report it to the PSNI or risk ten years in jail." However, he added that he was "greatly heartened" to hear the Health Minister Edwin Poots say that he would ask the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to "state unequivocally what the chances are of conviction under present law should any health care workers be involved". Mr Poots offered to meet both women involved in the recent abortion controversy and to examine the legal implications for staff who are asked to carry out terminations in cases of fatal foetal abnormality. Prof Dornan said: "I think that'll be very, very helpful. I really can't see the DPP coming out with any other thing other than to say that what we were doing right up until March of this year was within the law." He told BBC Radio Ulster that every year, about about 200 pregnancies in Northern Ireland will involve "major genetic or anatomical problems" with the foetus. He said that in the vast majority of problem pregnancies in Northern Ireland, obstetricians "work very closely with our paediatric colleagues and do our best to maximise outcome for the mother and the baby". "Some women have got the skill set that they can continue with a pregnancy, some do not. "We support them all, all life should be respected and is respected. All of those of us involved in this healthcare area respect life. We are all pro-life, but we are pro-life of the mother and pro-life of everybody," Prof Dornan added. </body>

      <title>Where ill people are locked in cages with hyenas</title>
      <description>Where deadly hyenas are used to treat mental illness</description>

      <body>Somalia has one of the highest rates of mental illness in the world and with a healthcare system devastated by years of war, most sufferers receive no medical help. Many are chained up - to trees or at home. Some are even locked in cages with hyenas. But one man is trying to change all that. Dr Hab's advert runs up to three times a day on Mogadishu's radio stations. "He's gone crazy! He's running away!" screams the actor. "Chain him down!" The scenario is familiar in Somalia. A man has become possessed by spirits and the only option for his family is to restrain him and call the sheikh. But as the young man protests, a voice that challenges Somali tradition booms out. "Stop with the chains!" the voiceover orders. "Take him to Dr Hab's hospital! If he's having mental problems, take him to Dr Hab. He won't chain him, he'll help him." Dr Hab is not actually a real psychiatrist. Rather it's the persona of Abdirahman Ali Awale, a nurse who after three months of specialist training from the World Health Organization (WHO), has made it his mission to rescue Somalia's mentally ill. He claims he is able to treat everything from post-natal depression to schizophrenia. But the alternative to a trip to Hab could be a visit to one of Somalia's popular herbalists or sheikhs who still advocate traditional - and sometimes barbaric - cures. "There is a belief in my country that hyenas can see everything including the evil spirits people think cause mental illness," says Hab. "So in Mogadishu, you will find hyenas that have been brought from the bush and families will pay £350 ($560) to have their loved one locked in the room overnight with the animal." The expensive treatment - more than the average annual wage - is as brutal as it sounds. By clawing and biting at the patient, the hyena is thought to force the evil spirit out. Patients, including young children, have been known to die during the process. "We are trying to show people that this is nonsense," says Hab. "People listen to our radio advert and they learn that mental illness is just like any other and needs to be treated with scientific methods." Hab's campaign was prompted by an incident in 2005 when he witnessed a group of female patients being chased through the streets by youths. "There was no-one to help them," he says. "I decided after that I would have to open Somalia's first mental hospital." The Habeb Public Mental Health Hospital in Mogadishu became the first of Hab's six centres across Somalia. Together, they have now treated over 15,000 patients. There were only three practising psychiatrists in the whole of Somalia at the last count, and Hab - despite his lack of advanced qualifications - is head of what has become the country's leading provider of mental health services. He even carries a letter from the minister of health that says so. Hab faces a near insurmountable task. WHO estimates that one in three Somalis either is or has been affected by mental illness, compared to a global average of one in 10. In parts of the country, where the population has been the most psychologically scarred from decades of conflict, the rate is even higher. Cases of post-traumatic stress disorder are common and the situation is further complicated by widespread substance abuse. "Khat is a big, big problem," says Hab of the herbal stimulant which has been chewed for centuries in East Africa. Side effects are thought to include anxiety and even psychosis. "We treat them in the hospital and they leave, but then they start eating khat again. Sometimes I see the same patients seven or eight times." Western aid agencies in Somalia have often promoted projects targeting communicable diseases, not least because results are quicker and cheaper to obtain. Hab, meanwhile, says he is left to run his organisation with minimal resources and an erratic supply of psychotropic medicines that he sources from NGOs and private pharmacies. Even getting sufferers to recognise that their condition constitutes an illness is difficult. Psychological problems are more likely to be reported by Somalis as physical pain - headaches, sweating, and chest pain. Some concepts of mental illness do not even exist in Somali culture - depression, for example, translates as "the feelings a camel has when its friend dies". But nothing is more indicative of the population's poor understanding of mental health than the widespread practice of chaining-up sufferers to trees and in rooms. GRT, an Italian NGO, has documented sufferers who have been chained up their entire life. "I myself have saved many patients who have been left to die," says Hab who drives a minibus into rural areas, unchaining people and taking them to one of his centres. "Parents, siblings, relatives - they've just been chained up to a tree and the family has gone." The WHO has funded a "Chain Free Initiative", with the aim of eradicating the practice altogether, starting with the use of chains in hospitals. But even Hab admits to having chained up some of his most aggressive patients. He tells the story of how, in 2007, one unintended consequence of his acquisition of a batch of the anti-psychotic drug, fluphenazine hydrochloride, was an increased appetite in his patients. They took to scaling the walls of his hospital in Mogadishu to scavenge for food. But still desperately unwell, some of the escapees had been shot when they ignored orders at a military checkpoint. Chaining them to their beds, concluded Hab, was the only option. "Many patients take a long time to treat," he says. "There has been no outside help focussed on treating mental health problems and the main reason NGOs are not getting involved is because of the expense." Hab is motivated by the thousands of patients he believes remain chained up in private homes. He sends through a spreadsheet showing what he needs - new mattresses, food for patients, and diesel for his minibus. There is also a shortage of qualified psychiatrists and nurses. The daily struggle to provide for his patients and the suffering he witnesses is clearly taking its toll. "Physiologically and mentally it's a very hard job" he says. "I was healthy when I started, now I suffer from diabetes. I am dealing with big, big problems all by myself. "I have cried on TV, I have cried in public places, I have cried in front of presidents," he says. "Even now I feel like crying." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>Millions of people around the world have learned CPR on a mannequin known as Resusci Anne. The story of the 19th Century beauty behind the model - or at least, one version of it - will be told at a symposium in London to mark European Restart a Heart Day. But does anyone really know anything about her? The Lorenzi workshop is a small haven of peace and antiquity in the busy Parisian suburb of Arcueil. And it's the last of its kind. Downstairs the mouleurs, or cast-makers, create figurines, busts and statues, pouring plaster into moulds in much the same way they have since the family business started in the 1870s. But if you want to be face-to-face with history, pick your way up the dusty wooden stairs to a room above the workshop. It's an unsettling experience. Hanging all around you in the narrow attic are life and death masks of poets and artists, politicians and revolutionaries: Napoleon, Robespierre, Verlaine, Victor Hugo, the robust, impatient face of the living Beethoven and the sallow, diminished features of the composer's death mask. Yet, surprisingly, of all the visages of the great and the good on display at Lorenzi's, the best-seller is the mask of a young woman. She has a pleasant, attractive face, with the hint of a smile playing on her lips. Her eyes are closed but they look as if they might spring open at any moment. Hers is the one mask that has no name. She's known simply as the Inconnue, the unknown woman of the Seine. This is how her story goes. Some time in the late 19th Century, the drowned body of a young woman was recovered from the River Seine. As was customary in those days, her body was put on display at the Paris mortuary, in the hope that someone would recognise and identify her. The pathologist on duty became so entranced by the face of the girl with the enigmatic half-smile that he asked a moulder to take a plaster cast of her face. Before long the mask began to appear for sale outside the mouleurs' workshops on the Left Bank and soon the young woman's face became a muse for artists, novelists and poets, all eager to weave imagined identities and stories around the mystery woman, this drowned Mona Lisa. Over the years Rilke, Louis Aragon, Man Ray and Vladimir Nabokov successively fell under the Inconnue's spell and at one time no fashionable European drawing room was complete without a mask of the Inconnue on the wall. One of the first stories featuring her was the 1899 novella The Worshipper of the Image by Richard le Gallienne, who portrays the mask as a malevolent force which bewitches and ultimately destroys a young poet. Other authors have been kinder, many of them telling the story of an innocent young woman from the country who comes to Paris, who's seduced by a rich lover and then abandoned when she falls pregnant. With nobody to turn to, she drowns herself in the waters of the Seine, a modern Ophelia. At the mortuary, her beautiful face, now peaceful in death, is preserved forever with a plaster cast. It was another drowning - or near-drowning - that ensured the Inconnue a place in medical history. In 1955 Asmund Laerdal saved the life of his young son, Tore, grabbing the boy's lifeless body from the water just in time and clearing his airways. Laerdal at that time was a successful Norwegian toy manufacturer, specialising in making children's dolls and model cars from the new generation of soft plastics. When he was approached to make a training aid for the newly-invented technique of CPR - cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the combination of chest compressions and the kiss of life which can save the life of a patient whose heart has stopped - his son's brush with death a few years earlier made him very receptive. He developed a torso or whole-body mannequin which simulates an unconscious patient requiring CPR. Asmund wanted his mannequin to have a natural appearance. He also felt that a female doll would seem less threatening to trainees. Remembering a mask on the wall of his grandparents' house many years earlier, he decided that the Inconnue de la Seine would become the face of Resusci Anne. So if you're one of the 300 million people who's been trained in CPR, you've almost certainly had your lips pressed to the Inconnue's. Through Resusci Anne, students of first aid have for more than 50 years been trying to bring back to life the young woman from the Seine. But was the Inconnue actually dead in the first place? Is that peaceful face really a death mask or was it taken from a live model? When a few years ago I was making a Radio 4 programme about the Inconnue with the novelist Louise Welsh, we decided to show the mask to the men and women who specialise in recovering drowned bodies from the Seine - the Paris river police, known as the Brigade Fluviale. Sitting in the wheelhouse of one of the brigade's boats moored at their headquarters near the Pont d'Austerlitz, Chief Brigadier Pascal Jacquin was less than convinced that the girl was dead when the mask was made. "It's surprising to see such a peaceful face," he said. "Everyone we find in the water, the drowned and suicides, they never look so peaceful. They're swollen, they don't look nice." Over the centuries, artists and writers may have used the stories of Ophelia and the Lady of Shallot to portray drowning as a romantic and peaceful death but Pascal knows from years of dredging bodies out of the Seine that the truth is very different. Even suicides fight for life at the last moment and their faces betray that struggle. And the process of decomposition starts much more quickly in water too. This woman, he remarked, "looks like she's just asleep and waiting for Prince Charming to come". Like so many others before him, Jacquin's imagination had been piqued by the young woman's face and he had already begun to weave a tale of his own around the closed eyes, that secretive little smile and the enigma of the Inconnue. Other experts we consulted seemed to agree that the Inconnue seemed just too healthy, too vital for the mask to have been taken from a corpse. At the workshop in Arcueil, Michel Lorenzi, the current proprietor, is mystified by people's fascination with the Inconnue. "This doesn't look to me like the face of a dead person. It's very hard to maintain a smile while a cast is being taken so I think she was a professional, a very good model." For me the story has two postscripts. The first came a few weeks after the programme was broadcast in 2009. I was visiting Edward Chambre Hardman's photographic studio in Liverpool, the National Trust's perfectly preserved time capsule from the first half of the 20th Century, where anyone who was anyone in Liverpool sat for a portrait with Hardman. Seeing the mask of the Inconnue on the wall of his waiting room, I asked the guide, disingenuously, who the young woman was. Without hesitating she told me the story of two sisters, identical twins, who'd been born in Liverpool more than a century ago. One of them, she said, had embarked on a love affair with a rich suitor and eloped to Paris, never to be seen again. Many years later the other sister had visited Paris on holiday. Walking down a street she was shocked to see the mask of the drowned Inconnue hanging outside the mouleurs' workshops. She had instantly recognised the girl as her long-lost twin, condemned - or blessed - to remain forever young, while her sister grew old. I was captivated by the story. Once again, a tapestry of imagination had been woven around the enigma of the Inconnue and in this case it had been given a Liverpool twist. The other postscript comes from an Oxford-based artist called John Goto. Several years ago he decided to create his own fiction for the Inconnue. He constructed an apparently factual account of detective work and a trail of clues leading to the discovery of a turn-of-the-century carte de visite in a Buenos Aires junk shop. This and other evidence supposedly proved finally and beyond doubt the identity of the Inconnue - she was as a Hungarian actress named Ewa Lazlo, who was murdered by her lover, Louis Argon. Goto put the story and its "supporting evidence" online and moved on to other projects. It was intriguing, therefore, to come across details of this week's London symposium for European Restart a Heart Day. During the day a series of speakers share the latest research on improving survival rates after cardiac arrest. But in the evening entertainment is provided by the ensemble Mulberry Hawk. They're putting on a performance which, according to the blurb, "tells the story of Ewa Lazlo who became the inspiration for the face of Resusci Anne, the first CPR training manikin, and the most kissed girl in the world". So, I thought, Ewa is beginning to take on a life of her own. In fact several websites and blogs are quoting as fact that she's the Inconnue. Goto admits to feeling a little uncomfortable with his creation. "I'd assumed that people would have a postmodern view and treat it as fictional," he told me. "I really didn't expect them to take it seriously." But even if Ewa is an object lesson in not believing quite everything you read on the internet, it's unlikely that the story will go much further. What we love about the Inconnue is the uncertainty, the enigma. As Louise Welsh remarked when we returned from recording our search for this drowned Mona Lisa in Paris, the mask's value lies in its mystery. "The moment we have a name, a life story, that mystery is dead." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>McCartney plays surprise London gig</title>
      <description>Sir Paul McCartney delivers an impromptu gig in Covent Garden during the lunchtime rush.</description>

      <body>Sir Paul McCartney has given an impromptu gig in Covent Garden during the lunchtime rush. "Good afternoon," he told that assembled crowd of more than 2,000 fans. "Welcome to Covent Garden." "We're just going to do some songs from our new album so get your phones out... As if they weren't already," he added. The 71-year-old sang four songs from his latest album, New, from a truck parked on the piazza. It follows a similar stunt in New York last week. The London gig began at 1330 BST, about an hour after Sir Paul announced it on Twitter. "I'm getting ready to pop up in Covent Garden," the former Beatle tweeted. "Oh baby!" "Alright! Busking!" he joked after taking to the stage, watched by his daughter, Stella. "This is a change from the '60s because we would just have been coming in from the clubs right now." The singer opened with his current single, also called New, and closed with the same song approximately 20 minutes later, telling the audience: "Thank you very much. OK now, back to work!" "It was very exciting," Sir Paul told the BBC afterwards. "It felt little bit like I was in a dream - sort of a little bit spacey." The gig was an unexpected bonus for many tourists. "We were actually just looking around Covent Garden and we had this big surprise," said Flavia, a visitor from Paraguay. "I'm so happy, I can't believe!" She wasn't concerned by the abbreviated set, saying: "Even five minutes would be OK. Any time seeing him would be OK". Covent Garden employee Harel, 37, said he was "disappointed, but not surprised," Sir Paul only played five songs. While Craig Williams, who "legged it" to the show from work said, "even for that quick 10, 15 minutes, it's all worth it". "I honestly believe the Beatles' music saved my life," he added. "There were some dark times and he's just got a 'live life to the full' mentality, and I really clicked with that." The gig came exactly a week after Sir Paul was mobbed by fans, following a pop-up show in Times Square. He said the shows had been suggested by Stella. "She said, 'what you should do is just pop up somewhere and do a gig, and everyone will just get their phones out and they'll tweet it," the star told the BBC. "And I said, 'well that's not a bad idea - however, I've now got to go and do it!'" The hit-and-run concerts echo The Beatles' final live performance, a mile down the road from Covent Garden, on the roof of their record label, Apple. That show, in January 1969, brought traffic on Savile Row to a standstill and was eventually shut down by police who ordered the band's touring manager, Mal Evans, to turn off their amplifiers. "It started to filter up from Mal that the police were complaining," Sir Paul later recalled in The Beatles Anthology. "We said, 'We're not stopping'. He said, 'The police are going to arrest you'." The star remembered replying: "Good end to the film. Let them do it. Great! That's an end: Beatles Busted on Rooftop Gig!" McCartney's latest solo album was released on Monday. Early sales data suggests the record, which was produced by Mark Ronson (Amy Winehouse) and Paul Epworth (Adele), amongst others, is likely to chart at number three this weekend. He is also due to appear on BBC One's Graham Norton show on Friday night. </body>

      <title>Tennant's Richard II rules at RSC</title>
      <description>Early reviews note David Tennant's "mesmerising" performance and "Christ-like" hair in Richard II in Stratford-upon-Avon.</description>

      <body>David Tennant's latest role sees him transformed into a king with flowing locks in the Royal Shakespeare Company's (RSC) Richard II. Early reviews have noted Tennant's "mesmerising" performance and "Christ-like" hair. Richard II is the former Doctor Who star's first RSC role since his acclaimed Hamlet five years ago. Tennant and the cast won enthusiastic applause on Thursday's opening night in Stratford-upon-Avon. The production transfers to the Barbican in London in December. It reunites Tennant with Hamlet director Gregory Doran, who is now in charge at the RSC. Starting with Richard II, Doran intends to stage each one of Shakespeare's plays once over the next six years up to 2019. Written almost entirely in verse, Richard II is a story of power and plotting in which the king's weakness and vanity threatens to drag his people into a civil war. In the cast alongside Tennant are Michael Pennington as John of Gaunt, Nigel Lindsay as Henry Bolingbroke, Oliver Ford Davies as the Duke of York and Jane Lapotaire as the Duchess of Gloucester. The play opens with a funeral lament sung live by a small choir, after which Tennant's smooth-chinned, long-haired Richard arrives in a flowing white robe, in sharp contrast to those around him in chain-mail or mourning black. In another scene he preens his rock-star locks in a mirror. "His hair takes some getting used to," notes The Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish. "Great gingery-brown extensions trail girlishly downwards. Long, magisterial, quasi-medieval robes add to the effeminate impression. "With his startled eyes and concentrated frown, Tennant is frail, pale and consistently interesting but the nervous energy he excels in is confined to quarters early on." Tennant gives a "mesmerising performance that grows in power as Richard's authority declines," according to Michael Billington in The Guardian. "The packed houses for this production's run in both Stratford and at the Barbican may have much to do with Tennant's star presence. But this is the strongest company the RSC has fielded in years." The Independent's Paul Taylor called it "another palpable hit for the Tennant/Doran collaboration". Recent star-name portrayals of Richard II include Eddie Redmayne at the Donmar Warehouse in 2011 and Ben Whishaw's Bafta-winning TV performance in the BBC's The Hollow Crown last year. Tennant told The Independent recently Richard II was a play he had loved since drama school when he saw a production with Sir Derek Jacobi. "It's quite unknowable," he said. "There are no heroes and villains in it, just people trying their best and not managing to get on with their lives." Tennant's association with the RSC goes back to 1996 when, aged 25, he played Touchstone in As You Like It. His other RSC appearances include Romeo and Juliet, The Comedy of Errors, Love's Labour's Lost and The Rivals. By the time he played the Prince of Denmark in Doran's modern-dress Hamlet in 2008, Tennant was a household name because of his lead role in Doctor Who. Tennant's last Shakespearean stage role was Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing in the West End in 2011, alongside his former Tardis companion Catherine Tate as Beatrice. He will be appearing alongside Matt Smith in the Doctor Who 50th anniversary story, The Day of the Doctor, on BBC One on 23 November. Richard II is at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until to 16 November and at the Barbican Theatre, London, from 9 December to 25 January. It will be broadcast live on 13 November to cinemas across the UK. </body>

      <title>Philomena 'to fight R rating' in US</title>

      <body>Film producer Harvey Weinstein is to appeal against a decision by US film censors to give his studio's latest film an R rating, according to reports. Philomena received the rating from the Classification and Ratings Administration for two instances of bad language. But the Weinstein Company will now officially appeal against the rating, The Hollywood Reporter said. The British Stephen Frears drama stars Dame Judi Dench and Steve Coogan. The film is based on the 2009 investigative book by BBC correspondent Martin Sixsmith about Irish-Catholic woman Philomena Lee's search for her son after being forced to put him up for adoption decades earlier. The Weinstein Company plans to release the film in the US over the Thanksgiving period next month, however it has argued the R rating will affect the number of moviegoers who could potentially watch it. The restricted R rating means people under the age of 17 may only see the film if they are accompanied by a parent or guardian. In the UK, it has been given a 12A rating by the British Board of Film Classification, where children younger than 12 years of age must be accompanied by an adult. Weinstein's studio previously became embroiled in a row with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) in 2012 over the documentary Bully over the use of bad language in the film. It opened in Los Angeles and New York without a rating, after the Weinstein Company chose to ignore the MPAA's original R rating. The studio eventually agreed to remove the language and an edited version of the film received a PG-13 rating. </body>

      <title>Flynt: Don't execute man who shot me</title>
      <description>Porn publisher Larry Flynt says he does not want the man who put him in a wheelchair to face the death penalty</description>

      <body>Porn publisher Larry Flynt has said he does not want the man who put him in a wheelchair to face the death penalty. Joseph Paul Franklin, who shot Flynt outside a Georgia court in 1978, is set for execution in Missouri in November. "I have every reason to be overjoyed with this decision, but I am not," he wrote in the Hollywood Reporter. "I would love an hour in a room with him... so I could inflict the same damage on him that he inflicted on me. But, I do not want to... see him die." White supremacist Franklin, who is being executed for killing Gerald Gordon outside a synagogue in 1977, has been convicted of a total of eight racially motivated murders across the US between 1977 and 1980. He confessed to, or was implicated in, 13 additional racial murders. No deterrent Franklin said he targeted Flynt after the publisher featured a black man and white woman in a photoshoot in Hustler, the magazine that formed the cornerstone of his adult entertainment business. "He hated blacks, he hated Jews, he hated all minorities," Flynt wrote. The entertainment mogul, who suffered permanent spinal cord damage, was left paralysed from the waist down after the shooting. The events were dramatised in the 1996 film The People vs Larry Flynt, starring Woody Harrelson and Courtney Love. "As far as the severity of punishment is concerned, to me, a life spent in a 3-by-6-foot cell is far harsher than the quick release of a lethal injection," wrote Flynt, 70, in a guest column this week. The publisher, who has never met Franklin face-to-face, says he does not believe the death penalty is a deterrent. "I have had many years in this wheelchair to think about this very topic," he wrote. "As I see it, the sole motivating factor behind the death penalty is vengeance, not justice, and I firmly believe that a government that forbids killing among its citizens should not be in the business of killing people itself." In a statement in August, Missouri attorney general Chris Koster said by setting an execution date of 20 November, the court had taken "an important step to see that justice is finally done for the victims and their families". </body>

      <title>Row over Tony Blair 'selfie' artwork</title>
      <description>Two artists complain after advertising companies refuse to allow their photo montage of Tony Blair in front of a burning Iraq oilfield on billboards.</description>

      <body>Two artists who created a montage of Tony Blair apparently taking his own photo in front of a burning oilfield in Iraq have accused advertising firms of banning the artwork from billboards. Peter Kennard and Cat Phillips created the image, titled Photo Op, in 2005. It was chosen by the Imperial War Museum North in Manchester as the image for a poster campaign to promote a new exhibition about modern art and war. But two of the UK's biggest advertising companies refused to carry the image. Photo Op combines a picture of the grinning former prime minister taking a self-portrait on a mobile phone, originally from the 2005 general election campaign, with a separate image of a blazing oilfield during the Iraq war. It has previously been exhibited at Tate Britain and was recently described by The Guardian as "the definitive work of art about the Iraq war". It is now in the Imperial War Museum North's Catalyst exhibition and the museum had intended to use it on posters and billboards. But the artists, who go by the name kennardphillips, have accused advertising companies JCDecaux and CBS Outdoor of "political censorship" in refusing to carry it. The two firms controlled between 50%-70% of the outdoor advertising market in 2011, according to a government report. CBS Outdoor said the poster was refused after consultation with the Committee of Advertising Practice, which advises firms on whether ads may breach its code of conduct. Neither gave details of which part of the code it breached, but the code includes rules forbidding ads that are misleading and are likely to cause "serious or widespread offence". Kennard and Phillips said CBS Outdoor had told them they could not use images involving explosions on public transport, such as on the sides of buses. JCDecaux declined to comment. "It feels like you're not allowed to show anything that appears dissenting," Phillips said. "You get a lot of violence and sex in adverts and a lot of offensive things, but they're not critical in their offence. They're not creating an argument or a question mark. "It feels like if you have anything that is a real show of dissent, it wouldn't be allowed to go up there and there's very little you can do about it." The Catalyst exhibition opened at the Imperial War Museum (IWM) North in Manchester on Saturday. It is the museum's first major exhibition of war-inspired contemporary art inspired created since 1991. The museum's director Graham Boxer said "a number of outdoor advertising suppliers" refused to run the proposed poster campaign. He added: "IWM North aims to inspire discussion and debate about war and conflict and as such we have remained committed to using the kennardphillipps Photo Op image across other media, including on the website, in media coverage, on social media and of course in the exhibition." A spokesman for the Advertising Standards Authority, which operates the Committee of Advertising Practice, said the ad companies "would have been mindful of the advertising rules that require ads are prepared responsibly and do not contain anything that is likely to be misleading, harmful or offensive". </body>

      <title>Veep star 'would relish' drama roles</title>
      <description>US actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, star of US sitcom Seinfeld and political satire Veep, says she "would relish" taking on more dramatic roles.</description>

      <body>Actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, star of US satire Veep, has said she "would relish" taking on more dramatic roles. "I would love to spread my wings in that direction, why not?" the multiple Emmy winner told the BBC ahead of the release of her new film Enough Said. The comedy, which had its UK premiere at this year's London Film Festival, tells of a divorcee who finds love just as her daughter is leaving for college. Louis-Dreyfus won her fourth Emmy last month for her role in Veep. Created by Armando Iannucci of The Thick of It fame, the HBO show sees her play an ineffectual US vice president whose attempts to expand her role are continually thwarted. Though ostensibly a romantic comedy, Enough Said - the fifth film by writer-director Nicole Holofcener - has "a couple of very dramatic moments" according to its 52-year-old star. "They were a great joy to do even if they were painful," the actress explained. "I hope my fans will be happily surprised." The film, which had its world premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in September and is released in the UK on Friday, sees Louis-Dreyfus appear alongside James Gandolfini. The late star of The Sopranos plays Albert, a well-meaning man unaware his massage therapist girlfriend - the character Louis-Dreyfus plays - has taken on his vindictive ex-wife as a client. "I've never done anything as deceitful in my life but I understand why she does it," said the actress, who described her co-star as a "gentle giant" and a "dear, dear man". "This is a woman on the precipice who's been emotionally hijacked by herself. The dread and fear of her daughter's impending departure fuels this horrible thing she does." The scene in which her character's deception is exposed was both "tough" and "excruciating" to film, said the New Yorker, who is currently shooting the third season of Veep - a slang term for vice president. "But it was exciting to do something so dramatic about large human emotions." </body>

      <description>Canadian pianist Anton Kuerti is taken to hospital after becoming disorientated during a recital in Florida.</description>

      <body>Canadian pianist Anton Kuerti has been taken to hospital after falling ill during a recital in Florida. According to eyewitnesses, Kuerti became disorientated and started repeatedly playing the same passage. "One of the audience members who's also a pianist actually went up to the stage to put his arm around him," said concert organiser Alan Penchansky. "He tried to find out what was wrong, and [Kuerti] started again. He simply was trapped," he told Canadian press. The fellow-musician, Santiago Rodriguez, a professor of keyboard performance at the Frost School of Music, eventually coaxed Kuerti off stage, and an intermission was called. During the intermission, Kuerti was seen by paramedics and taken to hospital by ambulance. He did not return. The Austrian-born pianist has been performing live almost all of his life - having first taken to the stage with the Boston Pops Orchestra at the age of 11. As a soloist, he has specialised in Beethoven, frequently playing the composer's entire cycle of 32 sonatas, and all five of his concertos. In 1997, US classical music magazine Fanfare called him "the best pianist currently playing", and he was an made an Officer of the Order of Canada the following year. BBC Radio 3 also named him one of the 50 Great Pianists in 2012. Now 75, he was performing at the Coral Gables Congregational Church in Miami when he was taken ill. Audience member Dorothy Hindman said the pianist "spoke intelligently and humorously" before the recital, which focussed on Beethoven's lesser-known works. He started playing Rondo in G major, Op 51, No 29 with an "exceptionally clear tone", she added, and his repetition of the closing theme was initially interpreted "as a private musical joke". But "Kuerti's growing disorientation and numerous stops and starts during the second of the Eleven Bagatelles, Op 119, signalled clearly to the large audience that something was terribly wrong". Writing in the South Florida Classical Review, Hindman said the stricken musician received a standing ovation as he left the stage. There was no further information on his condition at the time of writing. </body>

      <body>Liam Gallagher has said it was an easy decision to take part in a special concert in memory of The Charlatans' drummer Jon Brookes. Mr Brookes, 44, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour three years ago, died in August. The Charlatans will perform alongside other guests at the Royal Albert hall on Friday night in aid of The Brain Tumour Charity. Liam Gallagher described the musician as a "good lad". "He didn't have an ego, do you know what I mean? "I wouldn't claim to be his best mate and that. I only met him through the gigs we've done, but every time I met him I had a splendid time." Gallagher said he was on holiday at the time the concert was announced, but said he signed up straight away. He will be performing alongside fellow former Oasis band mates Andy Bell, Paul "Bonehead" Arthurs and Chris Sharrock, as well as Jay Mehler, currently part of Gallagher's band Beady Eye. West Midlands indie band The Charlatans said they organised the gig as a "fitting tribute" to founding member Mr Brookes, originally from Staffordshire. Keyboard player Tony Rogers said in some ways the event would be a tough night, when the reality of their friend's death "will hit home". "He was always very upbeat. His illness never got on top of him, he never let it get to him. He was always very positive and never moaned," Rogers said. "It's not like he's gone really. It's like his spirit is still there. It will be a tough one I think, but every time you think of Jon it puts a smile on your face." The Brain Tumour Charity's chairman Andy Foote said: "One of our biggest challenges is raising awareness of the disease, because the general public are not aware of the facts and they're quite startling. "For example, brain tumours kill more people under the age of 40 than any other cancer, yet less than 2% of funding that goes into cancer research goes into brain tumours." </body>

      <body>Gene Kelly film An American in Paris is being adapted for the stage and will premiere in Paris late next year. The 1951 film, notable for its score by George and Ira Gershwin, follows a GI falling in love in post-war Paris. The stage adaptation will include the famous 16-minute ballet sequence between Kelly and co-star Lesley Caron, reconceived by director and choreographer Christopher Wheeldon. The musical is expected to transfer to Broadway in 2015. The estates of the Gershwin brothers have been trying to develop a stage musical of An American in Paris for two decades, hoping to recreate the success of 1992's Tony-winning musical Crazy for You and last year's adaptation of Porgy and Bess. At their suggestion, US producer Stuart Oken and partner Van Kaplan have joined forces with Jean-Luc Choplin, of Paris' Theatre du Chatelet - where the musical will open - who was separately seeking the rights for a stage adaptation. "The Chatelet is more than a place to do the show," Mr Oken told the New York Times, "Though who wouldn't want to do An American in Paris in Paris, and to bring that feel to our show." Casting has yet to be announced. Wheeldon, a star at New York's City Ballet, previously created a ballet set to the music of the film for the company. The choreographer, who has never previously directed on Broadway, remains best known for his work on the 2002 musical adaptation Sweet Smell of Success. </body>

      <description>Former BBC director general Mark Thompson is ordered to answer parliamentary questions over the corporation's failed Digital Media Initiative, which was scrapped at a cost of £100m.</description>

      <body>Former BBC director general Mark Thompson has been ordered to answer MPs' questions over the corporation's failed Digital Media Initiative (DMI). The project, which was designed to do away with tapes and digitise the BBC's archives, was abandoned in May at a cost of £98.4m The Public Accounts Committee said on Wednesday it was "dismayed" by the collapse and would investigate further. It intends to ask Mr Thompson whether MPs were misled about the scheme. The former director general told the committee in February 2011 the DMI project was "on track" and there were "many programmes being made" with it. He also ruled out any "significant further delays" in its introduction, and added: "I think you are going to see a broader deployment of the system across the BBC than we expected, because of the enthusiasm with which it is being used". Later that month, the National Audit Office reported DMI had "progressed well" after the BBC took control of the project from technology firm Siemens. However in May this year, the entire initiative was scrapped. The BBC Trust said it had "delivered little or no assets" and should be shut down to prevent "throwing good money after bad". "This is, on a personal level, probably the most seriously embarrassing thing I've ever seen," BBC Trustee Anthony Fry told the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee in June. In a statement, Mr Thompson insisted his 2011 testimony had been given "honestly and in good faith". He added: "I did so on the basis of information provided to me at the time by the BBC executives responsible for delivering the project." No date has been set for his appearance in front of the committee, although the meeting will not take place until next year. It will be the second time he has been called to answer MPs questions since becoming chief executive of the New York Times, following his previous testimony on BBC management pay-offs in September. A spokesman for the committee said Mr Thompson was "happy to come and give evidence" again, although he may appear by video link if necessary - and that other witnesses would also be called. The BBC Trust has asked accountancy firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers to complete an independent review into the DMI failure. The National Audit Office may also compile a report next year. </body>

      <title>Arena £27m plea widely supported</title>
      <description>A bid to solve a £27m funding shortfall for the Bristol Arena is boosted by support from neighbouring councils.</description>

      <body>A bid to solve a £27m funding shortfall for the Bristol Arena has been given a major boost by neighbouring councils. City mayor George Ferguson previously requested support for a bid to cover the gap in the £90m proposal. North Somerset, South Gloucestershire and Bath and North East Somerset have said they will support the request for the money. A bid for the money will be made to the West's Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) board in December. Of the 11 board members, eight have voting power and half of those represent the four councils in the region. The LEP has already agreed to grant £25m of funding towards the project to build the 12,000-capacity arena after the government rejected a £40m bid earlier in the year. North Somerset Council's leader and LEP board member councillor Nigel Ashton said Bristol was "free to bid to for additional funding". "Any scheme will be assessed and, if approved, added to those already agreed. "We have a number of priority schemes already but we all support Bristol's ambition to build an arena." The arena is part of the city's plan to regenerate about 70 hectares (170 acres) of land surrounding Bristol Temple Meads station. Deputy mayor Geoff Gollop said he was "encouraged by the friendly response by our neighbouring authorities". He added that all four areas would "share the benefit of the wider economic impact of an arena, as well as having access to the biggest top flight bands and events currently denied us". </body>

      <title>Man Booker gets youngest winner</title>
      <description>New Zealand author Eleanor Catton becomes the youngest ever winner of the £50,000 Man Booker Prize for her novel The Luminaries, which is also the longest to win in the prize's history.</description>

      <body>New Zealand author Eleanor Catton has, at the age of 28, become the youngest ever winner of the £50,000 Man Booker Prize for her novel The Luminaries. Her 832-page tale of the 19th-century goldfields is also the longest work to win in the prize's 45-year history. "It's a dazzling work. It's a luminous work. It is vast without being sprawling," said Robert Macfarlane, chair of the judges. Catton was announced as the winner on Tuesday night at London's Guildhall. When her name was called out, "it almost seemed like the rest of the room ceased to exist," she told the BBC's World Update. Her book, a Victorian mystery tale set during the New Zealand gold rush, is intricately structured according to astrological charts - with each section exactly half the length of its predecessor. When it was shortlisted last month, the judges described it as a "Kiwi Twin Peaks". "You begin it and you think you are in the clutches of a big baggy monster," said Macfarlane on Tuesday, adding that what followed was an "accelerating, quickening tilt to the narrative". "We have returned to it three times now and we have dug into it - to use its own metaphors - and the yield it has offered at each new reading has been extraordinary," he said. The prize, announced live on the BBC News Channel, was presented this year by the Duchess of Cornwall. On receiving the award, Catton admitted that her lengthy, complex novel had been "a publisher's nightmare", saying she had been compelled to buy a bigger handbag to carry it around. She then thanked her publishers for striking the "elegant balance between making art and making money". The other authors on the shortlist were NoViolet Bulawayo, for We Need New Names; Jim Crace, for Harvest; Jhumpa Lahiri, for The Lowland; Ruth Ozeki, for A Tale for the Time Being; and Colm Toibin, for The Testament of Mary. Crace had been the bookies' favourite to win, with Catton reported to have a late surge of support over the weekend. Macfarlane said the judges' final decision had been made after "just under two hours of pretty tough discussion". Canadian-born Catton was raised in New Zealand and is the second writer from that country to win the prize. The first was Keri Hulme in 1985 with The Bone People - her first and only novel. The Luminaries is the longest ever Booker winner, beating Hilary Mantel's 672-page Wolf Hall which won in 2009. Macfarlane joked: "Those of us who didn't read it on e-readers enjoyed a full upper-body work-out." Set in 1866, The Luminaries begins with Walter Moody arriving to make his fortune on the New Zealand goldfields. He stumbles across a tense gathering of 12 local men, who have met in secret to discuss a series of unsolved crimes. Moody is then drawn into a mystery involving a missing wealthy man, a prostitute who has tried to end her life, and an enormous fortune which has been discovered in the home of a luckless drunk. Catton began writing the novel at the age of 25 and completed it when she was 27. She turned 28 last month. The previous youngest winner was Ben Okri, who was 32 when he won for The Famished Road in 1991. Kiran Desai was previously the youngest woman to win, at 35, with The Inheritance of Loss in 2006. "One can approach this as a murder mystery with seances, corpses, lawsuits and puzzles," said Macfarlane. "It does require investment… but it operates like the best kind of goldmine. You pan and then the yields are huge." Jonathan Ruppin, web editor for Foyles, said: "For those who are simply looking for a great story, the murder mystery at the heart of the book is thoroughly gripping and that alone should ensure very strong sales. "But there is so much more to it: a vivid cast of characters who leap from the page, a joyful celebration of language and some remarkable experiments with the underlying process of novel writing; critics who have dismissed it as a pastiche of 19th-century fiction have scarcely scratched the surface. "Catton is a writer of rare insight and intelligence, who is at the vanguard of the evolution of the novel. "I'm confident that she is destined to be one of the most important and influential writers of her generation." The six shortlisted writers each win £2,500 and are presented with a hand-bound edition of their book. As winner, Catton receives a further £50,000. This year marks the 45th year of the prize, which was won last year by Hilary Mantel for Bring Up the Bodies, the sequel to Wolf Hall. Next year the Man Booker Prize will be open to authors writing in English from all corners of the globe. It is currently awarded to English-language authors from the Commonwealth, including the UK, Ireland and Zimbabwe. The decision has split the literary establishment, with critics saying that American novelists will come to dominate the prize. </body>

      <title>Stoppard struggles to write play</title>
      <description>Award-winning writer Sir Tom Stoppard, 76, says he is finding it hard to remember how to write a stage play, as he attempts his first since 2006.</description>

      <body>Award-winning writer Sir Tom Stoppard, 76, has admitted struggling to remember how to write a play. He told The Times that he has found it hard to find time to focus on what will be his first stage play in seven years. "I can't just put things aside for a day and come back. My brain just isn't good enough anymore," said Sir Tom, whose career has also seen him write extensively for TV, radio and film. "I know what I want to do in the next six months. I don't know if I can." Sir Tom, whose radio play Darkside - inspired by Pink Floyd album The Dark Side of the Moon - was recently broadcast on BBC Radio 2, told the newspaper (subscription) that he was hoping to find a hideaway so that he could concentrate on writing. "When I was younger I could do something useful just by being free for half a day, but now I need five days to get the world I've left out of my head and ten days or a fortnight not talking to anyone to hold what I need to hold inside my head," he said. Sir Tom added: "I wish I could remember how to write a play. I can't remember how they happened." However the writer, who spent four years adapting Ford Madox Ford's book Parade's End for a BBC drama which aired last year, admitted taking on multiple projects could be to blame. "There are too many things I find it difficult to say no to," he said. "So I'm clearing the desk and planning to work without interruption." Sir Tom, who won an Oscar for the Shakespeare in Love screenplay he co-wrote with Marc Norman, also adapted Anna Karenina for the big screen last year. Breaking Bad He has written more than 30 plays for the stage, including The Real Thing and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, and this latest untitled project would be his first since Rock'n'Roll in 2006. It is said to tackle "the intersection of science and metaphysics". Earlier this month, Sir Tom collected this year's Pen Pinter Prize at the British Library in London. It was established in 2009 in memory of playwright Harold Pinter, to be awarded to a writer who casts an "unflinching, unswerving" gaze upon the world and shows a "fierce intellectual determination...to define the real truth of our lives and our societies". But when asked about his long-term plans, Sir Tom joked that it involved "a very protracted deathbed in which I watch Breaking Bad and all the box sets people keep talking about." </body>

      <body>Elephants have a mysterious and "tangible energy" according to South African photographer Greg Du Toit. Now after a 10 year quest, his portrayal of this "energy" has been captured in an award-winning photo. Titled "Essence of Elephants", the work has earned him the overall title in this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition. Preparation and passion, he says, were key to achieving the winning shot, taken from just over one metre away. "There was one particular day when a baby elephant raced past right in front of my camera and I was ready. I had to be prepared for that moment," said Mr Du Toit. He took the picture at a waterhole in Botswana's Northern Tuli Game Reserve from a hide (a sunken freight container) that provided a ground-level view. He had been going to the area five or six times a year for 10 years. "I chose elephants because I feel a very special energy and connection when I'm around them," he told BBC News. "But although you feel that energy it's very difficult to translate that into a camera because an elephant is such a big animal and they're not very charismatic, whereas a predator is far more charismatic." Using a very slow shutter speed on a wide angle lens "allowed all that energy to come into my camera" making him able to depict "these gentle giants in an almost ghostly way". To achieve the cool blue hue he attached a polarising filter and set his white balance to a cool temperature. The Wildlife Photographer of the Year (WPY) "means a lot to me for various reasons", said Du Toit, especially because photos were submitted anonymously, putting professionals and amateurs on an equal footing. "In my mind it's one of the last places in the world you can actually look at a wildlife photo and trust that the moment is authentic." Chair of the judging panel Jim Brandenburg said: "Greg's image immediately catapults us to African plains. This image stood out for both its technical excellence and the unique moment it captures - it is truly a once in a lifetime shot." This year's Young Wildlife Photographer of the year is 14-year-old Udayan Rao Pawar from India. His photo was of a fresh water crocodile with hatchlings on its head "kind of resembling a crown", explained Mr Pawar. He crept up on the nestling colony of gharials on the banks of the Chambal River, "When the dawn broke early in the morning I hid myself behind a rock, and when the morning light came I took those images. "I could hear them making little grunting sounds. Very soon a large female surfaced near the shore, checking on her charges. Some of the hatchlings swam to her and climbed onto her head. Perhaps it made them feel safe." Despite conservation efforts, the gharial fresh water crocodile is on the verge of extinction with an estimated 200 mating pairs remaining. "The Chambal River is the gharial's last stronghold but is threatened by illegal sand-mining and fishing", added Udayan. Wildlife photographer and Judge Tui De Roy said the composition and timing of the photograph was perfect. "The mother's gaze seems directed at you, appealing to you to let her live and thrive in peace. This image is beautiful and thought provoking, but at the same time also wonderfully playful, making it a clear winner," he said. WPY is one of the most prestigious competitions in world photography. Organised by London's Natural History Museum and BBC Wildlife Magazine, it is now in its 49th year. Images are submitted anonymously by professional and amateur photographers alike. They are selected for their creativity, artistry and technical complexity and must be submitted as a raw file with no manipulations. The winners beat 43,000 entries submitted from 96 countries. You can see more images by clicking here. Some viewers may find the last photo in the gallery distressing. The WPY exhibition opens on Friday 18 October at the Natural History Museum. </body>

      <body>American film director Michael Bay has been injured in an attack in Hong Kong while filming on the set of his latest Transformers film. Two men have been arrested on suspicion of blackmail and assault after they demanded money from the film crew, police have said. Mr Bay, 48, received injuries to the right side of his face. But he declined to seek treatment and continued filming in a busy area of Hong Kong island. A local newspaper in Hong Kong reported that three men caused what it called "a huge disturbance" to the filming of the American science-fiction film. It said that the men could have missed out on disturbance fees which the film crew paid to shop and business owners whose businesses were likely to be affected during filming. The two men approached Mr Bay on the set during filming, a police spokeswoman told Reuters. One of them demanded payment of HK$100,000 ($13,000; £8,000). As the discussion continued, the man assaulted Mr Bay and also attacked three police officers who tried to intervene, police say. The officers received treatment at hospital for minor injuries. Police also arrested a third man at the scene. There has been no comment from Mr Bay or his crew on the incident. The fourth instalment of the Transformers franchise starring Mark Wahlberg and Nicola Peltz is scheduled for public release in June 2014. Hong Kong's striking Victoria Harbour is believed to be among the film's locations, along with the city's dense and bustling streets. </body>

      <body>American character actor Ed Lauter, recently seen in the Oscar-winning The Artist, has died aged 74, it has been announced. Lauter played chauffer to the female character Peppy Miller, played by Oscar nominee actress Berenice Bejo. Publicist Edward Lozzi said Lauter died on Wednesday of mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the lung, commonly caused by asbestos exposure. He also starred in ER and opposite Burt Reynolds in 1974's The Longest Yard. Released under the title of The Mean Machine in the UK, Lauter played a sadistic prison guard whose team squares up to Reynolds' team of misfit convicts in a game of American Football. He also starred in a 2005 remake, starring Adam Sandler. The original landed him a starring role in Alfred Hitchcock's final movie Family Plot in 1976. Last year, Lauter starred with Clint Eastwood and Justin Timberlake in the baseball movie Trouble With the Curve. The actor, who started out as a stand up comic was also famed for his impersonations of movie stars. Lozzi told the Hollywood Reporter: "He called me as Clint Eastwood from the set of Trouble With the Curve last year. We really thought it was Eastwood!" He was also known to do impersonations of black and white stars James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart. Born in Long Island, New York in 1938, Lauter made his Broadway debut in the original 1968 stage production of The Great White Hope, which also starred James Earl Jones. His TV debut was came in a 1971 episode of private eye series Mannix and he made his first big screen appearance in the Western, Dirty Little Billy. Standing at 6ft 2in and prematurely bald with a long, square face, Lauter was often cast as thugs or stern authority figures. He was quoted as saying: "I like those roles. Lee Marvin once told me, 'When you play a heavy, every once in a while make the audience like you a little bit. Then they'll think, 'Wait a minute, he's not such a bad guy. Did you see the way he petted that dog?'" Lauter played the recurring character Dick Healy in the US version of Shameless and had several projects in post-production. A charitable foundation is being established to honour his work and an annual scholarship fund will be awarded to aspiring young actors. His family, which includes four children and his wife of eight years, Mia, have asked that donations be made to the foundation. </body>

      <body>US filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen have received France's highest cultural honour at a ceremony in Paris. The brothers, who won three Oscars in 2008 for their crime drama No Country For Old Men, were each made a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters. Accepting the award, Joel said: "Sometimes life plays jokes on you - some of them are very unfortunate, some of them are very fortunate. "This is one of the most fortunate jokes I think life has played on us." The award is given by the French government to people who "significantly contributed to the enrichment of the French cultural inheritance". Eight of the Coen's films have premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, with 1991's Barton Fink winning the Palme d'Or. Their latest film, Inside Llewyn Davis, also won the Grand Prize of the jury at this year's festival. Released in the UK next January and starring Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake, the film tells the story of a struggling singer-songwriter against the backdrop of the 1960s New York folk scene. French Culture Minister Aurelie Filippetti, who presented the honour to the pair, said: "We have extremely strong links between French cinema and American cinema so it's natural there's this recognition for two of the greatest directors in the US today." Other recent recipients of the honour from the world of film and music include Ringo Starr, Bono and Bruce Willis. </body>

      <title>Prisoners survives box office slump</title>
      <description>Child abduction thriller Prisoners holds on to the top spot on the UK box office chart in a weekend that saw no release make more than £1 million.</description>

      <body>Child abduction thriller Prisoners has held on to the top spot on the UK box office chart in a weekend that saw no release make more than £1 million. The Hugh Jackman movie remained the UK's number one picture for the third week in succession, despite making only £968,990 between Friday and Sunday. Its takings were almost twice that of WikiLeaks drama The Fifth Estate, which opened in a disappointing sixth place. The film made £502,495 in its first three days in UK and Ireland cinemas. Previews of animated movie Turbo, not included in this week's chart, are understood to have taken more than any title in the official Top 15. The DreamWorks release officially opens in the UK on Thursday and will have its preview takings added to its first weekend tally. The lacklustre landscape allowed Edinburgh-based musical Sunshine on Leith to claim second place in this week's chart after opening last week at three. Dexter Fletcher's film, which features songs by Scottish sibling duo The Proclaimers, took £732,296 in its second weekend on release. Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine is ranked at number three with a third weekend tally of £642,241. The film, which boasts an Oscar-tipped performance by Cate Blanchett, has now made £3.33m, making it Allen's most profitable title ever at the UK and Ireland box office. With Filth at four and Rush at five, The Fifth Estate held the dubious honour of being this week's highest new entry. This is despite a major promotional push and the presence of Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Its failure to woo UK audiences was further underlined by the performance of marital drama Le Week-End at number seven. On a screen-for-screen basis, Roger Michell's film - which stars Jim Broadbent and Lindsay Duncan as a long-married couple spending a weekend in Paris - made more than twice as much as its tech-savvy rival. Further down the chart, action sequel Machete Kills languished in 12th place with a three-day tally of £165,586. Its takings were only marginally superior to those recorded by Romeo and Juliet, an adaptation of the William Shakespeare play by Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, whose £137,448 tally saw it open outside this week's Top 15. </body>

      <title>Morrissey opens up in autobiography</title>
      <description>Former Smiths singer Morrissey uses his autobiography to criticise the legal system and music business and reveals his first full relationship came with a man when he was in his 30s.</description>

      <body>Former Smiths singer Morrissey has used his autobiography to criticise the UK legal system and music business; and revealed his first full relationship came with a man when he was in his 30s. The star was scathing about the judges in his 1990s legal battle with former bandmate Mike Joyce, describing one as the "pride of the pipsqueakery". The Smiths' record label Rough Trade, he said, had been "brutally drab". And he accused music paper NME of being out to "get Morrissey" in the 1990s. The star, who is normally protective of his private life, opened up about a relationship with Jake Walters that began in 1994. He wrote about how Walters followed him back to his house after meeting him at a restaurant and "steps inside and stays for two years". "For the first time in my life the eternal 'I' becomes 'we', as, finally, I can get on with someone," he wrote. He also revealed how he later discussed having a baby - or, as he put it, a "mewling miniature monster" - with Tina Dehgani, with whom he described having an "uncluttered commitment". Giving his version of his 1996 court battle with Joyce, who was seeking 25% of The Smiths' earnings, Morrissey accused the drummer of "constant inaccuracies and assumptions vomited out with leaden fatigue" in court. The group, one of the most revered bands in British music, split up in 1987 after five years together. The presiding judge, John Weeks, came in for particularly scathing criticism, portrayed caustically in the book as an "unsmiling Lord of the Hunt, with an immutable understanding of the world of The Smiths". "The pride of the pipsqueakery, John Weeks begins his judgment by falling flat on his face: He brilliantly announces to the world how The Smiths formed in 1992 - his judicial accuracy not to be questioned!" Morrissey wrote. Geoff Travis, who signed The Smiths to Rough Trade, was another who failed to impress Morrissey. When the singer and guitarist Johnny Marr turned up for an appointment, Morrissey claims he waved them away and refused to listen to their music until Marr "pinned him to the swivel chair". Travis, Morrissey drily noted, "would have found himself wandering from kaftan to kaftan" if it had not been for The Smiths, who the singer claimed "saved his life and made it count in the long run". The singer's bitter and long-running row with the NME began, he said, when a new editor took over and "allegedly called a staff meeting at which he has passed the command that his staff writers must now 'get Morrissey'". In 1992, the magazine questioned whether he was racist after he appeared on stage with a Union Jack. It put him on its cover under the headline: "Flying the flag or flirting with disaster?" The singer also detailed the brutality of teachers at St Mary's school in Stretford, Manchester, where each day was "Kafka-esque in its nightmare". One teacher, he recounted, "stands and stares and stands and stares" at naked boys in the shower, while another was recalled for the way he rubbed anti-inflammatory cream into the young Morrissey's wrist after he had fallen over. "At 14, I understand the meaning of the unnecessarily slow and sensual strokes, with eyes fixed to mine," Morrissey wrote. The autobiography was published on Thursday as a Penguin Classic. It had been due for release in September, but was delayed by what Morrissey described as "a last-minute content disagreement". </body>

      <description>Glee creator Ryan Murphy confirms the musical show will end after the next series.</description>

      <body>Glee creator Ryan Murphy has confirmed the musical show will end after the next series, it has been reported. Speaking at a media event in Los Angeles, Murphy said he had planned for the sixth season to revolve around the characters of Rachel and Finn. However, following the death of actor Cory Monteith, who played Finn, in July, he was forced to create a new ending, TV Line reported. He added he had penned a new finale that would be in Monteith's honour. "The final year of the show, which will be next year, was designed around Rachel and Cory/Finn's story," Murphy said. "I always knew that, I always knew how it would end. I knew what the last shot was - he was in it. I knew what the last line was - she said it to him. "So when a tragedy like that happens you sort of have to pause and figure out what you want to do, so we're figuring that out now." Murphy said he planned to pitch his new ending for the show to US network Fox later this month. "I think it's very satisfactory and kind of in [Monteith's] honour, which I love," he added. The show said goodbye to the actor in a special tribute episode broadcast in the US last week. In April this year, Fox renewed Glee for a fifth and sixth season as part of a two-season deal. It had been hinted the sixth series could be the last, however it was not confirmed at the time. </body>

      <title>South Park shut down by power cut</title>
      <description>Comedy Central is forced to repeat an old episode of the cartoon South Park after a power cut prevented this week's scheduled episode from being completed.</description>

      <body>Comedy Central was forced to repeat an old episode of South Park after a power cut prevented this week's scheduled episode from being finished. Computers at South Park Studios in Los Angeles were down for three hours on Tuesday, halting work on the episode Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers. Co-creator Trey Parker told fans "it sucks" but admitted it was inevitable. "After all these years of tempting fate by delivering the show last minute, I guess it was bound to happen," he said. It is the first time he and Matt Stone have missed one of their tight deadlines in 16 years, after famously starting each show from scratch just six days before it is due to air. Most animated TV shows are written several months in advance, but South Park's creators hope to keep the show current and fresh by working to a tight deadline. The US office of Comedy Central said in a statement on Wednesday: "From animation to rendering to editing and sound, all of their computers were down for hours and they were unable to finish episode 1704, Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers, in time for air tonight." The planned episode was replaced with a repeat of Scott Tenorman Must Die, an episode featuring British band Radiohead, which fans had voted their second favourite of all time in a poll in 2011. The team posted pictures of the blackout on the show's Twitter feed and revealed that Goth Kids 3 was now scheduled for next week. Earlier this year Parker and Stone's musical The Book of Mormon opened to rave reviews in London's West End, after a sell-out debut on Broadway. They confirmed two years ago that they would continue animating the adventures of South Park's Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman until 2016. The show recently kicked off its 17th series in the US to its highest ratings since 2011, with 4.3 million viewers tuning in across three broadcasts. The taboo-breaking animation is broadcast on Comedy Central in the UK at a week's delay and Goth Kids 3 is now expected to air on 30 October at 22:00 BST. Scott Tenorman Must Die will be broadcast in its original slot on 23 October. </body>

      <body>Living for two years in Paris changed Vincent van Gogh. He might not have realised it at the time, but as he met other artists in the French capital, he gradually moved away from his dark, sombre Dutch works - towards much brighter palettes and expressive brush work. Van Gogh's transitional story is currently being told at the Eykyn Maclean Gallery in central London - with paintings by the artist and his contemporaries on show. Take a look with gallery partner, Nicholas Maclean. Van Gogh in Paris can be seen at the Eykyn Maclean Gallery in central London, until 29 November 2013. Reservations required.

      <title>Lech Walesa: 'I only fear God, and my wife'</title>
      <description>What does the former Solidarity leader make of his biopic?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24538140</url>

      <body>In the space of a few months, Lech Walesa went from being an electrician in a Polish shipyard to one of the most famous faces in global politics. So how does he feel about the new film of his life? Early on in the biopic Walesa: Man of Hope, a character describes Lech Walesa as being "full of contradictions and surprises". Walesa, in the UK to promote the film at the London Film Festival, smiles when I quote the line back at him. "I am a man of surprises," he says. "That's why I won. I surprised the communists, I surprised Yeltsin, I surprised many presidents." And then, after a pause, he adds: "I had a lot of luck as well." Walesa: Man of Hope is acclaimed Polish director Andrzej Wajda's companion piece to his Man of Marble (1976) and Man of Iron (1981). The film charts Walesa's life from the bloody suppression of the 1970 workers' protests through to the founding of the Solidarity union in 1980, the imposition of Martial Law in 1981, and the eventual fall of communism. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 and was elected president of Poland in 1990 (although the film stops before this point). Wajda has described Wałesa as "the most difficult subject I have ever dealt with" in his 55 years of film-making. "I just don't see any other director making a movie about Lech that I would find satisfying. I have no other choice," he said in his director's statement. Although Walesa is helping to promote the biopic, he kept his distance when it was being made. "I didn't interfere and I didn't want to get involved with the film-making," he explains. "Wajda needed to finish off and underline communism." In the film, Walesa is played by Polish theatre and film actor Robert Wieckiewicz whose on-screen likeness to the moustachioed union leader is uncanny. Wieckiewicz's Walesa comes across as both a charismatic and contradictory figure. At one point his character admits: "I am a man of great internal anger." The film picks up Walesa's life story in 1970 as the communist authorities put down the workers' protests, and Wałesa is forced to sign a paper agreeing to be an informer. The following scenes showing his path to political maturity and its impact on his family life and relationship with his wife Danuta (Agnieszka Grochowska). Wieckiewicz didn't meet Walesa as preparation for the role. Their first encounter was at this year's Venice Film Festival. The actor wasn't concerned he was portraying such a well-known figure, and one who is still alive. "For me he is just a man, a worker, a husband and father. Of course he is a leader and a very smart, intelligent man and Nobel prize winner," he says. "So I approached this role in the same way as any other role. Read the script and try and capture the different levels of the character." He remembers being a teenager in 1980 and hearing about the Gdansk shipyard strike on Radio Free Europe. He went to Gdansk on holiday and recalls the "atmosphere of freedom" in the Baltic seaport city. "You could say whatever you wanted without censorship. For the first time in my life I could breath. "Walesa was like a man from Mars, a super-hero. People understood him. He was like us. " He acknowledges the post-presidential Walesa remains a controversial figure. "He is not an easy man to manage. He doesn't want to shut his mouth. He is still active in political sense. Sometimes he says something tricky. "Polish society is divided between people who still believe he is a hero and others who think he is a traitor." He adds: "In the history of the world there are a lot of people who are icons - like [Nelson] Mandela - because they did something very important for other people in the world. Walesa is, in my opinion, among them." Walesa remains enigmatic when asked what he thinks of his portrayal on the big screen. "I have no opinion. I'm going to allow the viewers to make their minds up." How hard did he find balancing his life as a family man with being a political activist? "It was very hard because I always want to be the best. I'm not sure if it worked. I was born to be number one. "I don't have regrets I didn't spend more time with my family because I've lived my life to the full and you can't look back in regret." Walesa points out there could be "another 30 films" made about his life. "This is one viewpoint, but there are many different viewpoints. This is only two hours of my 70 years. "You could make a lot more films about what happened. Time will show whether this is a good film or not." What is not in doubt from the film is in taking on the authorities, Walesa placed himself in great danger. During the arrests and interrogations, how afraid was he? "I'm a man of faith," he replies. "I only fear God, and my wife - sometimes." Walesa: Man of Hope is out in the UK on 18 October </body>

      <body>Thousands of comic fans are descending on a small Cumbrian town this weekend for an international festival. Among them will be a growing number of academics who are now taking the art form - previously regarded by many as "throwaway" - as seriously as other literature. With Batman, Superman and The Avengers dominating box offices after making the leap from the page to the big screen, comic-inspired characters have been making a comeback for years. But it is not just cinema-goers who are drawn to the exploits of cartoon creations. Academics are also taking an increasing interest in the world of comics and graphic novels. There are now thought to be about 150 comic scholars in the UK - university lecturers, PhD students and independent researchers. They are exploring how subjects such as gender, feminism, history and mental and physical health are portrayed. Dr Mel Gibson, a comic book expert at Northumbria University, said the genre had "matured" in the 1980s, mainly thanks to British writers such as Bryan Talbot, Alan Moore and Grant Morrison. "That's also when academics got involved. But it's not ivory tower stuff, it's rooted in the real world. It has practical applications," she said. Dr Gibson is one of 50 leading figures from the world of graphic novels who will be appearing at the inaugural Lakes International Comic Art Festival in Kendal from Friday until Sunday. With writers, artists and industry figures coming from as far afield as Japan, the United States and Scandinavia, the event promises to transform the picturesque Cumbrian market town. While there are still only a handful of courses across the UK dedicated solely to comics and graphic novels, Dr Gibson says they find their way into many traditional undergraduate subjects. "Some of my final-year students are looking at children's literature and as part of that they will explore comics and graphic novels," she said. "They can even be included in social work studies and paediatric nursing - Bryan Talbot's The Tale of One Bad Rat has been used by health professionals around the world dealing with people who have suffered childhood abuse. "The victims might not want to or be able to talk about their situation, but through the story they can begin a discussion. That's a valuable tool for a health worker to have in their arsenal." The Tale of One Bad Rat, written in 1994, tells the story of a girl who flees London to escape sexual abuse at the hands of her father. "That is the graphic novel I'm most proud of," said Talbot. "I still get people today writing to me to say they were abused and that the book helped them cope." The 61-year-old - a founding patron of the Lakes event - is a doyen of the comic art world. Originally from Wigan, he has lived in Sunderland for the past 15 years with his wife Mary, an academic-turned-graphic novelist, and the pair won the Costa 2012 biography prize after teaming up for Dotter of Her Father's Eyes. It was with one of the first British graphic novels, The Adventures of Luther Arkwright, that Talbot made his name in the late 1970s. A story of parallel worlds, it features several nods to the poet William Blake. More recently, 2007's Alice in Sunderland explored the links between the North East city and author Lewis Carroll, mixing myth and history along the way. In recognition of his work, Bryan was given an honorary doctorate by Sunderland University in 2009 while last year he was presented with an honorary degree of doctor of letters by Northumbria University. "Academic interest has grown over the years and I'm proud," he said. "Someone once sent me a PhD thesis they had written about Luther Arkwright and its historical elements. "When I started working in comics it was almost like working at the bottom of the artistic barrel. To most people they were only just more interesting than patterned toilet paper. "Steadily they gained credibility, but that's down to the talent of the writers and illustrators. If the novels weren't any good then no one would be taking any notice of them." Taking inspiration from the annual Angouleme International Comics Festival in France - which draws 250,000 fans - the Lakes event will feature ticketed exhibitions, workshops and panels, as well as a programme of free family-friendly events. Venues across the town will stage sessions, shops are displaying artwork by schoolchildren and college students while the town hall will even replace its Union flag with one bearing the Batman logo. Talbot's latest work, again in partnership with his wife Mary, as well as illustrator Kate Charlesworth, is Sally Heathcote: Suffragette - a tale following a maid-of-all-work and the fight for the vote in Edwardian Britain. For academics such as Dr Gibson, gender is a key area of study. "Sally Heathcote is an example of a strong central female character - something comics are now very good at," she said. "For a while it was forgotten that girls read comics, much less that they were represented within them. "In the 1960s publications such as Jackie featured comic strips, but they disappeared over a period of 20 years and those titles began to steer girls towards magazines like Cosmopolitan rather than comics, which is different to the way boys' reading patterns were shaped." For Dr Gibson the move from a niche, underground offering to graphic novels being seen by many as having mainstream educational appeal is a welcome one. "Graphic novels were once seen as throwaway, but now they are more highly valued and viewed as things which deserve space on the bookshelf." </body>

      <title>'Silver Swans' taking up ballet</title>
      <description>The pensioners who are taking ballet lessons</description>

      <body>More and more pensioners are taking up ballet, according to the Royal Academy of Dance. It is putting the phenomenon down to the popularity of TV programmes like Strictly Come Dancing. In a locker room at Scottish Ballet, a group of dancers are lacing up their ballet shoes. Only one thing marks them out from the other dancers here. These dancers are all in their 60s and 70s. Today, they are rehearsing Swan Lake. Among them is Alicia Steele. She danced when she was young. Now, nearly 80, she's back. "I went to keep fit classes, but I found them a bit boring," she says. "And I love the music with the piano. I just love it and it makes you feel a bit young again. It doesn't make you look young, but it makes you feel young inside." There's been a 70% jump in the number of adult dancers signing up for classes in recent years, according to the Royal Academy of Dance. Some, like Alicia, danced when they were young. Others are complete beginners. Their oldest ballerina is 102. Preston Clare, teacher of the Scottish Ballet's Regenerate group, says he has been astonished by the change he has seen in his older pupils. "The amazing thing with these ladies is they've grown," he says. "They've stopped slouching now and it's just fantastic to see the difference in them. "They're opening up completely and able to feel more confident in themselves." The lessons at Scottish Ballet have proved so popular, they have added extra classes, and they still have a waiting list. Ballet is good for muscles, balance and memory, but 68-year-old Alison Templeton says it is not just the physical challenge she comes for. "A number of the ladies have lost husbands this year, including myself, and the support of the other ladies is just remarkable," she says. "It does help, and it gives you a focus to go out in the week and do something." Marlene Gillespie, 71, says she absolutely loves the experience. "I can't wait to come," she says. "I love the music. I love the exercise. "We have good days, bad days, we've all been through different things. And I just think it's a wonderful way to exercise, especially for elderly people." Renee Gillespie, 75, adds: "You know you can't really do what you're asked to do but you have great fun trying. And so it's good exercise, it's great fun and it's wonderfully sociable." While some senior citizens are taking on the classics, Dr Anne Hogan, from the Royal Academy of Dance, says for others there is the more gentle option of armchair ballet. "Dance is something that can be modified to all ages and all levels of experience," she says. "In the programme recently, when we trained people to work with older learners, they went into situations in some of the care homes where you had people who had to be seated the entire class, but had a great dance class. "There's lots of movement that can be adapted to people's needs." Following the Genee, the world's biggest dance competition, held in Glasgow last month, the Royal Academy of Dance is holding a week of free ballet lessons across Scotland in January. They hope it will get even more people spend their twilight years at the barre. </body>

      <title>Real story behind Scottsboro Boys</title>
      <description>The real story behind the civil rights musical</description>

      <body>The Scottboro Boys, which opens at The Young Vic tomorrow, is a musical based on the true story of a group of black teenagers wrongly accused of rape. Their case became a milestone in the history of US civil rights - but the daughter of one of the real Scottsboro Boys mainly recalls her father's private suffering. Professor Dan Carter first published his book on the Scottsboro Boys trials as long ago as 1969, so he's become adept at summarising how the complex legal and human saga began. "One day in the spring of 1931 a group of hobos, black and white, were travelling on a train in north Alabama. A fight broke out and the train had to be stopped near the town of Scottsboro. Nine young black men - the youngest was 13 - were arrested. "But then the Deputy Sheriff realised two of the white hobos were in fact women. The young women worried they might be accused of prostitution, so they accused the black boys of having raped them. "I think anyone today who studied the evidence would conclude no rapes occurred. In any case, what happened after March 1931 took on an astonishing life of its own. What happened on the train was just a part of the story." For the rest of the 1930s, the Scottsboro Boys (as they soon became known) were front page news in America. At the first of numerous trials, eight of the nine received death sentences and some of them spent long periods on Death Row. That ultimately no one was executed was in part the doing of the Communist Party USA. The communists paid for the services of celebrated attorney Samuel Leibowitz to defend the Boys. The involvement of political radicals infuriated Alabamans - some of whom didn't much enjoy being lectured by a Jewish lawyer from New York. But Dan Carter says the party's money and organising abilities proved crucial. "Without them, some of the Scottsboro Boys would surely have gone to the electric chair." At times it seemed the Scottsboro Boys had become pawns in a protracted face-off between liberal America and the conservative (and still segregated) south. But over the years the authorities in Alabama lost faith in the evidence against the Boys, who were now men. And perhaps Alabama decided the whole thing was more trouble than it was worth, with repeated appeals to the Supreme Court in Washington. The last of the nine men walked free in 1950, almost two decades after the original charges. Clarence Norris had been paroled in 1946. Seeking a fresh start he assumed his brother's identity and moved north to New York City. He married and took jobs as a warehouseman and in sanitation. His daughter Deborah Webster remembers with absolute clarity the day her father told her and her sister about his earlier life. "I was around 14 or 15 and he was in his late 50s. I was shocked at what he told me. Shocked. "As a teenager in New York I had never heard of the Scottsboro Boys so he had to explain the whole story. But the fact my father spent years in jail for something he didn't do hurt me deeply." "I could see the hurt in his eyes too - and I will never forget it. The pain never left him. It wasn't just his freedom that was taken from him. He didn't have his family anymore and he'd had to assume someone else's identity. Who wouldn't be pained at that? But Deborah thinks ultimately the revelation helped her understand her father better. "My father was very distant. There were times he came off a little too hard. I used to always feel he had no heart at all. But, in later years, I could connect and understand where all that was coming from. It was from a real dark place." "He wasn't educated, due to his situation when he was a young man. So I would get home from school and he would ask me to read his mail to him. "I thought he was checking up on my schooling but then I realised he didn't know how to read. With all the things he went through we had modest means and we struggled a lot. We're still struggling. "But my father never spoke of any hate. He never taught us to be prejudiced and I honour him for that. That had to take a special kind of human being to not have that in his heart after all he'd been through." In 1976, Alabama governor George Wallace agreed to a full pardon for Clarence Norris. Speaking for the TV cameras, after years of lying low, Clarence Norris said he held hate for no one. He wished only that 'these other eight Boys' were around. Deborah recalls that the pardon brought her father great happiness. "He even learned how to read. I took great pride in that, to see him overcome a lot of the barriers he had to face. I will always remain proud of my father and I'm very honoured to be his daughter." Three years ago Deborah and her son Harsan were invited to the original New York production of The Scottsboro Boys. The story might not seem a natural fit for a musical - so had she hesitated? "I was in two minds at first, though I was thrilled that all these years later people are still interested in the Scottsboro Boys. But the way the play was brought across it took a lot of the harshness out of the actual story. So I could sit there and enjoy it. Music lightens the heart." Some see the Scottsboro trials as a precursor of the civil rights movement of later years. Dan Carter says one effect was an important Supreme Court judgement which made it illegal to exclude black jurors in a trial. Professor Carter has been at the forefront of those seeking a full pardon for all nine Scottsboro Boys. It's thought the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles may decide before the end of the year. "I'm pretty optimistic," says Professor Carter. "Of course everyone concerned is dead or presumed dead. But even if it's only a symbol of reconciliation and respect it's one many people would welcome profoundly." The Scottsboro Boys opens at the Young Vic 18 October.

      <title>Death home saw 'institutional abuse'</title>
      <description>Institutionalised abuse took place at Orchid View, the Crawley care home that saw 19 unexplained deaths, a coroner says.</description>

      <body>A care home where 19 residents died was riddled with "institutionalised abuse", a coroner has said. Penelope Schofield has ruled neglect contributed to five of the deaths, at Orchid View in Copthorne, near Crawley. The West Sussex coroner said the home, then run by Southern Cross, was "mismanaged and understaffed". Ms Schofield has also criticised the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which gave the home a "good" rating in 2010, a year before it closed down. A serious case review has now begun into the elderly residents' deaths. At the final day of a five-week inquest into the deaths, which were all "unexplained", Mrs Schofield said the problems at the home were from the top down and started at an early stage, but nobody did anything to address them. Orchid View has since reopened under a new name and new management. Ms Schofield said it was "disgraceful" Southern Cross was allowed to run the home in the way it was, for about two years. Referring to the CQC's rating of the home, she said: "I question how this could be the case and I question whether the inspection that did take place was fit for purpose. "It's a heartbreaking case. We all have parents who will probably need care in the latter part of their lives." Andrea Sutcliffe, the CQC's chief inspector of adult social care, said she had ordered a "root-and-branch review" of the organisation's actions in relation to Orchid View. While summing up, Ms Schofield said she had found that medical documents for resident Jean Halfpenny, 77, were falsified and that she was given too much of the blood-thinning drug warfarin. Home manager Meera Reed had earlier denied ordering staff to shred documents and filling in new forms to cover up the overdose. Continuing, the coroner said that another resident was found naked and in pain with his catheter twisted, while a family member found staff eating toast and drinking tea with their feet up. Whistleblower Lisa Martin, who first informed police of problems at Orchid View, said she felt she had no choice but to come forward. Speaking outside the inquest, she said: "I had witnessed too much poor management and care to vulnerable adults. "I couldn't live with the knowledge any longer and felt I had no choice but to tell the police." She said she knew she had done the right thing morally, but said she had not worked for two years and the case had had a huge impact on her life. Speaking of her former colleagues, she said: "They shouldn't be allowed to work in the industry." During the inquest, the coroner also said it was a cause for concern that many people who worked at Orchid View were still working in the industry. Ms Martin said when Mrs Halfpenny had to be admitted to hospital, Ms Reed looked at her forms and said: "We can't send her to hospital with those. They will shut us down." She said other forms were filled out and she was asked not to disclose the shredding of the original documents to anyone. She added that the final straw came when she was told by a nurse they had found 28 drug errors from just one night shift. She called the police who arrived the next day. Ms Schofield said that all 19 residents whose deaths were unexplained had suffered "sub-optimal" care. She said they had all died of natural causes but the deaths of 86-year-old Enid Trodden, 85-year-olds Wilfred Gardner and John Holmes, and 77-year-olds Margaret Tucker and Jean Halfpenny "had been attributed to by neglect". After the hearing, Mrs Halfpenny's daughter, Linzi Collings, said the horrific details that had emerged were beyond comprehension. She said: "How the corporate failings of Southern Cross could create these events and how such terrible standards could go unnoticed by the authorities for so long has left us baffled." She said her mother deserved to be treated with dignity and compassion, but Orchid View failed to provide her with even basic care, despite being paid a significant amount of money. Lawyers for some families have called for a public inquiry to be set up, but the coroner said she would await the outcome of the serious case review first. Ian Christian, of Irwin Mitchell solicitors, which represented seven families, said the situation at Orchid View raised questions about the quality of care provided across the industry. He said before Southern Cross closed, it had owned 752 care homes. "The evidence revealed in this inquest is deeply concerning as it shows signs of profits being put before the well-being of residents," he said. Amanda Rogers, director of adult services for West Sussex County Council, said the inquest showed a shocking example of poor care, but such examples were "isolated" and the public should "remain confident" about the levels of care in West Sussex. The CQC's Ms Sutcliffe said she was shocked at the descriptions of care at Orchid View in 2010 and 2011. She said it was "completely unacceptable" and lessons needed to be learned. She added that she would "personally oversee a root-and-branch review of our actions". Ms Sutcliffe said she had already outlined changes to how care homes would inspected, monitored and regulated in the future. </body>

      <title>SNP pledges energy bill cut post Yes</title>
      <description>Scotland's deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon unveils plans to cut energy bills by 5% a year in an independent Scotland.</description>

      <body>Scotland's deputy first minister has unveiled plans to cut energy bills by about 5% a year if the country votes for independence. Nicola Sturgeon told the SNP's conference in Perth the reduction of about £70 would be achieved by removing a number of "green" charges. She believed the measure would not be a short-term fix, but a "real and lasting cut". People in Scotland vote in an independence referendum next year. On Thursday, 18 September, 2014, they will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?" Ms Sturgeon explained that two schemes worth up to half of the green costs imposed on energy companies would be removed from the bills of consumers. The minister told the party's annual gathering: "Right now, the Scottish government invests around £80m a year on energy efficiency schemes to help meet our climate change targets and lower the costs of energy bills. "A further £120m comes from a scheme designed in Westminster, operated through energy companies and paid for by a levy on your gas and electricity bills. "It is a disjointed approach, it doesn't take account of Scottish priorities and it's not as efficient as it could be." Ms Sturgeon went on to announce that an SNP government in an independent Scotland would remove the energy saving measures and the warm home discount from energy bills. She said the current system would be replaced by a more joined-up approach with funding for fuel poverty schemes - worth up to £200m per year - coming directly from government. Ms Sturgeon added: "Independence will allow us to tackle fuel poverty much more directly, delivering Scottish solutions to Scottish problems, and ensuring that energy companies always behave in a socially responsible way to protect vulnerable customers." She insisted the energy schemes would be delivered more effectively and it would save hard-pressed consumers money. The SNP deputy leader told the conference: "We estimate that it will cut energy bills by around 5% - or £70 a year. "Not a short-term measure - but a real and lasting cut in Scottish energy bills." The minister went on to demand that the coalition government at Westminster ditch its spare room subsidy, which is described by critics as the ''bedroom tax''. But she said if it refused to act, the current Scottish government would allocate "up to £20m" for a second year to help those who have been affected. Ms Sturgeon also announced that the Holyrood administration would fund the Poverty Alliance to deliver a Living Wage Accreditation Scheme to "promote the living wage and increase the number of private companies that pay it". Turning to the issue of health, Ms Sturgeon said a UK-wide approach "would be the worst thing that could ever happen to the Scottish NHS". She added: "Westminster privatisation of the NHS is not wanted in Scotland. "Scotland's national health service is staying in public hands." Ms Sturgeon went on to warn that Westminster MPs in all the UK parties were "itching to abolish the Barnett formula and cut Scotland's share of spending". She said: "So, I say this to everyone yet to make up their mind [on independence]. Consider carefully the arguments for a Yes vote. Subject them to scrutiny and ask the tough questions. "But do not ever let anyone pull the wool over your eyes about the consequences of a No vote. "They are clear and they are real. Scotland's social security system will be dismantled; Scotland's public services and universal benefits will be under threat and Scotland's budget will be cut. "The risks of a No vote are real." Ms Sturgeon promised that the Scottish government's White Paper on independence, which is due to be published next month, would "answer all your questions". She added: "The White Paper will be Scotland's detailed guide to independence. "It will make the positive case. It will explain the process by which we will become independent and describe how our newly independent country will work. "It will set out the gains of independence for you, your family and for your community." Towards the end of her speech, Ms Sturgeon said: "The vote in 2014 is not a vote for or against the SNP. "It is a vote for or against the power to take decisions in Scotland." She insisted that an SNP government after independence would bring the mail service back into public ownership; reverse welfare reforms; protect state pensions and get rid of Trident nuclear weapons. </body>

      <body>British Muslims who speak out against extremism are being warned that they could be targeted by members of the Somali militant group al-Shabab. British Muslim commentator Mohammed Ansar said he was currently under police protection because of what he was told was a "credible threat". It comes after al-Shabab militants posted a video online which named Muslims who have criticised jihadists. Scotland Yard said it was investigating the video. The hour-long film, called The Woolwich Attack: An Eye for an Eye, is narrated by an unidentified man with a British accent. It praises the killing of the soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, south-east London, on 22 May, and includes footage of Mr Ansar and other Muslims condemning the attack. Mr Ansar said he was visited by police and given protection earlier this week. The imam and broadcaster Ajmal Masroor said he had also had a late night visit from two detectives after he was named in the film. He said police warned him they had credible evidence of a potential threat against him. But Mr Masroor told the BBC he would not be silenced and would continue to speak out against terrorism and extremism. Scotland Yard confirmed it had spoken to a number of individuals and said it was currently assessing the contents of the video. At least 67 people died when suspected al-Shabab militants stormed Kenya's Westgate shopping centre on 21 September. Al-Shabab is fighting to create an Islamic state in Somalia and is banned as a terrorist group by both the US and the UK. The Islamist group, which is believed to have between 7,000 and 9,000 fighters, controls large parts of Somalia. </body>

      <title>Biggest petrol price fall since 2008</title>
      <description>The AA says petrol prices have recorded their biggest monthly fall since 2008, taking the average cost of a litre of fuel to 132.16p.</description>

      <body>The AA says petrol prices have recorded their biggest fall since 2008, taking the average cost to 132.16p a litre. The motorists' lobby group said average petrol prices fell 5.49p a litre between mid-September and mid-October, the biggest monthly fall since prices fell 11.5p in November 2008. The price of diesel has fallen from 142.50p a litre to 139.12p. The AA said lower wholesale fuel prices had prompted the price drop, but warned that further falls were unlikely. The organisation says the recent drop in prices means the cost of filling up the tank of a small petrol car has fallen by £2.74, while a larger vehicle, such as a Ford Mondeo, would cost £3.84 less to refuel. Northern Ireland is the most expensive place for petrol, with an average pump price of £132.9p a litre, and London, the north of England, and Yorkshire and Humberside are the joint cheapest at 131.9p. Scotland is still the most expensive for diesel at 140.1p a litre, while London is the cheapest at 138.6p. Regional variations depend on whether an area is mainly urban - in which case there is more competition - or if it is mainly rural - in which case suppliers have higher transport costs and there is less competition. Overall, the AA says the UK has the seventh-highest petrol price and the second-highest diesel price in Europe. The fuel price data is supplied by the research firm Experian Catalist. The AA said further falls in petrol prices were unlikely, because of poor refinery capacity in the UK and the likely strengthening of the US dollar. The US dollar is expected to rise in value now that the standoff over the country's budget is over and oil is priced in dollars. The AA's president, Edmund King, said: "A more than £2.50-a-tank cut in petrol costs for families is a dramatic improvement on its own. But, heading into winter with cars using more fuel, the timing couldn't be better. "Alongside Asda, Sainsbury's decision to fully reflect the fall in wholesale prices has been a huge benefit for drivers and businesses. "However, the AA is also encouraged by the growing band of non-supermarket retailers challenging the pricing of other supermarkets whose prices in many places are far less generous," he added. The organisation said that the situation at the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland, where a dispute between management and unions has led to a temporary closure, had highlighted the UK's lack of refinery capacity. It urged the government to find ways to support domestic refineries. </body>

      <title>Owner of killer dogs avoids jail</title>
      <description>The court sentencing a woman for mistreating the four dogs which mauled 14-year-old Jade Anderson to death hears of the 'horrific' scene after the attack.</description>

      <body>The moment a policeman found a girl who had been mauled to death by four dogs was the most distressing sight of his life, a court has heard. Jade Anderson, 14, died on 26 March at the house in Atherton, near Wigan. Magistrates heard PC Martin Burkinshaw would "never forget" encountering a bull mastiff-type dog covered in blood. Speaking after the sentencing of dog owner Beverley Concannon, Jade's family said they were "disgusted" she had walked free with a suspended sentence. At Wigan Magistrates Court, 45-year-old Concannon was given a 16-week suspended jail term after admitting causing suffering to the four animals. Jade had been at Concannon's house in Chaucer Grove visiting a teenage friend. The judge said Concannon, who was out of the house when Jade was attacked, should have been aware of her dogs' aggression. In September, the Crown Prosecution Service ruled there was "insufficient evidence" to bring a charge of manslaughter by gross negligence against Concannon. It was also not possible to bring charges under the Dangerous Dogs Act because her animals were not banned breeds and were not out of control in a public place. Jade's mother and stepfather have campaigned for the government to tighten the laws around dangerous animal ownership. They want dog owners who fail to stop their pet attacking someone to be liable to prosecution. Speaking after Concannon's sentencing, Jade's stepfather Michael Anderson said: "I'm devastated and disgusted in the justice system. "Today was just about dangerous dogs. I think she should be held responsible for Jade. "We have got a life sentence. It has absolutely ripped us apart." During the sentencing hearing, Paul Taylor, prosecuting, read a statement from PC Burkinshaw about how the officer found Jade's body in the kitchen and all four dogs at the back door trying to get in. The statement said: "The sound of the dogs in the backyard was horrific. "I will never forget what I saw. There was a large white bull mastiff-type dog. "Its head and mouth were covered in fresh blood and it was bounding in the back yard." The hearing was told how one dog, Buddy, an American bulldog, was "stir crazy". It was kept in a cage as punishment and was not walked or trained, the court was told. The dogs were put down after the attack on Jade. District Judge Mark Hadfield told Concannon her treatment of the dogs had contributed to their state. He ordered her to pay costs and a victim surcharge totalling £165 and banned her from keeping dogs indefinitely. </body>

      <body>Sun journalist Nick Parker and a second man will be charged by police over the theft of an MP's mobile phone in 2010. Mr Parker, 52, from south-west London, is accused of one count of receiving stolen goods and one of unauthorised access to computer material. Michael Ankers, 29, from south-west London, faces one count of theft of a phone belonging to Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh. Both men will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 6 November. Gregor McGill, a lawyer at the Crown Prosecution Service, said there was insufficient evidence to charge another suspect in relation to the case. Ms McDonagh, who has represented Mitcham and Morden since 1997, had her mobile phone stolen from her car in Colliers Wood in south-west London on 17 October 2010. The accusations against Parker and Ankers bring to three the number of people charged under Operation Tuleta, a Scotland Yard investigation focused on computer hacking and other alleged privacy breaches. Operation Tuleta began in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. It is being run by the Metropolitan Police alongside Operation Elveden, which is an investigation into inappropriate payments to public officials, and Operation Weeting, the Met's phone-hacking inquiry. Mr Parker has already been charged with three counts of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office over payments to officials. The Independent Police Complaints Commission has also made three arrests under inquiries linked to the investigations. </body>

      <body>West Mercia Police is conducting a review of its investigation into a meeting between Andrew Mitchell MP and Police Federation representatives. Three senior officers have been accused of trying to discredit the former Tory chief whip. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has said there was a misconduct case to answer. The chief constables of West Mercia, Warwickshire and West Midlands Police are due to appear before MPs. They have all declined to comment ahead of their appearance before the Home Affairs Select Committee (HASC) on Wednesday. A meeting was held after a row between police officers and Mr Mitchell over words he used when he was stopped from riding a bicycle through the Downing Street gates, in September last year. A transcript of the meeting showed that, while he admitted swearing, Mr Mitchell denied using the word "pleb" or insulting the police. But afterwards three senior police officers said he had refused to elaborate on what had happened and should resign. On Tuesday, the IPCC questioned the "honesty and integrity" of the officers, and said West Mercia Police had been wrong to conclude they had no case to answer for misconduct. The Police and Crime Commissioner for Warwickshire, Ron Ball, called for West Mercia Police to conduct a review of its investigation into the specific issues raised in the IPCC's latest letter. Mr Ball said: "The media have interpreted the content of the IPCC letter alleging that senior officers intervened to change the outcome of the investigation. "Specifically, that the report had been changed from 'Case to answer' to 'No case to answer'. "That is a very serious allegation and I want to understand the exact circumstances of the investigative approval process." In a statement the Chief Constable of West Mercia Police, David Shaw, said work was being carried out to clarify the issues raised in the IPCC letter. A spokesman from the force said it was seeking legal advice as to whether the investigation will be available to the public. Association of Chief Police Officers' chairman Sir Hugh Orde has said the incident demonstrated the "critical" need for a fully independent police investigation system. </body>

      <body>A planned five-hour strike by firefighters in England and Wales has been called off, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has said. The union said the decision came after progress in talks over pensions - the strike had been due to take place from 18:30 until 23:30 BST on Saturday. The government wants firefighters to work up to 60 but the union says this is too old to be fighting fires. The FBU said it had been presented with a deal similar to that in Scotland. This means firefighters will be able to retire on a full pension between the the ages of 55 and 60 if they are genuinely not fit enough and another role cannot be found for them. A member of staff who does meet the fitness standards and chooses to retire early will get a reduced pension. A final agreement has not yet been reached because negotiations will need to take place between ministers and individual fire authorities about how this will be funded. Firefighters in Scotland voted against a strike. The FBU said 32,000 union members in England and Wales walked out for four hours when it staged a first round of action last month. Contingency plans at the 46 fire services in England and three in Wales included using part-time and volunteer firefighters, calling in non-union fire crews and bringing in private contractors. The armed forces had a back-up role and in the event of a major incident union members could have returned to work. No major incidents were reported during the strike which was the first national walkout for a decade. </body>

      <body>More than 60 parents had asked Derby City Council about moving their children out of the Al-Madinah free school before a damning Ofsted report was released, the BBC has learned. The figures pre-date the report, which said the school was failing in all areas and was "dysfunctional". Enquiries were made by 67 parents, with 33 making formal applications to put their children elsewhere. The school said it accepted the findings and would use them to move on. On Thursday, Dr Stuart Wilson, the acting head teacher, said there were serious problems at the school and accepted some of the lessons were not meeting necessary standards. The Ofsted report said teachers at Al-Madinah were inexperienced and had not been provided with proper training and that the school required special measures. Parent Razwana Bibiakbar said she would not be taking her child out of the school but added that it had let the pupils down. She said: "Something has to be done [like bringing] new leadership, new team, new staff - qualified - into Al-Madinah school to run it properly. "Why should I pull my daughter out of that school? Why can't they pull their socks up and fix everything?" The Ofsted inspection had been due to take place by the end of the year but was prioritised following initial allegations that female teachers were obliged to wear hijabs and boys and girls were segregated. David Cameron told BBC Radio Derby on Thursday that the Al-Madinah situation should not be used as a stick with which to beat the whole free school movement. </body>

      <title>Hunt highlights plight of the lonely</title>
      <description>It is a source of "national shame" that as many as 800,000 people in England are "chronically lonely", Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt says.</description>

      <body>It is a source of "national shame" that as many as 800,000 people in England are "chronically lonely", Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. In a speech, Mr Hunt highlighted the "problem of loneliness that in our busy lives we have utterly failed to confront as a society". "Some five million people say television is their main form of company," he said. Labour accused of him trying to blame families for government failures. In a speech at the National Children and Adults Services (NCAS) conference, Mr Hunt said: "Each and every lonely person has someone who could visit them and offer companionship. "A forgotten million who live amongst us - ignored to our national shame." He added: "According to the Campaign to End Loneliness, there are 800,000 people in England who are chronically lonely." He also told delegates that the 112,000 cases of alleged abuse in care homes referred by English councils in 2012-13, the majority involving over-65s, indicated that "something is badly wrong". But the regulation of care in both the private and public sector was improving, he argued. The Conservative MP said the new chief inspector of social care, Andrea Sutcliffe, would start to give ratings to care homes from April 2014, with a view to organising inspections of all 25,000 care homes by 2016. Mr Hunt said he was "particularly worried" about the 400,000 people in care homes - some of whom get regular visits, but others who were just "parked there". He said that 46% of people aged 80 or over reported feeling lonely "some of the time or often". He warned that loneliness was as "bad for you" as "smoking 15 cigarettes a day", was "worse than obesity" because of the risk of blood clots, heart disease and dementia, and warned that lonely people "drink more" and are more prone to early admission in residential or nursing care. Mr Hunt also said he believed the UK should learn from Asian cultures, where there was "reverence and respect for older people" and "residential care is a last rather than a first option". "The social contract is stronger because as children see how their own grandparents are looked after, they develop higher expectations of how they too will be treated when they get old," he explained. "If we are to tackle the challenge of an ageing society, we must learn from this - and restore and reinvigorate the social contract between generations. "And uncomfortable though it is to say it, it will only start with changes in the way we personally treat our own parents and grandparents." England should aim to become "the best place in the world to grow old in", he concluded. But Labour said the "real national shame" was "Jeremy Hunt's attempt to shift the blame for dealing with the very real problems of loneliness amongst elderly people on to families alone". Shadow health and social care minister Liz Kendall said: "He seems completely unaware that there are over six million unpaid family carers in Britain today, one in five of whom provide more than 50 hours care a week for their loved ones. "These unsung heroes save the taxpayer billions of pounds yet often get precious little support in return. "Families, friends and neighbours need a decent care system to back up their efforts to look after elderly people, but the reality is our care system is in crisis and has been pushed to the brink of collapse. "Jeremy Hunt and David Cameron need to take responsibly for their government's actions rather than trying to turn the clock back and say it's down to families alone." Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said on Twitter that Jeremy Hunt was "right to highlight isolation of older people". He added: "But he can't get away from fact that Govt cuts to care have made it much worse." But speaking on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Anthea Tinker, professor of social gerontology at King's College in London, said it was a "myth" that eastern Asian families placed greater reverence on families and older people than in the West. "The reality is that with one-child-families, children have often moved to a city or emigrated," she said. "So it's just not practical for families to depend on their children. One of the largest nursing homes in the world is about to open in China, for 5,000 people, which is amazing." Prof Tinker added: "We've got to look at the reality rather than the myth." </body>

      <title>Spare prison places fall to 800</title>
      <description>The number of spare places in prisons in England and Wales has fallen to just over 800, Ministry of Justice figures show.</description>

      <body>The number of spare places in prisons in England and Wales has fallen to just over 800, official figures have shown. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said the prison population increased by 155 to 84,987 this week while "useable operational capacity" fell to 85,828. This means there are now 841 places unfilled - last week there were 1,226 spare prison spots. The number of prisoners has fallen by 1,306 over 12 months but places have dropped even more sharply by 5,246. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the reason was the government's prison closure and modernisation programme. There was still enough spare capacity in the system for the next month or so but if the trends continued there could be a real problem approaching Christmas, he added. The current prison population comprises 81,054 men and 3,933 women. The figures published by the MoJ include immigration removal centres operated by the National Offender Management Service. The useable operational capacity - as it is termed by the prison service - is the total jail capacity minus 2,000 places. This is to take account of the necessity to separate inmates for reasons such as gender, age, security risk and geographical needs. Last month the government announced that four prisons in England were to close, as the site for a new super-prison in north Wales was revealed. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the jails in Reading, Dorchester, Blundeston and Northallerton would be shut by March next year. Feltham Young Offender Institution will also be replaced. The closures mean 1,400 prison places will be lost in England and Wales while the new £250m prison in Wrexham will add capacity for more than 2,000 inmates. The super-prison would open in four years' time if plans are approved by Wrexham Council. </body>

      <title>Woman jailed for 900 handbags theft</title>
      <description>A woman who stole more than 900 designer handbags worth up to £135,000 and sold them on eBay is jailed for 18 months.</description>

      <body>A 48-year-old woman who stole 905 designer handbags over a three-year period has been jailed for 18 months. Jayne Rand, from Swindon in Wiltshire, carried out a nationwide "campaign of shoplifting" and took handbags and purses worth up to £135,000. She was eventually caught at a shopping centre in Cwmbran, south Wales. Her haul, Newport Crown Court heard, included bags made by Mulberry, Prada, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Dior and Burberry valued at up to £200 each. Rand sold some of the bags on online auction site eBay. She is known to have made £88,000 in sales from the stolen bags but their retail value would have been closer to double that figure. On Friday, Judge Rhys Rowlands told her she had "made a business of stealing" and her actions had been "planned, calculated and persistent". "I have not seen such a case before. You travelled significant distances to steal from up and down the country and target high value bags," the judge added. The court heard how Rand, a housewife and mother of two, was able to carry out her crimes and even stole to order for some of her online buyers. Prosecutor David Wooler said: "She stole handbags from all over the country. "She targeted department stores including Debenhams, House of Fraser and John Lewis. "Her usual method of theft was to go into the store without a bag, pick up one from the display, walk around with it on her shoulder for a while, then simply walk out of the store. "Sometimes she would have to remove the security tag, but usually she wouldn't have to." But her crime spree came to an end when security staff at a shopping centre in Cwmbran caught her and alerted police. The court heard after officers began to investigate they found she had listed a significant number of handbags for sale on eBay priced competitively. "Her house was full of sealable grey delivery bags and Post Office receipts," the prosecutor told the court. "She set up a legitimate business and no one, not even her husband, knew what she was doing. "Rand told police she needed money to fund her lifestyle." She admitted stealing 905 handbags and four purses from House of Fraser and various retail businesses between December 2009 and December 2012. She also admitted converting criminal assets from 838 handbags. The court was told the cost price of the handbags was in excess of £130,000 but the prosecutor said the retail price would be much greater. In her defence, Andrew Taylor, said: "She bitterly regrets everything that she's done." "She became almost immune to the feeling of wrongdoing. "She was almost addicted to stealing high-value bags in an attempt to keep the ship afloat. "She never expected to find herself in such dire circumstances and out of desperation took this course of action." During sentencing, Judge Rhys Rowlands told Rand: "This was a remarkably serious raft of thefts which only ended when you were caught stealing a valuable handbag from a store in Cwmbran. "How you got away with it for so long without being caught was deeply remarkable. "You showed professionalism and that is why you went undetected for so long. "You travelled the country with the sole purpose of theft and you made a successful albeit dishonest business of selling stolen handbags. "The values are quite outside of what the court comes across even from professional shoplifting gangs. "It's sad and unusual to see a woman of 48 with previous good character up before the court for such a protracted and serious dishonesty. "Many, many businesses get into difficulty but most behave honestly and do not turn to this sort of crime." PC Rhodri Parry, from Gwent Police, said: "Crimes against retailers impact all of the community as it has the effect of making goods more expensive for everyone else. "We are pleased that the individual responsible for a sustained series of thefts from local retailers and those further afield has now been sentenced for her crimes. She will now be subject to a proceeds of crime inquiry." A House of Fraser spokesperson said Rand's behaviour "impacted a number of retailers across the UK". "We commend the vigilance of our Cwmbran store team who identified the woman as acting suspiciously, acted promptly and were supported by the police with her arrest," the spokesperson added. </body>

      <title>Probation officers vote to strike</title>
      <description>Probation officers in England and Wales vote overwhelmingly to strike over the government's privatisation plans.</description>

      <body>Probation officers in England and Wales have voted to strike over government privatisation plans. Private firms and charities are currently bidding for contracts worth £450m to supervise 225,000 low and medium-risk offenders each year. The probation officers' union, Napo, said there had been a 46% turn-out, with more than 80% voting yes for action. No date has been given. It warned selling off the Probation Service would boost re-offending rates. The government called the vote "disappointing" and said it would continue to engage with unions. Under the proposals, most of the Probation Service's work will be done under new payment-by-results contracts, to be awarded in 20 English regions. The whole of Wales will be one region. The contracts would mean that low and medium-risk offenders will be supervised by a mix of private firms, charities and voluntary groups. More than 700 organisations from around the world, as well as hundreds of British firms, have expressed interest in the contracts, the Ministry of Justice has said. A new public sector body, the National Probation Service, will be created to deal with the rehabilitation of 31,000 high-risk offenders each year. Napo general secretary Ian Lawrence said his organisation would pursue the mandate for industrial action "with vigour" but would also seek "to avoid this if possible by way of further negotiations with ministers". He said "decimating the award-winning public sector Probation Service and selling it off to the likes of G4S and Serco will result in increased re-offending rates, a lack of continuity in risk management, and will see the privateers making huge profits at the expense of victims, offenders and taxpayers." Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said news of the strike was "disappointing" but stressed there were "well-established contingency arrangements". "More than 600,000 offences were committed last year by those who had broken the law before, despite spending £4bn a year on prisons and probation," he said. "The public deserves better and we are committed to introducing our important reforms, which were widely consulted on. "We will continue to support staff and engage with unions as our reforms move forwards." Max Chambers, head of crime and justice at the right-leaning think-tank Policy Exchange, said industrial action was not the way forward and called for the Probation Service to "get on board" with the changes. "It's no surprise that some probation staff are worried about the future, but striking is not a very clever move and could put the public at risk," he said. "There are huge opportunities that payment-by-results can offer staff, including greater professional discretion, more freedom to innovate and the chance to have a stake in their own mutual organisations." A government-wide review of all contracts held by G4S and Serco is being conducted after it emerged the firms had overcharged the government by "tens of millions" for electronic tags for criminals. Serco has said it is "co-operating fully". G4S has said it "co-operated fully" with a previous audit started earlier this year and was conducting its own inquiry but was not aware of any indications of dishonesty or misconduct. The two firms will not be awarded any contracts until the government audit is completed, but Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has allowed them to bid for the probation service. </body>

      <title>Private rents 'hit record high'</title>
      <description>The cost of renting a home privately across England and Wales has reached a record high of £757 a month, according to a survey.</description>

      <body>The average cost of renting a home privately across England and Wales has reached a record high of £757 a month, according to a survey. Average rents rose by 2.1% in September compared with the same month a year earlier, LSL Property Services said. This was a 1.8% increase on August, driven by a 3.3% rise in the south east of England. The figures come as mortgage lenders reported another strong month in September, after a summer flurry. LSL said that greater demand from tenants was pushing up rental prices. "Higher rents in almost every region show that, despite government schemes, buying a first home is still a difficult aspiration," said David Newnes, director of LSL, which owns estate agents Reeds Rains and Your Move. "This is not only down to low salary growth, but also a general shortage of supply - which is the underlying reason why homes are getting more expensive. The long-term trend to renting therefore looks unlikely to change significantly in the near future." The government has brought forward its Help to Buy scheme, which aims to assist those who can afford mortgage payments, but struggle to raise the necessary deposit to secure a mortgage and purchase a home. However, critics have said that the scheme could create a housing market bubble, with official statistics suggesting UK house prices are already at a record high. Figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), also published on Friday, showed that mortgage lending for house purchases continued its summer strength. Gross mortgage lending in the UK stood at £16.2bn in September, slightly below lending of £16.4bn in August, but 41% higher than lending of £11.5bn in September last year. "Indicators suggest we are witnessing the strongest house purchase performance in five years. House prices too have revived but modestly, aside from a resurgent London market," said CML chief economist Bob Pannell. The LSL survey suggested that tenants' finances were stretched. Some 8.5% of all rent across England and Wales was late in September, up from 7.8% in August. However, the annual rise in rental costs was still slower than the general increase in the cost of living, with the Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation at 2.7% in September. </body>

      <body>David Cameron "agrees with the principle" of sending text messages suggesting the recipients are illegal immigrants, despite some going to the wrong people, his spokesman has said. The Home Office says just 14 people out of a total of 58,800 contacted were mistakenly asked if they had overstayed their visas. But campaigners say the true number of people wrongly contacted is far higher. Labour described the government's tactic as "shambolic and incompetent". Some people suspected of having outstayed their visas were sent a text reading: "Our records show you may not have leave to remain in the UK. Please contact us to discuss your case." The prime minister's official spokesman acknowledged that the wording of the texts had changed since the campaign began. Originally, they had included the phrase: "You are required to leave the UK as you no longer have the right to remain." The Home Office said it was "right to enforce the rules", and Mr Cameron's spokesman said: "The prime minister agrees with the principle of the texts. "It is one of various means the Home Office contacts people who may not have the right to remain in the UK." But two recipients of the texts - campaigner Suresh Grover and immigration lawyer Bobby Chan - reacted angrily to the message. "I came here with my parents in 1966, I was born in East Africa and have a British passport," Mr Grover told the Independent newspaper - adding he was "shocked" and "horrified" to be contacted in this way. Mr Chan said the texts "stereotype immigrants as a criminal community and create an atmosphere of fear". But the Home Office defended its position: "We are taking proactive steps to contact individuals who records show have no valid right to be in the UK." The individuals affected had been contacted in a variety of ways, including email and text, it added. It also denied that Mr Grover had been contacted at all. Mr Grover told the BBC he would instruct his lawyers to write to the Home Office, challenging its claim he had not received the text directly. The department has received more than 140 complaints about the campaign, although Capita said: "Most complaints occurred in the early part of the contract where Capita was, as part of the contract, updating sometimes out-of-date Home Office records." Capita believes that 4,160 people have departed the UK since December 2012 as a result as a result of being contacted, the Home Office said. Labour's shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: "Theresa May's immigration system lurches from one gimmick to another with little effect. "The reports that the government has allowed a private contractor to send British citizens text message telling them to leave the country demonstrates once more just how shambolic and incompetent the Home Office's border police is under Theresa May. "These messages will rightly cause distress and offence to British citizens, many of whom have done much to contribute to our society. It is simply wrong for this sort of message to be sent by text, and to be so poorly targeted." UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who campaigns for tighter border controls and Britain's exit from the EU, said the text message scheme was the product of a government with "absolutely zero sensibility and even less sense". "To send threatening text messages and emails to people on some sort of clearly ill-managed central database is deeply disturbing and the sort of behaviour one would expect from a fascistic police state, not a democratic and inclusive nation. Quite frankly it's abhorrent." UKIP MEP candidate Amjad Bashir said: "I find it utterly repugnant that people like me, who may have been born abroad but who are passport-holding and hard-working citizens of the UK are being threatened by the government in this way." Meanwhile, immigration minister Mark Harper has said that vans telling illegal immigrants in London to "go home or face arrest" could be deployed across the UK. He told BBC One's Question Time that the government was assessing the results of the scheme, which was piloted in the capital earlier this year. During July, they were driven around the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow for a week. Labour accused ministers of "borrowing the language" used by the National Front in the 1970s. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said the campaign had been "stupid and offensive". Earlier this month, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned the posters, saying they had misled the public about the arrest statistics displayed. However, it cleared the campaign of being offensive and irresponsible. Mr Harper told Question Time: "I don't have any problem with saying to people who are here illegally that they shouldn't be here anymore." </body>

      <title>Life sentence for human trafficking</title>
      <description>A maximum life sentence for the worst cases of human trafficking and exploitation is to be introduced.</description>

      <body>A maximum life sentence for the worst cases of human trafficking and exploitation is to be introduced. It comes after Home Secretary Theresa May said tougher sanctions would be brought in to tackle modern-day slavery earlier this year. The number of cases discovered in the UK has risen by 25% in the last year, according to government figures. Trafficking from Albania, Poland and Lithuania has seen a big rise. Ministers are planning new legislation to simplify the law on slavery, and make it easier to bring prosecutions. Victims are often targeted for sexual exploitation, construction work or begging gangs. A new report by the inter-departmental ministerial group on human trafficking has revealed that 1,186 victims were referred to the authorities in 2012, compared with 946 victims in 2011. The report revealed the largest number of victims were from Nigeria, Vietnam, Albania, Romania and China. There has been a 300% increase in Albanian trafficking, a 171% increase in victims from Lithuania, and 148% more from Poland since 2011, the report indicated. But trafficking from Romania and China had fallen, according to the figures. Victims brought to the UK are forced to do anything from work as house slaves to labour in cannabis farms. Eastern European women are most likely to be used as prostitutes, according to the report. Men are most likely to be used for construction work. There is also a trend towards forced begging, and benefit fraud - gangmasters take all the proceeds, returning very little to victims. Those targeted are often lured to the UK with the promise of free travel, a job and accommodation, sometimes by family members. An alternative is so-called 'debt bonds' where money owed must be repaid by working in the UK. Klara Skrivankova, from the Anti-Slavery International group, wants greater protection for victims - including the right to stay in the UK. "Tougher penalties and longer sentences alone do not suffice," she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. "Unless the protection of victims is put on a statutory footing, we're unlikely to see more prosecutions." Victims minister Damian Green said the trafficking of vulnerable men and women was something "no civilised country should tolerate". "On Anti-Slavery Day I am proud that this government is standing strong against those who profit from human misery and last year gave £3m to support those who have suffered at their hands." Chief constable Shaun Sawyer of the Association of Chief Police Officers said "the national approach is very much about the protection of the victim", but he added: "I agree that the signposting and signalling could be clearer". "A lot of people are prosecuted for GBH, rape, violence against the individual - it's far easier to bring the perpetrator to justice this way. This Bill will make it easier to prosecute for trafficking." David Hanson MP, Labour's shadow immigration minister, said that the government needed to focus on prosecutions, pointing to the last government report which identified 946 potential victims of human trafficking, but "only eight convictions". "The government also needs to wake up to the fact that 60% of trafficked children simply go missing again in the UK after they've come to the attention of the authorities," he added. "It should be a source of shame." In her Tory party conference speech, Mrs May said an order banning someone convicted of trafficking from being a gangmaster after their release from prison would form a key part of the new bill. </body>

      <title>Row over Tony Blair 'selfie' artwork</title>
      <description>Two artists complain after advertising companies refuse to allow their photo montage of Tony Blair in front of a burning Iraq oilfield on billboards.</description>

      <body>Two artists who created a montage of Tony Blair apparently taking his own photo in front of a burning oilfield in Iraq have accused advertising firms of banning the artwork from billboards. Peter Kennard and Cat Phillips created the image, titled Photo Op, in 2005. It was chosen by the Imperial War Museum North in Manchester as the image for a poster campaign to promote a new exhibition about modern art and war. But two of the UK's biggest advertising companies refused to carry the image. Photo Op combines a picture of the grinning former prime minister taking a self-portrait on a mobile phone, originally from the 2005 general election campaign, with a separate image of a blazing oilfield during the Iraq war. It has previously been exhibited at Tate Britain and was recently described by The Guardian as "the definitive work of art about the Iraq war". It is now in the Imperial War Museum North's Catalyst exhibition and the museum had intended to use it on posters and billboards. But the artists, who go by the name kennardphillips, have accused advertising companies JCDecaux and CBS Outdoor of "political censorship" in refusing to carry it. The two firms controlled between 50%-70% of the outdoor advertising market in 2011, according to a government report. CBS Outdoor said the poster was refused after consultation with the Committee of Advertising Practice, which advises firms on whether ads may breach its code of conduct. Neither gave details of which part of the code it breached, but the code includes rules forbidding ads that are misleading and are likely to cause "serious or widespread offence". Kennard and Phillips said CBS Outdoor had told them they could not use images involving explosions on public transport, such as on the sides of buses. JCDecaux declined to comment. "It feels like you're not allowed to show anything that appears dissenting," Phillips said. "You get a lot of violence and sex in adverts and a lot of offensive things, but they're not critical in their offence. They're not creating an argument or a question mark. "It feels like if you have anything that is a real show of dissent, it wouldn't be allowed to go up there and there's very little you can do about it." The Catalyst exhibition opened at the Imperial War Museum (IWM) North in Manchester on Saturday. It is the museum's first major exhibition of war-inspired contemporary art inspired created since 1991. The museum's director Graham Boxer said "a number of outdoor advertising suppliers" refused to run the proposed poster campaign. He added: "IWM North aims to inspire discussion and debate about war and conflict and as such we have remained committed to using the kennardphillipps Photo Op image across other media, including on the website, in media coverage, on social media and of course in the exhibition." A spokesman for the Advertising Standards Authority, which operates the Committee of Advertising Practice, said the ad companies "would have been mindful of the advertising rules that require ads are prepared responsibly and do not contain anything that is likely to be misleading, harmful or offensive". </body>

      <title>McCartney plays surprise London gig</title>
      <description>Sir Paul McCartney delivers an impromptu gig in Covent Garden during the lunchtime rush.</description>

      <body>Sir Paul McCartney has given an impromptu gig in Covent Garden during the lunchtime rush. "Good afternoon," he told that assembled crowd of more than 2,000 fans. "Welcome to Covent Garden." "We're just going to do some songs from our new album so get your phones out... As if they weren't already," he added. The 71-year-old sang four songs from his latest album, New, from a truck parked on the piazza. It follows a similar stunt in New York last week. The London gig began at 1330 BST, about an hour after Sir Paul announced it on Twitter. "I'm getting ready to pop up in Covent Garden," the former Beatle tweeted. "Oh baby!" "Alright! Busking!" he joked after taking to the stage, watched by his daughter, Stella. "This is a change from the '60s because we would just have been coming in from the clubs right now." The singer opened with his current single, also called New, and closed with the same song approximately 20 minutes later, telling the audience: "Thank you very much. OK now, back to work!" "It was very exciting," Sir Paul told the BBC afterwards. "It felt little bit like I was in a dream - sort of a little bit spacey." The gig was an unexpected bonus for many tourists. "We were actually just looking around Covent Garden and we had this big surprise," said Flavia, a visitor from Paraguay. "I'm so happy, I can't believe!" She wasn't concerned by the abbreviated set, saying: "Even five minutes would be OK. Any time seeing him would be OK". Covent Garden employee Harel, 37, said he was "disappointed, but not surprised," Sir Paul only played five songs. While Craig Williams, who "legged it" to the show from work said, "even for that quick 10, 15 minutes, it's all worth it". "I honestly believe the Beatles' music saved my life," he added. "There were some dark times and he's just got a 'live life to the full' mentality, and I really clicked with that." The gig came exactly a week after Sir Paul was mobbed by fans, following a pop-up show in Times Square. He said the shows had been suggested by Stella. "She said, 'what you should do is just pop up somewhere and do a gig, and everyone will just get their phones out and they'll tweet it," the star told the BBC. "And I said, 'well that's not a bad idea - however, I've now got to go and do it!'" The hit-and-run concerts echo The Beatles' final live performance, a mile down the road from Covent Garden, on the roof of their record label, Apple. That show, in January 1969, brought traffic on Savile Row to a standstill and was eventually shut down by police who ordered the band's touring manager, Mal Evans, to turn off their amplifiers. "It started to filter up from Mal that the police were complaining," Sir Paul later recalled in The Beatles Anthology. "We said, 'We're not stopping'. He said, 'The police are going to arrest you'." The star remembered replying: "Good end to the film. Let them do it. Great! That's an end: Beatles Busted on Rooftop Gig!" McCartney's latest solo album was released on Monday. Early sales data suggests the record, which was produced by Mark Ronson (Amy Winehouse) and Paul Epworth (Adele), amongst others, is likely to chart at number three this weekend. He is also due to appear on BBC One's Graham Norton show on Friday night. </body>

      <title>Conker 'lessons' permission sought</title>
      <description>Teachers carry out a risk assessment, seek allergy advice and ask parents' permission before teaching primary school children how to play conkers.</description>

      <body>A Cambridgeshire head teacher wrote to parents for permission to teach their children to play conkers, after realising 95% of them did not know how. John Cattermole, from Littleport Primary, said he had to carry out a risk assessment and check the game was safe for nut allergy sufferers first. Conkers is not banned in schools, but some have chosen not to allow the game citing health and safety concerns. Mr Cattermole said parents were "very supportive" and the children loved it. He said he was inspired to introduce the game after seeing children looking at conkers on the ground, but not knowing what to do with them. "We showed them how to play during assembly, which is when I realised about 95% of them had never had a game of conkers in their life," he said. In the letter to parents, Mr Cattermole wrote: "We believe [conkers] is a fun, healthy game to play. It is also good for hand/eye co-ordination and gets children talking about maths and numbers as they play. "Mr Rivett and I have been showing children how to play safely in assembly today. "We have been in touch with the Anaphylaxis Association, as we have children at school with nut allergies. They have said there is no need to worry about conkers being on a school site." Parents were asked to fill in a slip at the foot of the letter if they did not wish their children to play conkers. Mr Cattermole said the school had received "many, many supportive emails" after sending the letter and said not one of the 416 pupils' parents objected. "Educationally, playing conkers has got the children talking about numbers and counting in the playground - but really it's just fun," he said. </body>

      <title>£10m grant letter 'was misleading'</title>

      <body>A letter from a minister to a football club about a £10m grant was described as "misleading" by a senior official. Nelson McCausland wrote the letter in 2011, apparently at the request of First Minister Peter Robinson. Noting that an IFA proposal included plans for £10m for Glentoran, the then sports minister said money was agreed by the Executive and "secure". Documents obtained under freedom of information show that senior civil servants disagreed. PDF download Letter and related documents[978kb] The officials were supported by Mr McCausland's successor as sports minister, Carál Ní Chuilín of Sinn Féin, who said the funding commitment could not be upheld. In January 2011, Mr Robinson was involved in the financial rescue of the club by a mystery benefactor. According to documents, three months later he asked Mr McCausland to write to the club's chairman Terence Brannigan. The letter, sent in April 2011, stated that "the IFA proposal included plans for a £10m grant to Glentoran FC for stadium development, subject to a viable business case". Mr McCausland said the executive had made budget allocations based on the IFA proposal. He said these had been passed by the assembly and that the executive had "also agreed funding into the next budget period". However, a senior civil servant at the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure wrote an internal memo in May 2011 disputing a number of assertions that he described as "misleading" or "potentially misleading". "I do not believe the executive were agreeing a specific allocation to Glentoran as they had not been asked the question," he concluded. In October 2011, another official, the department's permanent secretary, also wrote a memo stating: "At the request of the first minister, Nelson McCausland wrote to Terence Brannigan confirming £10m funding had been earmarked for Glentoran". The letter also said Glentoran would have the opportunity to bid for up to £4m earmarked for a national training centre. She said: "It is the view of DCAL officials that these assertions may not be borne out so definitively by the executive decision." Minutes of a meeting involving the current minister, Carál Ní Chuilín, record her stating reasons why the executive would not have been in a position to be more specific about the allocation of funds. "Consequently," she concluded, "any commitments of funding given in advance of the policy development could not be upheld." She confirmed this in a statement to the BBC: "A strategy for the development of local soccer is being pursued. "A range of research and business cases will be developed in due course, including an assessment of facilities by the IFA. These will help to inform DCAL's decisions on budget bids during the next Comprehensive Spending Review." "DCAL is neither bound by, nor committed to, any notional or specific award of funding to any club's development plans at this stage." A DUP spokesman said: "The letter that Nelson sent was stating a number of facts. How people interpreted the letter is a matter for them to explain. "Details of the funding packages for the sports bodies were negotiated by ministers and a paper submitted to the executive alongside a detailed discussion held at an executive meeting. The civil servants, to whom you refer, were not present at the executive meeting or during discussions between ministers." </body>

      <body>The senior coroner for NI has warned the chief constable and the justice minister he will not allow further delays in the inquest into the death of Castlederg teenager Arlene Arkinson. John Leckey was speaking at a preliminary hearing into her death. Arlene, who was 15, went missing in August 1994 and her body has never been found. After many delays an inquest has now been set for 28 April next year at Omagh Court House. However, on Friday it emerged that less than half the documents the PSNI are due to give to the court and the Arkinson family have been handed over. A barrister blamed the delay on a busy summer, with the G8 summit, the flags dispute and the marching season. Setting a deadline for the end of this month for the handover, the coroner replied that if Chief Constable Matt Baggott did not have the necessary resources, he should ask Justice Minister David Ford for more. He also said he hoped Mr Ford would make an early decision on legal aid for Robert Howard, whom he described as a prime suspect in the murder of Arlene Arkinson. </body>

      <body>A woman has died after a house fire in Rhondda Cynon Taf in which the property had partly collapsed, said the fire service. Firefighters tackled the blaze in Abernant, Aberdare, for three hours from shortly after 07:30 BST. South Wales Police said the cause of the fire was unknown and was under investigation. The force said next of kin had been informed and were being supported "at this difficult time". "A body believed to be that of a female has been found inside the property but has not been formally identified," said South Wales Police in a statement. "Next of kin have been informed and are being supported at this difficult time. "A police cordon will remain overnight." South Wales Fire and Rescue Service officers are also investigating. Assistant chief fire officer Andy Thomas said crews had been faced with a "difficult" rescue attempt. "Despite the tremendous efforts of the fire crews, the severity of the fire and the partial collapse of the building meant crews were faced with a very difficult incident and, unfortunately, a fatality has been confirmed at the scene," he said. He added: "I would first of all like to express my sincere condolences to the family and friends of the deceased that has sadly lost their life during the house fire today." He said he could not give any further information on the identity of the person who had died. South Wales fire service said five appliances and two water bowsers had attended the scene. A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesperson said: "We were called at 7.41am to reports of a fire at a property in Aberdare. "We sent two rapid response vehicles, two emergency ambulances and the hazardous area response team to the scene, where sadly one person was pronounced dead." </body>

      <body>A former Denbigh mayor accused of causing a series of explosions in the town told a jury he "made fireworks, not bombs". John Larsen, 46, said he played no part in the explosions in the Lenten Pool area between January and April. Mr Larsen denies causing an explosion, possessing explosives and three arson attacks on cars. He told Caernarfon Crown Court he did not get a "thrill" from his alleged actions. Mr Larsen, a Liberal Democrat town councillor, denied the prosecution's claim that he created gunpowder for explosions. "No, I didn't make any of the explosions," he told prosecutor Wyn Lloyd Jones. Mr Lloyd Jones asked: "Were you getting a thrill from speaking to the newspaper?" Mr Larsen replied: "No. I was asked to speak to the newspaper." He also denied getting a thrill from appearing on television, claiming he only appeared on screen "for a couple of seconds". Mr Larsen denied setting off an improvised explosive device on 24 March near his home with ball-bearings added as shrapnel. But he has accepted experimenting with fuels for firework rockets in his garden. Mr Larsen told the court he bought chemicals for magic tricks and others for fireworks. The former stonemason, who stopped working in 2004 after injuring his back, said his hobbies were photography, fireworks and "hand magic". He told the court he performed magic shows for family and friends. But Mr Lloyd Jones suggested none of the items found at his home were related to magic or displays for children. "That's incorrect," Mr Larsen said. "I have been practising magic for a number of years." Mr Lloyd Jones went on: "You have been practising explosions for three months." "No, I haven't. I get fed up of being called a liar," Mr Larsen replied. "I didn't do the explosions." The trial continues. </body>

      <title>No deal over Grangemouth restart</title>
      <description>Management and unions at the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical plant fail to reach a deal to allow operations at the site to restart.</description>

      <body>Management and unions at the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical plant have failed to reach a deal which would see the site fired up again. Operators Ineos asked the Unite union to make a commitment to call no further industrial action this year. Unite said it would agree to this, but on the condition that Ineos would not impose its planned cuts on the workforce during the same period. The two sides held a face-to-face meeting at the plant earlier. Ineos said it would have restarted operations at the site on Friday if Unite had given the company a "no conditions, no strings attached" assurance of no further industrial action this year. However, it claimed the union had refused that offer. Calum MacLean, Ineos Grangemouth (UK) chairman, said: "Unite's response is unbelievable given how much effort has been put into securing this deal with ourselves, the Scottish and the UK governments all working hard to find a way forward. "We will now concentrate on discussing the Survival Plan with our staff during the 60-day consultation". Unite said it had already promised no strike action before Christmas but the union repeated its calls for Ineos to abandon proposed changes to staff contracts. Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scottish secretary, said: "At Acas talks earlier this week, Unite committed to conducting no industrial action ballots or industrial action before 31 December 2013. "This was on the basis that the company would not impose cuts on the workforce during the same period. Unite also proposed that these negotiations over the future of the site during this period would be held under the auspices of Acas." He added: "If the company lifts the cuts agenda that it is imposing on its workers, then our offer still stands." Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond earlier warned of a risk to the future of Grangemouth if the current stand-off continues. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, he said the longer site remained "idle and cold" the more difficult things would become. Mr Salmond met with Ineos and Unite representatives on Thursday. Ineos said shutting down the Grangemouth complex had cost the company £20m so far. The firm had put proposals over pay and pensions to workers at the complex, which has 1,400 employees and many more contractors. A letter outlining the proposed changes - which includes freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016 - was being couriered to employees on Friday. Unite claimed the company had told staff they could lose their jobs and be reemployed on poorer terms unless they agreed to give up their final salary pension, and accept pay freezes and pay cuts, by 18:00 on Monday. The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans. </body>

      <title>Pilot 'failed to spot' reduced speed</title>
      <description>Air accident investigators say a reduction in air speed that caused the fatal crash of a helicopter off Shetland was not noticed by the pilots.</description>

      <body>Air accident investigators have said a reduction in airspeed that caused the fatal crash of a helicopter off Shetland was not noticed by the pilots. Four people died when the Super Puma crashed on approach to Sumburgh Airport on 23 August. The ongoing Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) investigation has so far found no evidence of a technical fault. The investigation will now focus on the effectiveness of pilot monitoring of instruments and the training of crews. An interim report published by the AAIB said that, as the helicopter approached to within 2.3 nautical miles of the airport, the commander noted that its airspeed had reduced to 80 knots. The commander increased the collective pitch, intending to maintain the speed. But the helicopter's airspeed reduced to below 80 knots, unobserved by the crew. A short time later, there was an automated audio call of "check height", which was acknowledged by the commander, and then a comment by the co-pilot to draw the commander's attention to the airspeed. At this time, the helicopter's airspeed was only 35 knots and reducing. There was then a second automated call of "check height" followed by a "100 feet" automated call. The report stated: "At some point the commander saw the sea, but he was unable to arrest the helicopter's descent and it struck the water shortly thereafter. "The co-pilot, realising that the helicopter was about to enter the water, armed the helicopter's flotation system. "After striking the surface the helicopter rapidly inverted, but remained afloat, the flotation equipment having successfully deployed". There were 18 people on board the helicopter at the time. Sarah Darnley, 45, from Elgin, Gary McCrossan, 59, from Inverness, Duncan Munro, 46, from Bishop Auckland, and George Allison, 57, from Winchester, lost their lives in the incident. The AAIB investigators also called for a review of rescue operations in the water surrounding Sumburgh Airport. A number of lifeboats and helicopters were sent to the scene, but the report said one rescue boat supposed to leave from a slipway to the west of the airport was delayed due to tidal conditions and instead had to leave from the south of the airport. It took almost an hour to reach the crash scene. The report said: "It is recommended that the Civil Aviation Authority reviews the risks associated with the current water rescue provision for the area of sea to the west of Sumburgh Airport and take appropriate action." </body>

      <title>Taxpayers to fund Richard III row</title>

      <body>Distant relatives of Richard III will have their costs protected even if they lose a legal battle over where the monarch's remains should be reburied. The Plantagenet Alliance favours reburial in York and has won a judicial review challenging a decision to re-inter the king's bones in Leicester. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling argued in the High Court that taxpayers should not foot the bill for the review. But a judge has ruled the Alliance can have a protective costs order (PCO). Mr Justice Haddon-Cave ruled that he was satisfied that "it was, and is, appropriate, to grant a full PCO". A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: "It is unfair for taxpayers to have to fund the case being brought by the Plantagenet Alliance and we are disappointed by the court's decision on this issue. "We will now consider the judgment on this appeal and decide our next steps. "We will continue to vigorously defend our position at the main judicial review hearing. Richard's skeletal remains were discovered buried under a council car park in Leicester last year and the plan is for them to be re-interred at the city's cathedral. But the relatives claim it was the king's wish to be buried at York and have launched what the judge has described as "Wars of the Roses Part II". The Alliance is seeking a High Court judicial review and accuses the justice secretary of failing to consult properly before giving archaeologists from the University of Leicester licence to excavate and to decide where the bones should be reburied. The judge observed: "It seems that this case will be hard fought, despite entreaties, with no quarter being given on either side". </body>

      <body>The body of a four-year-old boy who was starved to death by his mother has been released for burial, nearly four years after he died. Hamzah Khan's mummified corpse was found in Bradford in 2011, almost two years after his death in December 2009. His body was released by a coroner who told his father Aftab Khan he could now "lay his son to rest". Amanda Hutton, 43, was convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence and jailed for 15 years earlier this month. During a 10-minute hearing, Coroner Professor Paul Marks told the inquest "all the relevant facts had already been ventilated via [Hutton's] court case". He then heard a summary of events from Det Insp Ian Lawrie, of West Yorkshire Police, and reviewed the evidence of medical experts before releasing the body. Turning to Mr Khan he said: "You will now be able to lay your son to rest." Alcoholic mother-of-eight Hutton also pleaded guilty to the neglect of Hamzah's five siblings, who also lived at the house and were aged between five and 13, and preventing the burial of Hamzah's body. Hutton's eldest son, Tariq Khan, 24, also admitted preventing Hamzah's burial and received a two-year jail sentence, suspended for two years. </body>

      <title>Hodgson joke a compliment - Townsend</title>
      <description>England winger Andros Townsend describes the joke Roy Hodgson told that prompted a race row as a "compliment".</description>

      <body>Andros Townsend has described Roy Hodgson's comment that prompted a race row as a "compliment". England boss Hodgson was criticised for referring to a joke about a monkey and an astronaut at half-time in Tuesday's World Cup qualifier against Poland. Hodgson was trying to encourage right-back Chris Smalling to pass to Townsend, 22, more often. "The manager just told the players to give the ball to me so that's a compliment," said the Tottenham winger. "Everyone should be focusing on England qualifying for Brazil - not on negative silly news." The joke, the exact wording of which is still unclear, revolves around an astronaut and a monkey on a space mission. The monkey performs all the tasks requested by mission control, with the punchline being that the astronaut's only role is to feed the monkey. It came during Townsend's second game for England, after he had scored on his debut in the 4-1 win over Montenegro. "It's a dream come true to play for your country," said Townsend, who was speaking to BBC Sport news correspondent Natalie Pirks at a Spurs event to highlight breast cancer awareness.  "I had the perfect debut really, scoring a goal and getting man of the match, but I couldn't let it get to me or get big-headed as we had to concentrate on the next game. "It's only now after the games are done that I've realised how big it was for the country." Hodgson said on Friday that he and the players were angry that the race row had overshadowed England's achievement in qualifying for the World Cup in Brazil next year. "Joy is short-lived in this job," he told the Daily Mail.  "The players are as angry about this as I am. "We have just had a successful period and, although I wouldn't suggest we intend to rest on our laurels, I think we have earned the right to enjoy the fruits of our labours. Instead we get this." Former Southampton and England forward Matthew Le Tissier says he is disturbed that there is somebody in the dressing room that Hodgson cannot trust. "That's not a great thing to have," Le Tissier told BBC Sport. "If the player is offended then pull Roy to one side and be a man about it. Roy is the type of guy who will have gone 'I didn't really mean any offence and I apologise'. "That would have been the end of the matter." Anti-racism campaigners Kick It Out had called for the Football Association to investigate the comments, but it considered the matter closed on Thursday after the governing body released a statement in support of Hodgson. "Roy Hodgson is a man of the highest integrity, an honourable man who is doing a great job with the England team," said FA chairman Greg Dyke. "He has fully explained to us what he said and the point he was making to the players in the dressing room at half-time on Tuesday night. He has also explained the context in which he made his remarks." However, another campaign group has sent a formal complaint to the FA in which it calls for an independent investigation into the issue. In the four-page complaint, Race for Sport, an off-shoot of the Society for Black Lawyers, says the decision to consider the matter closed is "unacceptable". It also demands "cultural intelligence" training for Hodgson and all football managers. England striker Wayne Rooney showed his support for 66-year-old Hodgson on Twitter   and via his personal website.  "To try and pin some form of label on him is absolutely ridiculous," he said. "Roy spoke to Andros straight away and he took no offence whatsoever. Hopefully that's now the end of the matter." </body>

      <body>Andy Murray says he will compete in the Australian Open only if he is "100% fit" following back surgery. The Wimbledon champion began his rehabilitation last week after a disc operation last month. Murray, 26, will miss the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London but wants to be ready for the first Grand Slam of 2014 in Melbourne in January. "I hope so, but I'm not going to come back unless I'm 100% fit. I've got a long way to go yet," said the Scot. "I've been in the swimming pool and on the bike a little bit but it's still going to be four or five weeks until I'm back on the tennis court hitting some balls. "The rehab process is pretty tedious and long and I don't want to come back too soon and have to start that process all over again. I'll only come back when I'm 100% fit and I hope that's at the beginning of the year." Murray, who received an OBE from Prince William at Buckingham Palace on Thursday, pulled out of the French Open in May because of his back problems. The world number four recovered in time to become Britain's first male Wimbledon singles' champion since 1936. His defence of the US Open ended in the quarter-finals, but he helped Great Britain beat Croatia in the Davis Cup before surgery. </body>

      <body>Arsenal thrashed Kazakh side CSHVSM-Kairat 11-1 to complete an 18-2 aggregate win and set up a Champions League meeting with Glasgow City. The hosts were 4-0 up at half-time and netted seven in 31 second-half minutes. Danielle Carter scored four goals, midfielder Kim Little a hat-trick and Jordan Nobbs two, with Ellen White and Caroline Weir also on target. Glasgow booked their place in the last 16 with a 3-1 victory over Standard Liege, 5-3 on aggregate. Arsenal boss Shelley Kerr said: "Since the draw was made, everybody in Scotland seems to have been desperate for this game to happen. "Glasgow have proved what a good side they are for a long time now and I'm not surprised they've made it though to the last 16. "It will be a tough tie for us, but we'll prepare for it as professionally as we would to face any team and we'll focus on ourselves. "The fact that I'm Scottish is not an issue. My responsibility is to manage Arsenal and I'll be trying to manage them into the last eight." Glasgow had been level at 2-2 with Liege after the first leg in Belgium and were in control from the start on their rain-drenched Petershill Park pitch. Aline Zeler turned the ball into her own net under pressure from Suzanne Mulvey as the striker chased a pass from midfielder Denise O'Sullivan. The Women's Scottish Premier League champions doubled their lead on the half-hour mark as O'Sullivan volleyed home a cross from Sarah Crilly. Crilly bagged the third goal soon after half-time with a superb 18-yard drive that flew into the roof of the net. The visitors got a consolation goal in stoppage time, Tessa Wullaert shooting home from left back Faustine Cartegnie's low cross. Glasgow head coach Eddie Woleckie Black said: "This is as good a result as we've had in Europe. "The pressure was on us here, but after criticising the team for some aspects of their play last week I couldn't fault them tonight. "It took a lot of effort, but we've beaten a very good side and it was a thoroughly deserved win." </body>

      <title>Where the penalty for miscarriage is jail</title>

      <body>El Salvador has one of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the world. A side-effect is that women who suffer miscarriages are sometimes suspected of inducing an abortion - and can even be jailed for murder. Glenda Xiomara Cruz was crippled by abdominal pain and heavy bleeding in the early hours of 30 October 2012. The 19-year-old from Puerto El Triunfo, eastern El Salvador, went to the nearest public hospital where doctors said she had lost her baby. It was the first she knew about the pregnancy as her menstrual cycle was unbroken, her weight practically unchanged, and a pregnancy test in May 2012 had been negative. Four days later she was charged with aggravated murder - intentionally murdering the 38-to-42 week foetus - at a court hearing she was too sick to attend. The hospital had reported her to the police for a suspected abortion. After two emergency operations and three weeks in hospital she was moved to Ilopango women's prison on the outskirts of the capital San Salvador. Then last month she was sentenced to 10 years in jail, the judge ruling that she should have saved the baby's life. Her lawyer, Dennis Munoz Estanley, says the legal system has an inbuilt "presumption of guilt" making it hard for women to prove their innocence. "She is yet another innocent victim of our unjust and discriminatory legal system which jails poor, young women who suffer obstetric complications for murder on the most flimsy evidence," he says. Xiomara's father describes the conviction as a "terrible injustice". He testified in court that his daughter had endured years of domestic violence at the hands of her partner. And yet the prosecution - which sought a 50-year jail term - relied heavily on this man's allegation that she had intentionally killed the foetus. Xiomara has not seen her four-year-old daughter since the miscarriage. El Salvador is one of five countries with a total ban on abortion, along with Nicaragua, Chile, Honduras and Dominican Republic. Since 1998, the law has allowed no exceptions - even if a woman is raped, her life is at risk or the foetus is severely deformed. More than 200 women were reported to the police between 2000 and 2011, of whom 129 were prosecuted and 49 convicted - 26 for murder (with sentences of 12 to 35 years) and 23 for abortion, according to research by Citizens' Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion. Seven more have been convicted since 2012. The study underlines that these women are overwhelmingly poor, unmarried and poorly educated - and they are usually denounced by public hospital staff. Not a single criminal case originated from the private health sector where thousands of abortions are believed to take place annually. Munoz has worked with 29 of the incarcerated women, helping secure the early release of eight. "Only one intentionally induced an abortion, the other 28 suffered natural obstetric complications but were jailed for murder without any direct evidence," he says. Last year when Maria Teresa Rivera suffered a miscarriage, she was sentenced to 40 years in jail for aggravated murder. Like Xiomara, Teresa, 28, had no pregnancy symptoms before sudden severe pain and bleeding, and was reported to police by the public hospital where she had sought emergency help. The scientific evidence was flimsy, according to Munoz who will soon lodge an appeal, and the prosecution relied heavily on a colleague of hers, who testified that Rivera had said she "might be" pregnant a full 11 months before the miscarriage. A textile factory worker, she was the family's only breadwinner and her eight-year-old son is now living in dire poverty with his grandmother. Cristina Quintanilla's story is different. On 24 October 2004, the 18-year-old from rural San Miguel was seven months pregnant with her second child, living with her mother in the capital to be near a hospital for the birth. Her boyfriend was working in the US, but the couple were excited buying baby clothes and saving food tokens. "Around midnight I felt an immense pain, I thought I was dying," Quintanilla says. "I was banging on the bathroom door to get my mum's attention when I felt the baby drop out. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital." Her mother called the police - a typical step for Salvadorans in an emergency, who took them to hospital. Quintanilla was given an anaesthetic, and interrogated when she came round. Then she was handcuffed to the hospital bed, charged with manslaughter and transferred to a police cell. The first judge dismissed the case, but the prosecution appealed, upgrading the charge to aggravated murder. Quintanilla was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in jail, where she was vilified as a child killer. Her son Daniel, then only four, spent four years living with his great-grandmother until Munoz succeeded in having the sentence reduced to three years. "The medical reports couldn't explain why the baby died, but the prosecutor made me out to be a criminal who could have saved my baby even though I had passed out in pain," she says. "I will never understand why they did this to me, I lost four years of my life and still don't know why I lost my baby." Morena Herrera from Citizens' Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion says these cases have had a chilling effect, with many pregnant poor women who suffer miscarriages or complications during pregnancy "too afraid to seek medical help". "I would be terrified to go a public hospital as there is no benefit of doubt given to young women, we are presumed guilty and jailed," says Bessy Ramirez, 27, from San Salvador. "We cannot even rely on health staff to put their prejudices aside and treat us confidentially." The strict abortion law has other serious human rights implications. Suicide was the most common cause of death in 2011 among 10-to-19-year-old girls, half of whom were pregnant, according to Health Ministry figures. It was also the third most common cause of maternal mortality. Earlier this year, the plight of lupus sufferer Beatriz, 22, attracted international condemnation after the Supreme Court refused to authorise an abortion, even though her life was at risk and the foetus too deformed to be viable. Beatriz's health deteriorated while the court deliberated for several months. She gave birth at 27 weeks. The baby died within hours. Individual members of the current FMLN government, particularly Health Minister Maria Isabel Rodriguez, criticised the abortion law during the controversy over Beatriz's case. But the government has made no attempt to repeal or relax the law since coming to power in 2009, as it remains popular with large parts of the conservative population, who revere the Church and pro-life religious groups such as Si a la Vida (Yes to Life). The Arena Party, which is strongly allied with the Church, is favourite to win next year's General Election. But Esther Major, Amnesty International's El Salvador expert, describes the country's abortion law as "cruel and discriminatory". "Women and girls end up in prison for being unwilling, or simply tragically unable, to carry the pregnancy to term," she says. "It makes seeking hospital treatment for complications during pregnancy, including a miscarriage, a dangerous lottery. "It cannot be in the interests of society to criminalise women and girls in this way." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Lance Armstrong, master storyteller</title>
      <description>Disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong inspired millions of fans with his story of cancer survivor turned Tour de France champion. But were his supporters too ready to believe the fairytale?</description>

      <body>To his millions of fans, American cyclist and cancer survivor Lance Armstrong was more than just a great sportsman, he was an inspiration. To the film-maker who documented his spectacular fall from grace, he was a master storyteller. But were his supporters too ready to believe the fairytale? The story of the charismatic Texan cyclist who recovered from life-threatening cancer and went on to win the Tour de France a record seven successive times was one of the greatest tales in sporting history. In 2009, Lance Armstrong attempted to write another chapter into the legend by coming out of professional retirement to compete in the Tour again at the age of 37. He granted Oscar-winning filmmaker Alex Gibney rare access to his inner circle to chronicle the comeback. For Gibney, the experience was akin to being embedded with the military in a warzone. "When you're with a group of soldiers in Iraq or Afghanistan you're going to end up feeling part of their unit," he told me. "I don't think that's necessarily wrong. The trick is how to come out of that with some broader perspective - but it's intoxicating while you're in the middle of it." Gibney admits the "them and us" mentality inside Lance Armstrong's Astana cycling team encouraged a kind of Stockholm syndrome. Anyone who questioned his repeated denials that he had used performance-enhancing drugs came to be viewed as the enemy. "I did begin to feel that some people on the outside were a bit fanatical about the subject of whether Lance had doped," he says. "You can't help but take on the vibe of the team." Through the media and in the courts, Armstrong aggressively pursued critics who continued to question whether he was riding clean. Alex Gibney watched as his subject attempted to maintain control over the powerful and lucrative myth he had constructed. "I think the truth in the mind of someone who is a master storyteller does become elastic," he suggests. "There's a moment in the film when Lance loses in Verbier to Alberto Contador (on stage 15 of the 2009 Tour de France) and he says to me 'I'm sorry I screwed up your documentary.' "I don't think that was just banter. I think that was Lance's way of saying 'you came to me to deliver the fairytale that everyone's come to believe that I can deliver and I failed. I'm not going to win. I'm not going to be first and I'm sorry.'" After Armstrong's 2009 comeback, in which he finished third, the myth began to disintegrate. Former teammates went public with allegations of drug use. The US Anti-Doping Agency accused Armstrong of running the most sophisticated and extensive doping scheme in professional sports history. He finally came clean in an interview with talk show host Oprah Winfrey last January, in which he admitted taking banned substances and undergoing prohibited blood transfusions during all of his victorious Tour de France campaigns. In earlier films such as Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room, Taxi to the Dark Side and Mea Maxima Culpa, Alex Gibney has explored the abuse of power by big businesses, the military and the Catholic Church. In his latest film, it's Armstrong's rewriting of his own personal life story, a story that inspired and gave hope to cancer patients around the world, that Gibney finds particularly difficult to accept. "It's an abuse of storytelling power," he says. "He told a story that everyone wanted to believe in too much. He knew how much everybody wanted to believe in it. "He made the lie so enormous, so all-encompassing, that he couldn't dial it back. His only choice was to go forward and make it even bigger." So he carried on cheating, winning Tour after Tour. Stripped of those seven titles, pursued by lawyers seeking to reclaim prize and sponsorship money, Lance Armstrong's reputation as a sportsman is now in ruins. He has been banned from competitive cycling for life. For Alex Gibney, Lance Armstrong's epic downfall should serve as a cautionary tale. Even heroes, he argues, need to accept their flaws. "There can be inspirational stories that are messy," he says. "Spiderman to me is a more intriguing tale than Superman because you reckon with Peter Parker's dark past and to some extent his deep-seated anger rather than the pure hero that Superman is. "When we're told stories that seem too good to be true we should say to ourselves, 'Hey, maybe this is too good to be true.'" Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>Michael Portillo has said he "misspoke" when he claimed he had heard former Conservative chief whip Andrew Mitchell say the word "pleb". Mr Mitchell resigned his post in 2012 after Downing Street police accused him of calling them plebs during a row - a word he denied having used. In a live discussion on the BBC's This Week, Mr Portillo revealed: "I have heard him use that word in private conversation - the pleb word, I mean." But he now says he got "carried away". Pressed on the This Week programme on Thursday about whether he had heard Mr Mitchell use the word, Mr Portillo said: "I think I did, but not in a bad context. "Some policeman thought: 'Ah, that's a word that people will believe that Andrew Mitchell might have used.' "But he wouldn't have used it in that context." On Friday, the former Conservative cabinet minister added: "I seem to have misspoken. I had no right to say that. "I think I got carried away in the heat of the moment. I did not mean to say it and I want to withdraw it." The former politician, who served as defence secretary under John Major, is a regular pundit on the show. Mr Mitchell admitted swearing during the September 2012 row with police officers who said he could not ride his bicycle through the main Downing Street gate. But he also maintained: "I think most people who know me know I would not use words like pleb or moron in describing anyone." The Conservative MP has claimed that the officers involved conspired against him in a bid to "toxify" his party. After a meeting with Mr Mitchell at his Sutton Coldfield constituency office in October 2012, three local representatives of the Police Federation criticised the MP for casting doubt on the Downing Street officers' version of events, said he had refused to disclose the exact words he had used in the row, and had "no option but to resign". Mr Mitchell says he has a transcript contradicting their account of the meeting. The chiefs of West Mercia, West Midlands and Warwickshire police forces concluded that no disciplinary action was needed against their officers, even though an internal investigation by West Mercia Police had initially said there was a "case to answer for misconduct". The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has said the officers who spoke to Mr Mitchell should have faced misconduct hearings, and Prime Minister David Cameron has said the MP is "owed an apology". Eight people have been arrested and bailed under Scotland Yard's investigation into the affair, including five police officers. The Crown Prosecution Service is considering whether to bring criminal charges against any of them. </body>

      <title>Cable defends Royal Mail sale price</title>
      <description>Business Secretary Vince Cable defends the 330p flotation price of Royal Mail on a day when shares in the company briefly touched £5.</description>

      <body>Business Secretary Vince Cable has defended the 330p flotation price of Royal Mail on a day when shares in the company briefly touched £5. Value for money was important, but it was "about more than just the level of proceeds received on day one" of the flotation, he said in a letter to MPs. Some big investors declined to invest in Royal Mail, while others were uneasy about possible strike action, he added. The remarks were made to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. In the letter, Mr Cable says the price was set to ensure a successful transaction, good value, the ability to sell off the remaining government stake in the business and it being able to access finance from the markets. The price range was determined using market testing which involved consulting with a core group of 20 investment institutions. It was also priced relative to comparable companies operating elsewhere in Europe. He said that the threat of industrial action by the postal workers' union was also a factor that influenced the initial price range. "There were some investors who stated that they were not willing to invest at all and many others who focused on the business and financial implications of strike action," Mr Cable said. The letter says it was the banks employed to coordinate the sale - Goldman Sachs and UBS - that recommended the 260p to 330p price range for the shares. This was also endorsed by the government's independent adviser, the investment bank Lazard. The consultation process with investors, known as "pilot fishing", revealed that there would be sufficient demand for shares at the bottom of the range, even with the threat of industrial action. A slightly lower upper end for the price range was initially recommended. That was subsequently revised upwards "following ongoing positive feedback", he said. The final 330p float price was agreed based on final demand indications. It was endorsed by Lazard. The investment bank has now been asked to appear before the BIS Select committee amid concerns that Royal Mail was sold off too cheaply. When it became clear the share offer was many times oversubscribed (20 times for the institutional offer, seven times for the retail offer) the government did consider revising the price upwards. But this was not done "based on an assessment of the composition of demand... and an assessment of where demand would taper off," Mr Cable writes. There was also a view that this would introduce an "execution risk" to the sell off. Mr Cable said the banks helping with the sell off "recommended against increasing the price range; this advice was endorsed by Lazard". The letter does not address why the current price of Royal Mail has gone so high. But its understood the government believes this is down to the scarcity of shares available. It also believes hedge funds - some from the US - may be buying at this elevated price in the belief that Royal Mail may be transformed and modernised quicker than anticipated. </body>

      <title>Lib Dems 'veer left like a trolley'</title>
      <description>Lib Dem MP Jeremy Browne, recently sacked as a Home Office minister, compares his party to a faulty shopping trolley that "defaults to the left".</description>

      <body>Lib Dem MP Jeremy Browne, who was sacked as a Home Office minister in a recent reshuffle, has compared his party to a faulty shopping trolley that "defaults to the left". In an interview with the Times, he said he had spent years trying to exert "corrective pressure" on the Lib Dems to make them a "party of government". Now they were in danger of becoming a "party of protest" again, he warned. "We must avoid facing inwards," he told the newspaper. Mr Browne had been regarded as one of Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg's closest allies before the reshuffle and a rising star within the party. He was replaced at the Home Office by fellow Lib Dem MP Norman Baker, seen as being on the left of the party. Mr Browne described his sacking as "puzzling" and "a bit painful". "I saw my role, and continue to do so, as doing everything I can to accelerate the Lib Dems' journey from a party of protest to a party of government," he said. The MP for Taunton Deane, in Somerset, continued: "If the Lib Dems look ambivalent about being in government we can hardly then complain if people assume that its successes must be down to the party that doesn't look ambivalent. "You can't be half in and half out of government. We have to avoid the trap of looking like a party that is a reluctant party of government and looking uncomfortable and that we'd be grateful to be relieved of our collective responsibilities. "There is a role in politics for stopping things you don't want to happen, but I want the greatest emphasis to be on what we have managed to achieve rather than what we have managed to prevent the Conservatives from achieving." Mr Browne was appointed a Foreign Office minister when the Lib Dem/Tory coalition government was formed in 2010 and was moved to the Home Office in 2012. At the Lib Dem conference in September, he accused the Liberal Democrats of being "uncomfortable" with wealth creation and always wanting "to demonstrate our disapproval of people becoming wealthy and successful and creating jobs in our economy". He also called for a debate on whether Muslim girls should be banned from wearing full-face veils in some public places. He ruled out defecting to the Conservative Party in his Times interview, saying he had turned down the offer of a meeting with Tory chairman Grant Shapps. He told the newspaper he planned to fight the next election as a Liberal Democrat. "I had no intention or desire to defect to the Conservatives," he added. </body>

      <body>This week at Westminster has been dominated by one topic: energy prices. It is a case study of the biggest theme in politics at the moment, the cost of living. With British Gas joining energy provider SSE in hiking its prices, what are people feeling the squeeze and fearing the cold supposed to do? Enter, stage left, the humble jumper. And welcome to a brief snapshot of how headlines sometimes appear despite what might have emerged out of the lips of politicians and their advisers. Energy Secretary Ed Davey spent much of Thursday touring TV and radio studios criticising British Gas and suggesting people should shop around for the best energy deal. In an interview on the BBC's Newsnight, he was asked about what happened in the Davey household. Did Mr Davey, presenter Jeremy Paxman asked, wear a jumper? "I am sure people do wear jumpers, I wear jumpers at home, but you are missing the point here Jeremy, we do need to help people with their bills, I am extremely worried about them, we can use competition the way we have, we can make our homes warmer and use less electricity and gas by going more energy efficient," said Mr Davey. Cue headlines suggesting the energy secretary said wear a jumper. Great story. Except he didn't say this. Mr Davey was asked about jumpers. Mr Davey mentioned jumpers. But Mr Davey didn't say you or I should wear a jumper. Fast forward 12 hours to Friday's briefing for Westminster journalists, which is conducted by one of the prime minister's official spokesmen. The Daily Mirror - which is no fan of the coalition government - chased this theme with some vigour. The clear aim of the questions was to attempt to get an answer along the lines of "the prime minister tells you to wear jumper". If he'd said that, I'd have been jumping at the chance to get on the television, radio and online to tell it. But he didn't. Here is the exchange, as I scribbled it in my notebook: Reporter: "Does the prime minister wear a jumper at home?" Official Spokesman: "The prime minister doesn't tend to give fashion tips." Several further questions along the same lines came along, which didn't get very far. The spokesman was then asked about what the PM thought of charities giving advice that perhaps people should consider wrapping up warm. Here was the response: "Clearly, he is not going to prescribe necessarily the actions individuals should take about that. But if people are giving that advice, that is something that people may wish to consider." Next came the headlines claiming the prime minister was suggesting people should wear a jumper. Great story. Except the spokesman did not say this. Labour leapt at the chance to have their say, claiming Downing Street was in chaos and offering Ed Miliband for interview. Downing Street then issued a statement: "To be clear, it is entirely false to suggest the Prime Minister would advise people they should wear jumpers to stay warm. Any suggestion to the contrary is mischief-making." And so concludes the story of a story which isn't really a story at all. </body>

      <title>'Super fertile' Frankel earns millions at stud</title>
      <description>Frankel earns five times his race winnings in first year of breeding</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/horse-racing/24513068</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70562000/jpg/_70562786_pa-13544385.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Unbeaten Frankel's achievements on the racecourse were legendary - but his new breeding career has already easily surpassed what he earned on the track. One year on from the final triumph of his glorious 14-race winning run, the world's top-rated racehorse is now a stallion who commands a fee of up to £125,000 a time. By the end of his first year at stud, he will have earned about £15m - five times his total prize money from racing. And like any sought-after male escort, he comes with rave reviews - "super fertile", "alpha male", "thorough gentleman". He boasts a strike rate not far off his 100% record on the track - 126 of the 133 mares who visited him are expecting foals in the first part of next year. Six of the remaining seven were pregnant before suffering early foetal deaths although a "no-foal, no-fee arrangement" usually applies. Some of the healthy potential future equine stars will be bought at public sales in December before they are even born. "Frankel has started very positively. His libido is good, and a 95% success rate for a first season stallion is very good," said Lord "Teddy" Grimthorpe, racing manager to owner Prince Khalid Abdulla. The Saudi prince retired Frankel, trained by Sir Henry Cecil, after a rapturous reception in the winner's enclosure at Ascot racecourse on British Champions Day a year ago. In the next five months the colt, now aged five, was prepared for a stallion career, which started on Valentine's Day. While his diet and regime changed ahead of his new duties, his fitness was maintained by being taken on daily seven-mile walks around Banstead Manor Stud, owned by the prince's Juddmonte Farms breeding operation. Frankel was back at his birthplace when he moved from Warren Place training yard on the edge of Newmarket, where the Cecil family flag was raised after each Group One victory, to the stud about five miles away. He has other stallions for neighbours and lives in box number two. Well, even he can't be number one all the time. From that first Valentine with the mare Midday, he has bred with some of the finest mares around in a building the size of a small village hall officially called the covering shed and nicknamed the "love shack". "Frankel has been a true gentleman throughout the season," said Juddmonte general manager Philip Mitchell. On a tour of the impeccably kept stud, staff describe the horse as "super fertile". Of his first 133 matings, 113 were the winners of races, including 38 who had scored at Group or Grade One level. Their average age, of 10, is twice his own. At the peak of his powers, he was on duty three times a day - at 7.30am, 3pm and 9pm. The first fruits of this labour of love will be on sale in December when 11 pregnant mares who visited Frankel earlier in the year go to Tattersalls horse sales in Newmarket. "We expect it to generate an enormous amount of interest and competition from breeders and owners who wish to buy into the legend that is Frankel," said Jimmy George, Tattersalls marketing director. While nothing is certain in this field, and not all great racehorses become stars at stud, bloodlines are crucial in producing future champions. "Dancing Rain, who won the Oaks in 2011, will be coming through our December sale carrying a first foal by Frankel. Even for us, that's a 'wow'," said George. "It is the ultimate package, an outstanding mare in foal to the best racehorse we've ever seen. There's no guarantees, but in thoroughbred racing, it's hard to beat that." With powerful bloodstock empires from Qatar, Ireland and Dubai among those pitting their financial muscles against each other at such sales, you might struggle to remember times are tough. Two unraced yearlings fetched a combined total of more than £8m as records tumbled during bidding earlier in October. When Frankel's offspring, or progeny as they are known in breeding circles, enter the sales ring next December, buyers will be seeking his hallmarks. "The expression used in the game is to stamp their stock. People will be looking to see Frankel in the make and shape of those foals," said George. What is it, then, that marks Frankel out as a unique thoroughbred? "You certainly know when he's in the room," jokes Grimthorpe. "He's an alpha male, no doubt about that." Grimthorpe, who was a close friend of Cecil and can casually reel off each of the great horse's victories if requested, said he had always been extremely willing to race. Frankel was even something of a tearaway as a youngster, before his exuberance was channelled expertly by the tender touch of 10-time champion trainer Cecil. "His cruising speed was equivalent to a lot of horses going flat out, and he had an incredible stride on him," said Grimthorpe. "You can see when horses were trying to match strides, they had to take one-and-a-half strides to his one. "If you look at his form, it was always franked. Horses beaten by him went on to win decent races." He is the son of 2001 Epsom Derby winner Galileo - now a prolific sire himself - and grandson of champion stallion Sadler's Wells, Frankel was champion aged two, three, and four. Those 14 victories included 10 at the highest Group One level, nine of which he won on the trot. And some at an apparent canter. He was victorious in his Champion Stakes swansong despite facing Cirrus Des Aigles, the second top-rated horse in the world, on soft ground which played much more to his opponent's strengths. Little wonder then that despite his lofty stud fee, Frankel was oversubscribed, with more than 220 potential suitors from around the world. Autumn brings about 30 mares from the southern hemisphere, including Australia, before a rest between November and February. He completed his first set of bookings in June at around the time Cecil died after a six-year battle with cancer. After the horse retired, the seriously ill Cecil would make weekly visits to see his one-time stable star at stud. The trainer may have sadly gone, but his champion racehorse's legacy is set to go on. It all has a touch of Hollywood about it. The horse named after one training legend who helped another achieve the highlight of a racing life in the sickness-ravaged twilight of his career. "The only way I can describe it is as an alignment of the stars. If you wrote the story as fiction, it would be rejected on the grounds it sounded like a fairytale," said Grimthorpe. With a standard 11-month pregnancy for mares, the first of Frankel's offspring will arrive in the early months of 2014. They will grace the track as two-year-olds in the summer of 2016, when Frankel's name will appear in racecards as the sire of a new generation of equine talent. </body>

      <title>London Mayor Boris Johnson sparks Chinese interest</title>
      <description>Boris Johnson wins Chinese fans on six-day tour</description>

      <body>Boris Johnson rode a rental bicycle through crowds of admirers, travelled on the Beijing subway and made a speech which mentioned Harry Potter, Downton Abbey and James Bond. Along the way, the mayor of London managed to impress legions of young fans in China. Mr Johnson is wrapping up a six-day tour of China, which is happening at the same time as a trade mission headed by UK Chancellor George Osborne. Mr Johnson appears to be the more popular of the two politicians in China. The mayor's visit sparked thousands of comments on Weibo, China's version of Twitter. Few posted similar remarks about Mr Osborne, the mayor's Conservative Party rival. "[Mr Johnson] is a little bit special," says 19-year-old Song Yige, a second year law student at Peking University, who was in the audience to watch speeches by both men. "Politicians in China, they're like the chancellor. They're very calm and composed. But the mayor, he is very humorous. He is not distant like other politicians." Weibo users were slightly less reserved in their admiration of Mr Johnson. "I like your fluffy hair," one user wrote in English. "If you get bald someday in the future, will you put a wig? What colour will you like to choose?" "I simply want to know how to move to London without breaking any law? PS: I am poor!!! PPS: we all love you!! XOXO!" wrote another. The mayor's Beijing subway ride was particularly impressive, Ms Song says. "It's like some fresh air to China because we have never seen that before." Chinese leaders have been criticised in the past for their reluctance to use public transport, preferring instead to travel in chauffeur-driven cars. However, China's leaders are starting to use the same populist approaches as Boris Johnson, says Wang Zhanpeng, director of the British Studies Centre at the Beijing Foreign Studies University. "Chinese leaders weren't doing things like this as much in the past, but now there are some changes," Mr Wang says. "There are also more cases of leaders demonstrating their man-of-the-people approach and their personalities, although our leaders would do it more often on occasions like disaster relief." Sina, a top Chinese web portal, hosted a web page this week titled "Ask Boris Johnson", in which the mayor answered questions on his love of bicycling and expected upgrades to London's underground system. Most comments and questions asked Mr Johnson for his experience running a city like London, asking for tips on how he might improve vast Chinese cities like Beijing. "Our nation's officials, please learn from others," one Weibo user said. </body>

      <body>Hundreds of Syrians say they are stuck in the French port of Calais waiting to claim asylum in the UK. Some have staged sit-ins, gone on hunger strike or even threatened to kill themselves if they are not allowed to cross the Channel. An estimated 2.1 million people have so far fled the fighting in Syria. The UN says more than 100,000 people have died so far in the civil war, which has been raging for more than two and a half years. Ahmed and Ali told BBC Radio 5 live why they wanted to come to Britain: "Britain would provide us with shelter. France gives us nothing. "Britain will give you a house straight away." When asked how he knew that, Ahmed said: "We know. Our friend is there, lives there, we get phone calls." Did he know people who have done that already? "Yeah, a lot of people - they've crossed that border by the lorry." The deputy mayor of Calais, Philippe Mignonet, speaking to BBC Radio 5 live's Victoria Derbyshire programme, said Britain was a target for Syrian refugees because it was regarded as a "paradise" for people trying to start new lives. "The only thing they want is not to stay in France but to go to England - it's because of the mafia. "In their original countries those people are saying if you go to England you will have everything - you will have a house, you will have money, you will have a job, your family will be able to join you. Right or wrong, it is what is said. "We have now in Europe to understand that and to fight against those mafias." He says mafia gangs are operating in his town and charge more than £10,000 (11,800 euros) per person to smuggle someone into Europe. Mr Mignonet called for more support from the EU in dealing with the problem. Richard Ashworth, the leader of Conservative MEPs, told 5 live: "If the mayor of Calais has evidence of such criminal gangs operating in his jurisdiction he should ensure they are investigated, rooted out and prosecuted will the full force of the law. "Criminality is criminality wherever it happens." He added: "What he should not seek to do is pass his problem on to the UK by seeking financial help just because some immigrants in Calais happen to say their intention was to head for Britain." France is one of 12 countries in Europe that have agreed to offer a limited number of Syrians the right to resettle. The group in Calais have been told by French officials they would be able to claim asylum in France, with a 95% chance of success. Most, though, still seem determined to cross the Channel and are angry at how they have been treated in France. Last week, two men threatened to jump from the roof of the Port of Calais departure lounge unless a representative from the British government went to speak to them and granted them refuge in the UK. They were eventually talked down. They remain in the town and line up daily for food near the port exit. The European Commission says it expects the number of refugees to increase. About 50,000 have so far asked for protection from European countries, the majority in Germany and Sweden. Michele Cercone, the commission's home affairs spokesman, has called for other countries to help. He said: "With a crisis of this magnitude, and the possibility of a prolonged refugee situation, we need to face the situation in the spirit of solidarity. When the pressure is too high on the reception systems of some of our member states, those countries less exposed should be able to step in and support." A Home Office spokesman told 5 live there were no plans to resettle or provide temporary protection to Syrians entering the UK, and added: "Legal and illegal migration in France is the responsibility of the French authorities." The British government has promised to pay £500m to the international relief effort for the victims of the civil war, with that money targeted at providing help to Syria's neighbours. </body>

      <description>Your stories of being alone in the UK</description>

      <body>Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said it is a source of "national shame" that as many as 800,000 people in England are "chronically lonely". Here some people share their stories of feeling isolated and alone in modern society. "I used to run my own business, I had shops - cafes, chip shops and even a toffee shop in the war when I was very young. I was used to seeing lots of people every day and having lots of conversations all the time. I love company and miss that terribly now. The last two years in particular have been very bad. My son works and sees me as often as he can - work permitting - and my daughter-in-law visits me once a week. I have a cleaner that comes in once a week and a dear girl who comes to keep me company. I know I am lucky, that there are people worse off than me. But it's in between those visits that there are a lot of hours to fill in the day. My husband died on Christmas Eve in 1970 - he was only 40 and I was 39. I used to have a lot of friends, many of them were younger than me, but as time goes by, more and more of them seem to succumb to cancer or some other illness and they have died now. But I'm still here. It doesn't seem fair though. My brain is fine but my body is giving up. I just keep going and I worry in the future it will only get worse. I don't fancy going to these social clubs for older people - half of the people in there have lost their minds. I love speaking to younger people though, about anything. It keeps me young. I tell everyone to go and live their life while they are still fit and healthy." "I would consider myself as chronically lonely - my computer and television are my only windows to the outside world. I'm ex-forces and suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). I see my mental health nurse every two weeks and that is basically my only contact with anybody. I don't have any family and I live in a rural area in Norfolk. There isn't much to do here. Everyone here is much younger than me and I see age as an definite communication barrier, and there are also lots of Polish people moving into the community. My PTSD makes me wary of people. When I first left the forces in 1989 I became a Tesco manager and had lots of friends, but my social status dropped when I left the job due to health reasons and people didn't want to speak to me as much. I got this social housing in Norfolk two years ago. I want to move to a larger area about 12 miles away where there is a cinema but I can't do that because I don't meet the criteria and I'm not a high enough priority. It's a Catch 22. I am very unhappy and depressed to the point of clinical depression. I see people walking around hand in hand and I want that. But it only makes it worse, and I feel more resentment towards others. I'd describe myself as a recluse. I'm almost a prisoner in my own home and it's been like that for two years. It's not just a pensioner thing. I'm 51 and considered not elderly at all, therefore not looked at as a person needing care." "I am only 67 and I have a nice home and all the trappings. But I have neighbours who don't speak and I have no family at all. I have a friend who lives a few miles away but he never gets in touch. No-one visits, no-one rings. It's been like this for eight years. Every day is the same and I have to discipline myself to cope with it. I exercise, I do some gardening and my housework and go walking. The only time I see someone is when I shop. I put on my best clothes to go shopping and always look very smart. But once I get home there is no escape from the loneliness. I go to bed at 8.30pm as I'm so fed up with the day - evenings are just terrible. This will be the seventh Christmas on my own and my birthday is Christmas Eve. If I got ill I do not know what would happen. You don't have to be really old to know lonely. People who are surrounded by family have no idea." </body>

      <body>When Sir Stuart Rose says something on retail, it's worth listening. With a 40-year track record in the industry, the former chief executive and chairman of Marks and Spencer is famed for turning around struggling retailers. Now an independent, non-executive director at South Africa's Woolworths Holdings, a chain of shops selling fashion, food, beauty and home ware, he says retail has changed. "Where the customer used to be king before, the customer is now the master of the universe: and they want what they want, how they want it, when they want it." For Woolworths, this shift has been felt most keenly in clothing - an area that along with beauty and home ware makes up 38% of its business in South Africa. In response, over the past two to three years it has made a conscious effort to make its clothing more fashionable, which crucially has involved getting it from the design stage to the shop floor much more quickly. "Previously it was 11-months-plus for all of our clothing products to the point now where we can turn [an item] around in 90 days," says Ian Moir, chief executive of Woolworths (which has no connection with the former British High Street chain of the same name). The strategy appears to be working. The company's most recent results for the year to the end of June saw clothing sales grow by 13.7%. "If we don't give the customer the trend, the colour, the fashion they're looking for, at the end of the day they're going to go somewhere else," says Mr Moir. Neil Saunders, managing director at retail consultancy Conlumino, says the changes at Woolworths reflect a "sea change" in how supermarket groups sell clothing. "They have become more like clothing retailers. Five years ago they used to merchandise it in the same way as, for example, baked beans. They piled it high and sold it cheap. But now they have become lifestyle rather than commodity-led." Mr Saunders says the 2008 financial crisis and resulting recession is a key reason behind this change in approach, with a trend for people to choose quality items that they expect to last. "Before the recession people bought lots of stuff... they even bought stuff they didn't wear. There was a disposable element because clothing was cheap and people felt affluent. "People are more frugal now. They buy less stuff and follow the ethos of, 'If you buy it right you buy it once.'" Mr Saunders says, however, that low prices can still lure in customers if they are combined with fashion, citing Primark as an example. "It's on trend and that makes people very interested. But if a retailer just chases value then they struggle," he adds. UK supermarket group Sainsbury's founded its clothing range Tu almost a decade ago. James Brown, clothing business director at Sainsbury's, says when Tu began it was focused on core products such as leggings, jogging bottoms and T-shirts, with ranges changed every 12 weeks or longer. But in the past two years it has become more trend-led. "Since our recent rebrand the new Tu range is refreshed every six weeks to keep up with the latest fashions, and offer new products to our customer," says Mr Brown. "Over the last nine years we have learnt more about our broad customer base and have adapted the range to offer more High Street-style garments at supermarket prices to meet customer demand," he adds. The approach seems to be working - at its recent trading update for the 16 weeks to 28 September it said its general merchandise and clothing business grew at more than twice the rate of its food business. Mr Brown says new items are planned up to seven months in advance, but that it can react quickly to last-minute trends by turning around a style in just eight weeks, assuming it can get the necessary fabric and has the production capacity. In contrast, for High Street chain Zara, production capacity is rarely an issue because unusually its owner Inditex has its own factories. These manufacture what it says is a "significant share" of its clothing for its eight brands, which include upmarket Massimo Dutti and teen label Bershka, but primarily the most fashionable garments. For those items the clothes can be produced and in store in a rapid two to three weeks. "Customer expectations are higher than ever so our capability to adapt and react to their demands is one of our key strengths," says an Inditex source. For Ian Moir, this is the key to Woolworths' future. "The importance of fashion is becoming greater and greater and customer awareness is getting better and better. "They're very fashion aware and they want it now. That's the way the world is going, it's the way it's changing and it's the way we've got to change as a business."

      <title>'Silver Swans' taking up ballet</title>
      <description>The pensioners who are taking up ballet</description>

      <body>More and more pensioners are taking up ballet, according to the Royal Academy of Dance. It is putting the phenomenon down to the popularity of TV programmes like Strictly Come Dancing. In a locker room at Scottish Ballet, a group of dancers are lacing up their ballet shoes. Only one thing marks them out from the other dancers here. These dancers are all in their 60s and 70s. Today, they are rehearsing Swan Lake. Among them is Alicia Steele. She danced when she was young. Now, nearly 80, she's back. "I went to keep fit classes, but I found them a bit boring," she says. "And I love the music with the piano. I just love it and it makes you feel a bit young again. It doesn't make you look young, but it makes you feel young inside." There's been a 70% jump in the number of adult dancers signing up for classes in recent years, according to the Royal Academy of Dance. Some, like Alicia, danced when they were young. Others are complete beginners. Their oldest ballerina is 102. Preston Clare, teacher of the Scottish Ballet's Regenerate group, says he has been astonished by the change he has seen in his older pupils. "The amazing thing with these ladies is they've grown," he says. "They've stopped slouching now and it's just fantastic to see the difference in them. "They're opening up completely and able to feel more confident in themselves." The lessons at Scottish Ballet have proved so popular, they have added extra classes, and they still have a waiting list. Ballet is good for muscles, balance and memory, but 68-year-old Alison Templeton says it is not just the physical challenge she comes for. "A number of the ladies have lost husbands this year, including myself, and the support of the other ladies is just remarkable," she says. "It does help, and it gives you a focus to go out in the week and do something." Marlene Gillespie, 71, says she absolutely loves the experience. "I can't wait to come," she says. "I love the music. I love the exercise. "We have good days, bad days, we've all been through different things. And I just think it's a wonderful way to exercise, especially for elderly people." Renee Gillespie, 75, adds: "You know you can't really do what you're asked to do but you have great fun trying. And so it's good exercise, it's great fun and it's wonderfully sociable." While some senior citizens are taking on the classics, Dr Anne Hogan, from the Royal Academy of Dance, says for others there is the more gentle option of armchair ballet. "Dance is something that can be modified to all ages and all levels of experience," she says. "In the programme recently, when we trained people to work with older learners, they went into situations in some of the care homes where you had people who had to be seated the entire class, but had a great dance class. "There's lots of movement that can be adapted to people's needs." Following the Genee, the world's biggest dance competition, held in Glasgow last month, the Royal Academy of Dance is holding a week of free ballet lessons across Scotland in January. They hope it will get even more people spend their twilight years at the barre. </body>

      <title>Lawro's predictions, with Susanna Reid</title>
      <description>Can Susanna Reid beat Mark Lawrenson at predicting match results?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24552155</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70522000/jpg/_70522902_4773968-high_res-strictly-come-dancing.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season. This week he takes on BBC Breakfast's Susanna Reid and her Strictly Come Dancing partner Kevin Clifton. Reid is a big Crystal Palace fan who had a season ticket at Selhurst Park in the 1995-96 season, and has been on the pitch herself in the last couple of weeks. "I have some brilliant memories of watching Palace in some fantastic venues," Reid said. "I still make the occasional visit, but being on Strictly means Saturday games have been rather interrupted. "Even so, I had the chance to go and practise some moves at Selhurst Park earlier this month. "We were doing the Viennese Waltz and what we needed was a lot of space to glide, so Kev thought that would be the perfect place to expand - and be inspired by an amazing football team." Clifton has supported Scunthorpe United all his life but he also follows Chelsea because his dad is a fan of the Blues and said: "He really wanted to call me Osgood Clifton after Peter Osgood, but my mum was not having any of it!" You can see all of their predictions on Football Focus at 12:00 BST on Saturday on BBC One and the BBC Sport website in the UK, Reid and Clifton willl be back on the dance floor in Strictly Come Dancing at 18:30 BST on Saturday. A correct result is worth ONE point. A correct score earns THREE points. Last week, Lawro got nine results right, with two perfect scores. His score of 13 saw him trounce comedian, actor, writer and TV presenter Michael Palin, who got one correct result with no perfect scores, and goes to the bottom of the guest leaderboard. We're keeping a record of the total scores for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct (also at the bottom of the page). All kick-offs at 15:00 BST unless otherwise stated. Liverpool won 6-0 at St James' Park in April but things will be a lot closer this time. This Newcastle team still has a lot to prove as far as I am concerned. Loic Remy has done extremely well since arriving on loan from QPR but he was their only significant summer signing. The Magpies signed a lot of players in January but most of them have been very inconsistent. For me, they badly needed more new faces in the summer to improve the balance in the dressing room and gee some of the others up. I am going to back Alan Pardew's men to get a draw on Saturday, though. The Reds will be looking to pick up where they left off before the international break but they are away from home and a point will be a decent result. Lawro's prediction: 1-1 Reid's prediction: 1-3 Clifton's prediction: 1-2 All is well with Arsenal at the moment, and they have had more good news because it looks like Mesut Ozil will be able to play on Saturday despite picking up a knock playing for Germany in midweek. To be honest, I never worry about players when they have 'knocks' - they are different to muscle injuries because you cannot make a 'knock' any worse and, if you can stand the pain, then you are fine. I feel a bit sorry for Norwich because they did well for long spells against Chelsea last time out. They gave them a really good game, especially in the second half, but ended up being beaten 3-1. Canaries manager Chris Hughton is coming under pressure but I hope the board look at this game and realise that Arsenal are top of the league for a reason, which is because they are playing better football than anybody, have loads of creative players and are scoring goals from all areas. Norwich, in contrast, have not found it so easy to find the net - they have only scored five times in their first seven league games, compared with 14 from the Gunners. Away from home, and especially at the Emirates, are they going to be able to pose a serious goal threat? I don't think so. Hughton likes to play one up front away from home, and he is not going to change that this weekend. When I look at this game, I cannot see anything other than a comfortable home win. I only hope that Hughton does not find himself under any more pressure after this game. Norwich's next three home games are against Cardiff, West Ham and Crystal Palace and people should look at how many points they have got after that. Lawro's prediction: 2-0 Reid's prediction: 2-0 Clifton's prediction: 3-0 I cannot believe what is happening at Cardiff with the removal of their head of recruitment Iain Moody, who was a key member of manager Malky Mackay's backroom staff. I'm sorry, but what is Bluebirds' owner Vincent Tan trying to do? He should just let Mackay manage the team because they are doing fine. For Mackay's future to be insecure is absolutely ridiculous. They are becoming a laughing stock and it has nothing to do with their results; it is to do with one person. Maybe Tan should just take the manager's job himself. Tan is in danger of sending Cardiff into freefall and there is only one way that is going to end up - relegation. Chelsea have had mixed start to the season but are only a couple of points off the top of the table. We know the problems they have had with the balance of their team and boss Jose Mourinho has fired off a broadside about it, but they are still in there and looking good. This should be a comfortable afternoon for them. Lawro's prediction: 3-0 Reid's prediction: 2-1 Clifton's prediction: I think Chelsea are going to be too strong for Cardiff at Stamford Bridge and they will win 2-0. A lot of people were talking about Chelsea struggling at the start of the season but they are only a couple of points off the top of the league and have a lot of great players to choose from. They are definitely title contenders. Hull have been the Premier League's surprise package this season - not just with their results but with the way they play, which has been very easy on the eye. It will be tough for them on Saturday, though. Everton lost their unbeaten record against Manchester City last time out and they really need to bounce back. The likes of Phil Jagielka and Leighton Baines will be on a high after their exploits for England and this looks like a 2-0 Everton win to me. Lawro's prediction: 2-0 Reid's prediction: 2-1 Clifton's prediction: 2-0 Manchester United are very difficult to predict at the moment. They won at Sunderland despite not being very good, while their last home game saw West Brom go to Old Trafford and play them off the park. Yet, after watching the United players who played for England against Montenegro and Poland - and they all did extremely well - I would have to back them to beat Southampton, and comfortably. This is a good Saints team and they will go and attack, because that is their strength. But that win at the Stadium of Light, albeit slightly fortuitous because it came late, might just kick-start United under David Moyes. Lawro's prediction: 2-0 Reid's prediction: 2-1 Clifton's prediction: 3-2 Stoke made a decent start to the season but, after being unlucky not to beat Manchester City last month, they have lost three in a row now and their manager Mark Hughes badly needs a win. The Potters' biggest single problem is that they do not carry a goal threat. They have got some good players but I do not know where their goals are going to come from. Yes, they are changing the way they play, but they need results too. West Brom made a slower start to the season, but they have shown in their last two games against Manchester United and Arsenal what a good side they are. Steve Clarke's side are very strong going forward but that might actually help Stoke a little bit because the Baggies will be a bit more open. Lawro's prediction: 2-1 Reid's prediction: "We have to declare an interest here because we are dancing with Abbey Clancy, and her husband Peter Crouch plays for Stoke. If he plays on Saturday, I reckon he is going score and I think he is going to score late in a 1-1 draw." Clifton's prediction: "I really hope Peter plays and gets a win. It's a difficult one, though, because West Brom are playing and looking good - and I am going to have to go for a 1-0 Baggies win." All eyes will be on new Sunderland boss Gus Poyet in his first game in charge but Swansea need a result too - they have not won at home in the Premier League yet. I think Poyet will be looking for a performance from his players more than anything else. He will be looking at their attitude, concentration and commitment. That sort of thing is the bottom line because, if he gets that, then he has something to build on. If he can get a point or three points on Saturday too, then fantastic. The big game for Poyet is the following weekend, at home to Newcastle. In those games, anything can and will happen but what Poyet does not want to do is lose that one because, for Sunderland fans, those games are the biggest of their season. Sunderland have only got one point from their first seven games but Poyet has got time to turn things round. The biggest thing he has got to do is build a rapport in the dressing room because that was shot away under the Di Canio regime. He will have been doing that in training and also just in the way he talks to his players. What might help him out with every aspect of man-management is that he is following Di Canio - if one of the Teletubbies was following him, they would look all right. Lawro's prediction: 2-1 Reid's prediction: 3-0 Clifton's prediction: 2-0 Manchester City's away league form under Manuel Pellegrini has been poor so far, with only one point from three games, and I don't think he has quite come to terms with the demands of the Premier League. But if there is a place you can keep things tight it is at West Ham, because the pitch at Upton Park is not the biggest. That is one of the reasons I am leaning towards a draw here. West Ham's win over Tottenham last time out was a superb result. But what Hammers boss Sam Allardyce tends to do after a win like that is to try to not lose for the next few games. And it might sound daft for a team that won 3-0 at White Hart Lane, but West Ham are short of firepower. They are so short of strikers, they have re-signed Carlton Cole after releasing him in the summer. I can only guess that Frank McAvennie and Tony Cottee were not available. Lawro's prediction: 1-1 Reid's prediction: 0-1 Clifton's prediction: 0-1 I know Tottenham went to Villa Park and won 4-0 in the Capital One Cup in September, but this will be a completely different game. Christian Benteke will be back up front for Aston Villa after making a faster-than-expected recovery from his injury, and that will clearly be a big boost for them. Villa will have a point to prove after that defeat while we must wait and see whether Spurs have been unhinged a bit by their shock home defeat by West Ham. That was not only their worst result of the season so far but, within a few hours, Andre Villas-Boas saw all his players disappear to play international football. He will not have had much of a chance to work with them on what went wrong. Lawro's prediction: 1-1 Reid's prediction: 0-2 Clifton's prediction: 1-3 Fulham fans are still chasing Martin Jol despite his side's late win over Stoke in their last game. That was a big result for Jol and I still think he is a good manager. Hopefully his job is safe too. I read an interview with Cottagers owner Shahid Khan recently and I liked what he said. He owns the Jackonsville Jaguars NFL franchise in the US too, so he knows how unpredictable sport can be. I think he knows Jol is a good manager too. Khan did not appoint Jol, which is always a problem, but I am hopeful he will just leave him in there. Palace have lost four games in a row now, and I think Fulham will make it five. Eagles boss Ian Holloway is a good manager but his problem is that all of his players need to play well in order to get any sort of positive result. It seems like every week at the moment one section of their team is letting them down. That could happen to them in the Championship and they could get away with it - they might not concede. In the Premier League, you get punished. Lawro's prediction: 1-2 Reid's prediction: "Palace are on a run of four defeats but at home I think this is the moment we bounce back. I think it is going to be a tightly fought game and it is going to be 3-2 to Palace." Clifton's prediction: 1-0. Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan Make your own predictions to see how the Premier League will look after this weekend. </body>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <body>Friday's papers take aim at British Gas over the energy company's 9% hike in prices. The Daily Mirror sets the tone with a picture of boss Chris Weston alongside the headline: "I'm putting your gas bill up by 10% - now where's my two million pound bonus?" Sun readers should leave what the paper calls "Brutish Gas" and switch to other firms. It's launched a campaign against what it calls "hated" green taxes which it blames for adding to energy bills. "Heat or eat", the Daily Express warns as it predicts soaring bills will lead to a "devastating increase" in winder deaths. The Daily Mail reports on a warning from the Royal Academy of Engineering that the lights could go out as early as next year. And the Guardian highlights a public relations disaster for British Gas after it tried to quell criticism on social media. It says almost 16,000 mostly vitriolic tweets "rained down" on the company in just a few hours. The Times assesses George Osborne's announcement that the Chinese can take a stake in the UK's nuclear power plans. It could pose important security issues, the paper says. In his first interview since being sacked last week, Lib Dem former minister Jeremy Browne tells the Times he is puzzled as to why he lost his job. But it is the plight of a Lib Dem still with a ministerial job who was forced to stand at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday which reaches a number of Friday's papers. The Daily Mail says the Commons is obviously no "hotbed of chivalry" as none of the dozens of MPs sitting nearby saw fit to offer pregnant Jo Swinson a seat. A Daily Mirror editorial argues giving up a seat for a pregnant lady isn't sexism but simple good manners. Millions of people could be spared the agony of crippling back pain by seeking early treatment, according to the front page of the Daily Express. Several papers report criticism of a school in Leeds which apparently allowed pupils as young as eleven to smoke in the playground. The Daily Telegraph says that cigarettes have been confiscated as the children arrive each day, but handed back at break times. There's support for the England manager, Roy Hodgson, after his "feed the monkey" comment during a team talk. The Telegraph calls him "one of the most civilised people in football", while the Independent asks: "Why all the fuss?" Meanwhile children's groups and internet safety experts have rounded on Facebook, according to the Times, after it announced plans which will allow millions of teenage users to open up their profiles to strangers. And finally, a number of papers report findings from scientists who say that from the age of 18 months, children can tell when we are faking our emotions. "Smile and the world smiles with you, cry and you cry alone," says the Times. "However, smile when you feel like crying, and your toddler is going to be pretty puzzled." </body>

      <title>SNP pledges energy bill cut post Yes</title>
      <description>Scotland's deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon unveils plans to cut energy bills by 5% a year in an independent Scotland.</description>

      <body>Scotland's deputy first minister has unveiled plans to cut energy bills by about 5% a year if the country votes for independence. Nicola Sturgeon told the SNP's conference in Perth the reduction of about £70 would be achieved by removing a number of "green" charges. She believed the measure would not be a short-term fix, but a "real and lasting cut". People in Scotland vote in an independence referendum next year. On Thursday, 18 September, 2014, they will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?" Ms Sturgeon explained that two schemes worth up to half of the green costs imposed on energy companies would be removed from the bills of consumers. The minister told the party's annual gathering: "Right now, the Scottish government invests around £80m a year on energy efficiency schemes to help meet our climate change targets and lower the costs of energy bills. "A further £120m comes from a scheme designed in Westminster, operated through energy companies and paid for by a levy on your gas and electricity bills. "It is a disjointed approach, it doesn't take account of Scottish priorities and it's not as efficient as it could be." Ms Sturgeon went on to announce that an SNP government in an independent Scotland would remove the energy saving measures and the warm home discount from energy bills. She said the current system would be replaced by a more joined-up approach with funding for fuel poverty schemes - worth up to £200m per year - coming directly from government. Ms Sturgeon added: "Independence will allow us to tackle fuel poverty much more directly, delivering Scottish solutions to Scottish problems, and ensuring that energy companies always behave in a socially responsible way to protect vulnerable customers." She insisted the energy schemes would be delivered more effectively and it would save hard-pressed consumers money. The SNP deputy leader told the conference: "We estimate that it will cut energy bills by around 5% - or £70 a year. "Not a short-term measure - but a real and lasting cut in Scottish energy bills." The minister went on to demand that the coalition government at Westminster ditch its spare room subsidy, which is described by critics as the ''bedroom tax''. But she said if it refused to act, the current Scottish government would allocate "up to £20m" for a second year to help those who have been affected. Ms Sturgeon also announced that the Holyrood administration would fund the Poverty Alliance to deliver a Living Wage Accreditation Scheme to "promote the living wage and increase the number of private companies that pay it". Turning to the issue of health, Ms Sturgeon said a UK-wide approach "would be the worst thing that could ever happen to the Scottish NHS". She added: "Westminster privatisation of the NHS is not wanted in Scotland. "Scotland's national health service is staying in public hands." Ms Sturgeon went on to warn that Westminster MPs in all the UK parties were "itching to abolish the Barnett formula and cut Scotland's share of spending". She said: "So, I say this to everyone yet to make up their mind [on independence]. Consider carefully the arguments for a Yes vote. Subject them to scrutiny and ask the tough questions. "But do not ever let anyone pull the wool over your eyes about the consequences of a No vote. "They are clear and they are real. Scotland's social security system will be dismantled; Scotland's public services and universal benefits will be under threat and Scotland's budget will be cut. "The risks of a No vote are real." Ms Sturgeon promised that the Scottish government's White Paper on independence, which is due to be published next month, would "answer all your questions". She added: "The White Paper will be Scotland's detailed guide to independence. "It will make the positive case. It will explain the process by which we will become independent and describe how our newly independent country will work. "It will set out the gains of independence for you, your family and for your community." Towards the end of her speech, Ms Sturgeon said: "The vote in 2014 is not a vote for or against the SNP. "It is a vote for or against the power to take decisions in Scotland." She insisted that an SNP government after independence would bring the mail service back into public ownership; reverse welfare reforms; protect state pensions and get rid of Trident nuclear weapons. </body>

      <title>No deal over Grangemouth restart</title>
      <description>Management and unions at the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical plant fail to reach a deal to allow operations at the site to restart.</description>

      <body>Management and unions at the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical plant have failed to reach a deal which would see the site fired up again. Operators Ineos asked the Unite union to make a commitment to call no further industrial action this year. Unite said it would agree to this, but on the condition that Ineos would not impose its planned cuts on the workforce during the same period. The two sides held a face-to-face meeting at the plant earlier. Ineos said it would have restarted operations at the site on Friday if Unite had given the company a "no conditions, no strings attached" assurance of no further industrial action this year. However, it claimed the union had refused that offer. Calum MacLean, Ineos Grangemouth (UK) chairman, said: "Unite's response is unbelievable given how much effort has been put into securing this deal with ourselves, the Scottish and the UK governments all working hard to find a way forward. "We will now concentrate on discussing the Survival Plan with our staff during the 60-day consultation". Unite said it had already promised no strike action before Christmas but the union repeated its calls for Ineos to abandon proposed changes to staff contracts. Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scottish secretary, said: "At Acas talks earlier this week, Unite committed to conducting no industrial action ballots or industrial action before 31 December 2013. "This was on the basis that the company would not impose cuts on the workforce during the same period. Unite also proposed that these negotiations over the future of the site during this period would be held under the auspices of Acas." He added: "If the company lifts the cuts agenda that it is imposing on its workers, then our offer still stands." Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond earlier warned of a risk to the future of Grangemouth if the current stand-off continues. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, he said the longer site remained "idle and cold" the more difficult things would become. Mr Salmond met with Ineos and Unite representatives on Thursday. Ineos said shutting down the Grangemouth complex had cost the company £20m so far. The firm had put proposals over pay and pensions to workers at the complex, which has 1,400 employees and many more contractors. A letter outlining the proposed changes - which includes freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016 - was being couriered to employees on Friday. Unite claimed the company had told staff they could lose their jobs and be reemployed on poorer terms unless they agreed to give up their final salary pension, and accept pay freezes and pay cuts, by 18:00 on Monday. The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans. </body>

      <title>Pilots did not spot reduced airspeed</title>
      <description>Air accident investigators say a reduction in air speed that caused the fatal crash of a helicopter off Shetland was not noticed by the pilots.</description>

      <body>Air accident investigators have said a reduction in airspeed that caused the fatal crash of a helicopter off Shetland was not noticed by the pilots. Four people died when the Super Puma crashed on approach to Sumburgh Airport on 23 August. The ongoing Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) investigation has so far found no evidence of a technical fault. The investigation will now focus on the effectiveness of pilot monitoring of instruments and the training of crews. An interim report published by the AAIB said that, as the helicopter approached to within 2.3 nautical miles of the airport, the commander noted that its airspeed had reduced to 80 knots. The commander increased the collective pitch, intending to maintain the speed. But the helicopter's airspeed reduced to below 80 knots, unobserved by the crew. A short time later, there was an automated audio call of "check height", which was acknowledged by the commander, and then a comment by the co-pilot to draw the commander's attention to the airspeed. At this time, the helicopter's airspeed was only 35 knots and reducing. There was then a second automated call of "check height" followed by a "100 feet" automated call. The report stated: "At some point the commander saw the sea, but he was unable to arrest the helicopter's descent and it struck the water shortly thereafter. "The co-pilot, realising that the helicopter was about to enter the water, armed the helicopter's flotation system. "After striking the surface the helicopter rapidly inverted, but remained afloat, the flotation equipment having successfully deployed". There were 18 people on board the helicopter at the time. Sarah Darnley, 45, from Elgin, Gary McCrossan, 59, from Inverness, Duncan Munro, 46, from Bishop Auckland, and George Allison, 57, from Winchester, lost their lives in the incident. The AAIB investigators also called for a review of rescue operations in the water surrounding Sumburgh Airport. A number of lifeboats and helicopters were sent to the scene, but the report said one rescue boat supposed to leave from a slipway to the west of the airport was delayed due to tidal conditions and instead had to leave from the south of the airport. It took almost an hour to reach the crash scene. The report said: "It is recommended that the Civil Aviation Authority reviews the risks associated with the current water rescue provision for the area of sea to the west of Sumburgh Airport and take appropriate action." </body>

      <title>Man jailed for causing crash death</title>
      <description>A 24-year-old provisional driver is jailed for more than seven years for causing the death of a woman in an Aberdeen crash.</description>

      <body>A man has been jailed for more than seven years for causing the death of a woman in an Aberdeen crash. Andrew Carney, 25, from Stonehaven, admitted causing the death of 48-year-old Jaqueline Lyon at the city's Beach Esplanade on 27 August last year. At the High Court in Glasgow the provisional driver was sentenced to seven years and two months in prison and banned from driving for 10 years. Insp Ian Kirkwood said Carney's actions were "utterly reckless". The court heard how Carney was driving at more than twice the speed limit before he lost control of his car on a bend and hit Mrs Lyon's BMW on the wrong side of the road. He also admitted driving without a licence or insurance. Carney got into the car with his friend after a row with his girlfriend before speeding in the atrocious weather that day, the court heard. He overtook a number of concerned witnesses on the 30mph road. One witness had said "this is an accident waiting to happen". He crossed on to the wrong lane at a bend and hit Mrs Lyon head on. She died at the scene. Witness Lesley Nicolson told the court Carney had overtaken her at excessive speed. She said he drove so close she thought he might take her wing mirror off. She had pulled over to phone the police and report the manner in which the Golf was being driven. Witnesses described being "alarmed" at the speed at which Carney was driving, and most of them heard the car before they saw it. Officers concluded that Carney was driving "well in excess" of the speed limit and overtook a number of cars in very wet conditions. Calculations indicate that before reaching the bend, Carney had at one point been driving at about 53mph and at another point about 69mph. Police said that given the speed, Mrs Lyon would have had little or no time to react. Richard Freeman, defending, said Carney showed "genuine shock and remorse". Judge Lord Turnbull told the 25-year-old: "Should any road user choose to drive in a reckless or dangerous manner they must take responsibility for the consequences of that decision." He said that an innocent woman "in the prime of her life" was killed and that it was also a tragedy for her family left behind. He added that an aggravating factor was the "atrocious weather". Speaking after the sentence Mrs Lyon's husband Mark, 50, said: "I will be serving a longer sentence". He described his wife as "quiet, very loving and very caring" and said his life and their daughter's life had changed "dramatically". Insp Kirkwood, of Police Scotland, said: "The actions of Andrew Carney on 27 August 2012 were despicable and tragically led to the loss of an innocent life; inflicting indescribable grief on a loving, close-knit family. "Andrew Carney was driving dangerously and at an inappropriate and excessive speed - one of the worst cases of its kind the city has seen." He added: "We are pleased that our work to seek justice has not been in vain and that this man will now pay for the overwhelming heartache he has caused the family and friends of Jacqueline Lyon. "The result today will not heal the terrible suffering her family have had to endure since that fateful day, but it can hopefully bring them some closure and help them slowly re-build their lives." </body>

      <body>Disruption caused by 18 months of tram works in the west end of Edinburgh is to end on Saturday when affected streets are reopened to traffic. The reopening of the Manor Place to Shandwick Place stretch of the road will signal the end of tram works in the city centre, after six years. There will be a return to two-way vehicle traffic at Manor Place. Shandwick Place will have bus, taxi and cycle access, with general vehicles allowed entry between 20:00 and 07:00. Lesley Hinds, City of Edinburgh Council's transport convener, said: "With the tram project now nearing completion, the city centre is beginning to take shape and we can look forward to next year when passenger services will begin. "We know it's been very difficult for people living and working in areas affected by the tram works and it will be a big relief that the majority of disruptive works in the city centre are now over. "Now is the time to look forward to the opportunities ahead and to embrace the benefits that a modern, integrated transport system, incorporating all transport options, can bring to our city. "Our target for service launch is now May 2014 but, of course, we'll bring this forward if we can." Transport Minister Keith Brown said: "Alongside the redevelopment of Haymarket and Waverley Stations, Edinburgh will very soon have a modern transport system it can be proud of. "The investment at Haymarket, Waverley, the Gateway and in electrification, takes us one step closer to revolutionising the rail network in central Scotland." "We cannot forget the disruption that those living and working in the west end have had to endure for too many years, but we can welcome this step forward in a tram project which is gathering pace." Testing has begun between Gogar depot and Edinburgh Park Station with full route testing scheduled to begin in December. The council has set out plans to create a new organisation, Transport for Edinburgh, to integrate transport services in the capital. Transport for Edinburgh will be set up initially to integrate the tram and bus services, with Lothian Buses and Edinburgh Trams confirmed as the operators. City of Edinburgh Council said it was confident it could meet the revised budget of £776m and the latest target of having the tram line operating before summer 2014. </body>

      <title>Plan for new £200m conference centre</title>
      <description>A new £200m venue could be on the cards for Aberdeen to replace the city's Exhibition and Conference Centre.</description>

      <body>A new £200m concert and conference venue could be on the cards for Aberdeen, council leaders have said. They want to invest in a replacement for the current Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre (AECC). Under the plans the AECC - which is sited at the Bridge of Don - would continue to operate until the new venue was built, which could be by 2017. BBC Scotland understands that the new venue could be built in Dyce, close to Aberdeen International Airport. Tory councillor Ross Thomson, a member of the city's ruling administration, said the council wanted to speak to the Scottish government to ask if they would provide financial support for the project. He said: "The Scottish government at the moment funds the SECC in Glasgow, and also the concert venue in Edinburgh. "Aberdeen is so strategic and so important, not just to the Scottish economy but also to the rest of the UK, particularly with big exhibitions such as Offshore Europe. "We think there would be an opportunity for the Scottish government to re-evaluate the way it funds some of the other venues in Scotland and maybe look at diverting some of their funds to Aberdeen. "There is also international interest in the exhibition centre and we might be able to work with other partners to deliver the project". Mr Thomson said the current AECC site was restricted in terms of the space available for expansion. He added: "We would be looking at doing something entirely new, I think. We would have to keep the Bridge of Don site available for 2015, which is when the next Offshore Europe is coming, but we would hope to have a new a new facility ready for Offshore Europe in 2017." The current conference centre brings in tens of millions of pounds annually for the local economy, and is seen as vital to Aberdeen's status as an energy capital and host of the Offshore Europe events. But the council has has had to bail out the venue several times in recent years. Last year, the local authority said it would write off loans of £26.2m in order to give the AECC a "firmer financial footing". </body>

She admitted culpably and recklessly starting the fire, severely injuring herself and endangering the lives of others and property on 28 June 2011. In August 2012 the judge had deferred sentence to allow Sapkota to show she could stay out of trouble. At the High Court in Edinburgh, defence advocate Sarah Livingstone said Sapkota, 31, had already paid a price. She said: "She has been punished by the terrible injuries she suffered. She is still receiving treatment for them." As he admonished her, the judge said it had been the right way to deal with the case. The court heard that Sapkota had failed her driving test for the fourth time despite taking more than 90 lessons. Her failed efforts to get on the road had placed a burden on the family's finances and led to rows with her husband. Sapkota doused her clothes in white spirit and set herself alight after leaving a suicide note written in her native Nepalese, saying she no longer wanted to live. A neighbour was alerted and a 999 call brought firefighters to her flat in Gordon Street in the Leith area of Edinburgh. They used breathing apparatus and managed to rescue the semi-conscious woman. She had suffered burns to her face, back and arms. Defence counsel Sarah Livingstone said Sapkota was trying to harm herself and no-one else. </body>

      <description>The stadium manager of a Scottish Premiership football club admits sexually assaulting a woman in the ground's stands.</description>

      <body>The stadium manager of a Scottish Premiership football club has admitted sexually assaulting a woman in the ground's stands. Albert Dawson carried out the attack in the East Stand of Dundee United's Tannadice stadium in 2011. He walked up behind his victim, who was also employed by the club, put his arms around her, touched her breasts and put his hands between her legs. Dawson admitted the offence at Dundee Sheriff Court. Sentence was deferred. The court was told that 49-year-old Dawson, who also acts as the club's head groundsman, approached the woman near a catering kiosk and asked "What are you doing?". Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson said: "He then touched her breasts over her clothing, put his hands between her legs and cupping her genitals over her clothing for a few seconds. "He thereafter walked away as she became extremely shocked and upset. "She ran out of the stand and found a groundsman who was nearby and told him what was happening. The groundsman could see she was upset. "She subsequently went home, still upset and crying, and told her partner about the incident." The woman then raised a complaint with her line manager at the club - but said she didn't want the police involved at that point. Dawson was then confronted by club bosses and admitted his behaviour, telling them: "I grabbed her from behind." But he was only given a warning and was allowed to keep his job. Miss Robertson added: "The accused did not speak to the complainer for some time, however at the start of last football season he made a further comment towards her that made her feel uncomfortable and it was at this point she decided to report the incident to police. "She was hysterically upset while disclosing the matter to them. The following week she left her job and went on sick leave. "The accused was interviewed in relation to this matter by police and said 'I held my hands up to that - I had been mucking about with the lass and I went too far'. "He admitted he had cupped her genitals and couldn't provide any defence for his actions. He confirmed they had never been in a relationship." Dawson, 49, of Forfar, pleaded guilty to a charge of sexually assaulting the woman at Tannadice Park on one occasion between 1 February 2011 and 30 April 2011. Bob Bruce, defending, said he would speak in mitigation for Dawson at a later sentencing date. Sheriff Tom Hughes deferred sentence for social work reports until next month. He said: "You will be subject to the sex offenders register from today." </body>

      <body>A 75-year-old man has died almost two months after being injured when a runaway car rolled down a hill and pinned him to the front of a house. The man was walking in the Townhead area of Beith, in North Ayrshire, on 25 August when he was dragged into a garden by the car. It is understood the vehicle had been parked at the top of a slope without its handbrake on. Police Scotland confirmed the injured man had died on Thursday. Rescue crews from Beith and Kilbirnie had used high pressure airbags to lift the vehicle and remove the injured man. The 30-minute operation involved removing concrete steps at the front door of the home to allow them access. The man had been taken to Glasgow's Southern General Hospital with severe head and chest injuries. </body>

      <body>Police have released a photograph of a missing yachtsman's boat to help efforts by the emergency services and rescue teams to find him. Antonin Mican, 32, was last at Gardenstown Harbour in the north east of Scotland on Friday evening. It is believed he may have been intending to sail to Wick on the Caithness coast. Mr Mican's yacht was described as a 22ft-long blue and white Jaguar 22 with one outboard engine. A search involving lifeboats and an RAF helicopter in the Moray Firth on Thursday afternoon found no trace. Divers and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency have joined the search, which resumed earlier. Det Insp Norman Stevenson, of Police Scotland, has appealed for people to report possible sightings of Mr Mican. He said: "It appears that this boat is Mican's only form of transport and he could have stopped anywhere along the coastline. "We have carried out searches of the local area, although this will be continually reviewed as we go forward and assess any new information we receive." </body>

      <title>Delay to shotgun seizure criticised</title>
      <description>The police watchdog criticises a decision by officers not to immediately seize a farmer's gun after he pointed it as a suspected poacher's chest.</description>

      <body>The police watchdog has criticised a decision by officers not to immediately seize a farmer's gun after he pointed it as a suspected poacher's chest. The farmer had contacted police to report that poachers were on his land. He later met three men who he believed to be the poachers, and was alleged to have pointed his shotgun at one of them. But a sergeant assessed the risk as "low" and the farmer was not detained until the following evening. The farmer at the centre of the case had contacted officers from Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary on the evening of 22 January 2010 to report that poachers had been seen "lamping" on his land. Lamping is a technique used by poachers using a high powered lamp to identify and pursue rabbits, game or vermin. Officers attended and had contact with the farmer and his wife who were searching for the poachers. After leaving the police officers, the farmer returned to his car and retrieved his shotgun, which he loaded with two cartridges. A short time later, he met three men, known only as Mr F, Mr G and Mr H, who he suspected of having been poaching. During this exchange the farmer was alleged to have pointed his shotgun at the chest of Mr F. Later than night, Mr F made a statement to police in which he reported that the farmer had pointed the shotgun at him about 6-12 inches from his chest. A sergeant assessed the risk to the general public as "low" and instructed a constable to continue her enquiries when she returned to duty the next day. The farmer was detained at 20:45 on 23 January, when his shotguns were also seized. As part of a review of the case - which was prompted by a complaint from the farmer - Prof John McNeill, the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner, examined the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) in force at that time within Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary. It effectively required officers to exercise professional judgement when deciding whether weapons should be seized immediately in such circumstances. In his report, the commissioner said the circumstances of the case ought to have raised a concern that the farmer might present a danger, if not to the wider public, then certainly to Mr F who lived in the general vicinity of the farmer's home. The commissioner also found that the SOP allowed officers too wide a discretion in relation to the seizure of weapons. Prof McNeill said: "While in this case the decision regarding the seizure of the shotgun was based on the SOP in place at that time, in my view there should be no discretion available to officers as to whether the weapons should be seized. "I am pleased that the Police Scotland SOP addresses the deficiency which existed in the Dumfries and Galloway SOP at that time. "It is also encouraging that another of the complaints made by the farmer in relation to the retrieval of the shotguns has been used to inform a wider debate about the involvement of untrained officers in situations of this kind and that the force has significantly revised its approach to reports involving the criminal use of firearms, whereby risk assessments would now completed by trained firearms commanders." </body>

      <body>A man who bit off part of his cousin's ear has been jailed for three years and four months. Andrew Montgomery, 34, from Dundee, carried out the assault before chasing Dean Montgomery, who was clutching his severed lobe, down the street. The court had previously heard how assault came after a family dispute over a grave plot. Passing sentence, Sheriff Kenneth McGowan described the assault as "vicious". He said: "I accept you didn't set out to bite your cousin's ear off but you must have known that violence could result when you met him. "The assault was vicious and compounded by the fact that you went after him and continued an assault on him while he was on the ground. "In all the circumstances a custodial sentence is unavoidable." Dean Montgomery was left needing extensive reconstructive surgery to create a new ear as the detached part could not be saved. Andrew Montgomery had pled guilty on Thursday to a charge of assaulting his cousin to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement. The incident happened in Dens Road in Dundee on 30 July last year. Sentence had been deferred for a day to allow a full plea in mitigation to be heard from Andrew Montgomery's lawyer. When the case called again on Friday morning, Jack Brown, defending, said there had been a long-standing family dispute. He said: "This was an unhappy coming together of two family members. It may have seemed a trivial matter over a grave plot, but it took on significant ramifications within the family. "He is assessed as a medium to high risk of reoffending, but I would submit he is not a risk to the public in general. "This was a particular incident in a particular set of circumstances." Andrew Montgomery's family members wept in the public benches as he was led away. Dean Montgomery shouted "thank you judge" as he left the courtroom. </body>

      <body>The £1.4bn Queensferry Crossing will be toll-free when it opens in 2016, Scotland's Finance Secretary has said. John Swinney told the SNP conference that as long as there was a nationalist government at Holyrood there would be no charge. Tolls on all road bridges in Scotland ended in February 2008. The new crossing over the Forth is being built to replace the existing structure, linking Edinburgh and Fife, which is deteriorating. Mr Swinney told his party's Perth gathering that the Scottish government's decision to lift polls from the Forth and Tay Bridges five years ago resulted in commuters saving up to £233 per annum. He added: "The Queensferry crossing - the biggest infrastructure project in a generation - is helping the people of Fife with jobs, apprenticeships and contracts for local companies. It is being delivered on time - and it is being delivered under budget. "And when it opens in 2016, and for as long as we are in government, I guarantee, there will be no tolls on the Queensferry crossing." After years of lobbying by anti-tolls campaigners, the Labour/Lib Dem coalition removed charges on the Skye Bridge in December 2004 and on the Erskine Bridge in May 2006. </body>

      <body>A filling station in a community proposed for a discount on fuel prices closed five years ago. Achnasheen in Wester Ross is among 10 rural communities in mainland Scotland and England earmarked for a possible 5p a litre reduction in fuel duty. BBC Scotland news website readers have flagged up Achnasheen's lack of working petrol and diesel pumps. But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander has said the locations listed were postcode areas. Two of the nearest filling stations to Achnasheen are at Kinlochewe and Laide. Mr Alexander told BBC Scotland that filling stations in the area around Achnasheen had sought the discount. He said: "What is being referred to is the wider postcode area. "There are filling stations within the postcode area otherwise it wouldn't be on the list." The Highland MP also said that it was possible that other remote areas could be added to the list later, if they met the scheme's criteria. Highland Council's transport spokesman, SNP councillor Graham Phillips, has said parts of Sutherland should have been included. At the moment the scheme applies to Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly. The UK has applied to the European Commission (EC) for the reduction to be extended to 10 mainland locations. They are Acharacle, Achnasheen, Appin, Carrbridge, Dalwhinnie, Gairloch and Strathpeffer. Kirkby-in-Furness in Cumbria, Hawes in North Yorkshire and Lynton in Devon are also included. </body>

      <body>Forgotten Gaelic place names in Lochaber that recall tales of murder and an epic boar hunt have been recorded in a new guide. Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) said many of the names no longer appear on modern maps. Some of stories behind them are also appearing in print for the first time, the public body added. The booklet, Gaelic in the Landscape: The Rough Bounds of Lochaber, was launched at the Royal National Mod. The celebration of Gaelic language and culture is taking place in Paisley. SNH and Ainmean-Aite na h-Alba co-ordinated the project to create the guide. Among the place names is Sgurr Tuirce, near Loch Shiel, which means boar peak. In the new guide, the name is linked to an Ossianic story about an ancient hunt across Scotland for a huge tusked boar. Near Loch Morar, Na Cailleachan Buidhe - meaning the yellow women - is said to recall the story of two women who were murdered in the 1500s before their bodies were buried in peat. </body>

      <body>A couple who were caught with more than £100,000 worth of Class A drugs in their Midlothian home have been jailed. Lee Middlemass, 25, was jailed for three years and nine months and Jo-Anna Wallace, 21, for two years at the High Court in Edinburgh. The pair had previously pled guilty to offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act. A search of their home in Dalkeith in October 2012 found 1.3 kilos of cocaine, £7,195 in cash, a hydraulic press and other drug-making equipment. Wallace, 21, had asked the judge not to be separated from her baby daughter when, at an earlier hearing, she admitted being concerned in the supply of the drug. Unusually, judge Lord Pentland allowed her and partner Middlemass to remain on bail pending sentence, so they could spend more time with their three-month-old However, when the pair appeared for sentence the judge dismissed a plea to allow Wallace to do community service, saying the court would be failing in its duty. He said: "What sort of message would that send to society and, in particular, to persons further up the drug chain who might be tempted to prey on vulnerable individuals?" Sentencing the couple, Lord Pentland said the motive had been money. He said: "Neither of you seen to have taken into account the enormous damage Class A drugs cause in communities throughout the country." </body>

      <body>Scotland's main political parties are all fielding candidates in the Scottish Parliament's Dunfermline by-election. Nominations have now closed for the contest taking place on 24 October. Labour picked Cara Hilton; Shirley-Anne Somerville is standing for the SNP; the Lib Dems' candidate is Susan Leslie and the Tory choice is James Reekie. The election is being held to replace former MSP Bill Walker who was jailed for 12 months after being found guilty of 23 domestic abuse charges. The 71-year-old, from Alloa, had denied attacking three former wives and a step-daughter between 1967 and 1995, but was found guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court. As well as the main political parties, the Scottish Green Party is fielding candidate Zara Kitson and Peter Adams is standing for the UK Independence Party and John Black is standing as an independent. Labour's Ms Hilton currently represents the Dunfermline South ward on Fife Council. She said the constituency needed an MSP who "would work their socks off". Ms Leslie, representing the Lib Dems, is also a Fife councillor. She said she would work with her party leader Willie Rennie to make sure Dunfermline and west Fife got the service it deserved. The SNP's Ms Somerville was an MSP for Lothians between 2007 to 2011. She pledged to be a "strong local voice" in Holyrood if she was elected. Tory candidate, Mr Reekie, was his party's representative for the Dunfermline constituency at the 2011 Holyrood election. He has pledged to fight measures which have hampered businesses in the constituency. Nominations for the election closed at 16:00. </body>

      <body>A reward of up to £10,000 is being offered for information leading to the conviction of thieves who steal metal from electricity substations. Scottish Power Energy Networks' new campaign, Copped It, highlights the consequences of thefts in and around substations and power lines. The campaign has been launched in response to a surge in thefts and attempted thefts of metal. There have been 1,435 incidents at the firm's substations since January 2011. According to the company, this has resulted in 140,000 homes put at increased risk of damage, 50,000 homes in Glasgow losing power for 30 minutes in November 2011 and the death of a 43-year-old man in July this year after an attempted theft from a substation in Lanarkshire. A Perthshire man and his pregnant wife also had a lucky escape this week when a surge caused by thieves stealing live overhead cables set their house on fire. Scottish Power said that about 11,000 hours had been spent on repairs and reinforcements. It said a maximum reward of £10,000 would be given to any member of the public whose information leads to the conviction of people who steal metal from the company. Chief executive Frank Mitchell said: "The worrying reality of this kind of criminal behaviour is the serious impact it can have on local communities. "As well as continuing to increase our own security and working closely with the police, we want to raise awareness of the threats posed by these kinds of thefts and we want to encourage people in communities to report any suspicious behaviour they see beside our power lines and substations. "We are happy to pay rewards for information that leads to criminal convictions, and we want to work closely with communities to help catch the criminals responsible for this dangerous activity." Any suspicious activity can be reported to Scottish Power via its 24-hour response line on 08452 727 999. Scottish Power Energy Networks is the licensed electricity distributor for central and southern Scotland and for Merseyside, Cheshire, North Wales and North Shropshire, with 30,000 substations, 40,000km overhead lines and 70,000km underground cables. </body>

      <body>Glasgow 2014 organisers are considering changing the venue of the Commonwealth Games netball final. The event is due to be held at the SECC but BBC Scotland has learned it may be switched to the newly-built Hydro facility nearby. In a statement, Glasgow 2014 officials confirmed they had "committed to conduct an operational feasibility assessment to see if it is possible". The change of venue could lead to 4,000 more tickets being made available. Should the Hydro be used, a quick turnaround would be required because the boxing finals are being held there the previous night, Saturday 2 August. A final decision will be made early next year. </body>

      <body>A mother-of-five who admitted storing drugs in her home to help her teenage son, after he was threatened in prison, has been jailed. The drugs were uncovered during a raid at Karen McCarthy's home in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, on 1 November last year. Amphetamine and a class A drug similar to a substance known as STP were found, with a street value totalling £92,500. The 45-year-old was jailed for 18 months at the High Court in Edinburgh. The judge heard how police had obtained a warrant to search McCarthy's home in Mountblow, after a tip-off. The search uncovered bags and plastic containers of white paste and white powder among the family foodstuffs in the kitchen freezer. McCarthy, who pled guilty to being concerned in the supply of the drugs, had worked with a voluntary group trying to help people beat addiction. Judge Lord Burns said: "I appreciate you did not know exactly what it was." He added: "There is a strong public interest in dealing with people who join in the chain of supply, as you did, by providing a safe house." </body>

      <title>Bid for fuel discount in rural towns</title>
      <description>A fuel discount that applies to the Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly could be extended to remote and rural parts of the UK mainland.</description>

      <body>A fuel discount scheme in the Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly could be extended to 10 rural communities in mainland Scotland and England. The UK has applied to the European Commission (EC) for a 5p a litre reduction in fuel duty in those places. They are Acharacle, Achnasheen, Appin, Carrbridge, Dalwhinnie, Gairloch and Strathpeffer. Kirkby-in-Furness in Cumbria, Hawes in North Yorkshire and Lynton in Devon are also included. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said that, as a Highlander, he knew "all too well that fuel prices tend to be highest in areas where a car is needed the most". "We've already delivered a tax cut for remote islands and now want to extend that to mainland rural areas that suffer from similarly high prices to the islands," he added. "We have put together the strongest possible evidence base to try and maximise the places that get it." A decision from the EC is expected next year. "As I've said before, it won't be easy to get this agreed with the commission, but I will do everything I can to make this happen," Mr Alexander said. The 10 locations selected for the application have higher pump prices than in areas that already receive discount, are more than 100 miles by road from the nearest refinery and have a population density lower than 135 people per square km. Pete Williams, RAC head of external affairs, said the application was "good news" because many people in rural communities were "unfairly penalised by high fuel prices as they rely on their cars for work and day-to-day life". "It's also understandable that fuel retailers in these remote areas are selling petrol and diesel at higher prices due to increased distribution costs from being so far from refineries," he added. "Let's hope the European Commission will see the sense in easing the pain for these rural towns when they come to make their decision next year." Labour Treasury spokeswoman Catherine McKinnell said she hoped the announcement would bring relief for drivers in the selected areas. But she added: "Eight out of 10 of these areas have Liberal Democrat MPs - including two in Danny Alexander's own constituency. The public will want to be reassured this is no more than a coincidence because nobody will thank a Lib Dem Treasury minister who refuses to tackle the cost-of-living crisis everywhere but his own back yard." Mr Alexander told BBC Breakfast it was "total nonsense" to suggest the plans were designed to favour seats held by his party. The idea had been put forward by his party in its election manifesto, he said, but the locations had been chosen "according to a strict selection criteria". He said it "would be nice to have a longer list" but the 10 communities chosen had a "reasonable chance of being agreed". Introduced in March 2012, the discount currently applies to the Hebrides, Northern Isles, islands in the Clyde and the Isles of Scilly as well as other island communities in Europe. Retailers register with HM Revenue and Customs to claim 5p a litre relief on fuel for sale to the public. </body>

      <body>A charity worker who stole thousands of pounds from vulnerable pensioners has been jailed for two-and-a-half years. Philip Muirhead, 36, from Aberdeen, went to Cuba and also bought a car using some of the money, after taking and cashing cheques from two people. He was working as an advocate at a support centre at Royal Cornhill Hospital. Muirhead admitted 10 charges of theft committed between 2008 and 2010 when he appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court The court heard he considered suicide after being caught. Defence agent Gregor Kelly said: "Mr Muirhead succumbed to temptation to dig himself out of financial difficulties. "There was a window of opportunity and he took that and he will regret it for the rest of his life. "His financial position unravelled during the time near the end of the offences although he admits that he did use some of the money for the car and the holiday." Mr Kelly added: "He panicked with regard to attending court. "He simply couldn't face up to reality - he had a clearly thought out a suicide plan and made his way to the Forth Road Bridge." Sheriff William Summers said: "You were employed in a position of trust and you abused that trust - that was shameless and despicable. "All the money you have stolen has been squandered. "These were not sophisticated thefts but they were carried out in an utterly deceitful and heartless way." </body>

      <body>Renewable energy developer RES UK has welcomed a decision by the Scottish government to clear its plans for a wind farm in the Scottish Borders. RES had lodged an appeal over its 15-turbine Penmanshiel wind farm plans after a dispute with the local council. The company claimed Scottish Borders Council failed to decide on the firm's application within required timescales. The project was cleared after RES cut the number of turbines to 14 on visual impact grounds. Last year, Scottish Borders Council said it would "vigorously defend" the RES appeal. The company maintained the project had been in planning for nearly a year without a decision being made by the council. However, a council spokesman said at the time that RES had not responded to requests to adjust its plans. RES said on Wednesday that Penmanshiel would make an important contribution to Scotland's energy targets and deliver significant benefits to the local community. Project manager Ruth Elder said: "We are delighted with the positive decision made by the Scottish government today and we are pleased that through the removal of one turbine the project has been allowed to proceed." RES said the local community at Penmanshiel would receive a benefits package of £5,000 per installed megawatt once the wind farm is operational. </body>

      <body>Police have released the descriptions of three men and a van they hope to trace in connection a missing sculpture that is said to be worth £3m. The bronze piece by Henry Moore which was stolen from the Glenkiln Sculpture Park in Lincluden Estate near Shawhead. Police said a blue Ford Transit-style van and its three occupants were seen at the park on two occasions before the artwork was taken last week. The men have been described as being in their 20s or 30s. Police Scotland said they were of average height and build. One had ginger, shaven hair and was wearing a red or orange waterproof jacket. The men had a collie-type dog and the van was described as being of an unusual shade of blue. Police said the men may have had legitimate business in the area and have appealed for them to contact the force. Det Insp Colin Burnie, the officer leading the enquiry, said Police Scotland was "delighted" with the public response to the investigation. He added: "We now require further help to identify this blue van and occupants and would again ask the public to call us if they have any information which may help us." The missing sculpture, called the Standing Figure, is believed to be worth up to £3m according to police. It was one of four pieces by Moore at the Glenkiln Sculpture Park. The remaining major pieces at the site have since been moved into secure storage for their safety. Standing Figure is among a number of works by the abstract artist, who died in 1986 aged 88, to be targeted by thieves in recent years. Last November, a Henry Moore sculpture worth up to £500,000 was taken from the Henry Moore Foundation at Much Hadham, Hertfordshire. Two men later admitted stealing The Sundial sculpture, which they then sold for £46. </body>

      <title>UK inmates lose right to vote ruling</title>
      <description>Convicted murderers Peter Chester and George McGeoch lose their UK Supreme Court battle over the right to vote while in jail.</description>

      <body>The Supreme Court has dismissed appeals from two prisoners over the right to vote under European Union rules. Convicted murderers Peter Chester and George McGeoch had argued that EU law gave them a right to vote - even though they cannot under British law. Prime Minister David Cameron told the Commons that the ruling was "a great victory for common sense". The European Court of Human Rights has previously told the UK to end the blanket ban on prisoners voting. Parliament is considering legislation, but has not yet decided what to do. Following the Supreme Court's judgement, the BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman said: "Critically it ruled that EU law did not provide an individual right to vote, paralleling that recognised by the ECHR. Eligibility under EU law is a matter for national parliaments." Convicted prisoners in the UK are banned from voting on the basis that they have forfeited that right by breaking the law and going to jail. Successive governments have wanted to maintain that position but the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) said a blanket ban on prisoners voting was disproportionate. Peter Chester raped and strangled his niece in Blackpool in 1977 and was jailed for life for her murder. He has served his minimum term but the Parole Board has refused to release him because it says he is too dangerous. In 2008, he tried to join the electoral roll so that he could vote in the elections for the European Parliament. The Ministry of Justice said he could not until the law was changed. In the second case, George McGeoch, serving life in a Scottish prison, argued that EU law allowed him to vote in local and European elections. Although the ECHR has already told the UK to change the law, these two cases focused on whether prisoners as EU citizens have a right to vote even if Westminster says differently. Last year, the government conceded that it would have to change the law to allow some prisoners to vote. Ministers have published a draft bill which is being considered by Parliament. The proposals include limiting the vote to inmates who are serving either less than six months or four years. A further 2,352 inmates have tried to bring voting cases to the European Court of Human Rights. Those applications are adjourned while judges wait to see what Westminster does. </body>

      <body>Five bikes worth thousands of pounds have been stolen from a property in Longforgan on the outskirts of Dundee. Police said a car seen driving away from the house in the early hours of Thursday may have been stolen from the Charleston area of Dundee. Thieves stole three mountain bikes and two mini motorbikes after breaking into a shed and garage. Police are trying to trace three men seen at the Longforgan property before driving off in a car. A yellow Scott Gambler-make downhill mountain bike worth £4,000, a grey KTM downhill bike worth £2,200 and a brown Absolute-make bike worth £800 were stolen. All of the bikes had been heavily customised. Also taken were two red Macbor mini motorbikes worth a total of £1,400. A quad bike was also stolen, but later found nearby. The thefts were thought to have happened sometime between 22:30 on Wednesday and 07:30 on Thursday. Police said three men were seen acting suspiciously at the property at about 02:15 on Thursday. They have been described as being aged in their early 20s, were about 5ft 8in tall, slim and had short brown hair. One of them was wearing a black jacket and grey hooded top. They were seen getting into a dark coloured car and driving off along Patterson Street. The car could be a Mazda 626, registration X485 NSS, that was taken from Buttars Loan Service Station in Buttars Loan, Dundee, at about 12:45 on Thursday. A second vehicle that was taken from the garage - a silver Peugeot Partner taxi - was found in Charleston on Thursday afternoon. </body>

      <body>Prince William has hosted his first investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace. Among those honoured were Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, who was presented with an OBE. It represented an extension of the Duke of Cambridge's public duties after he left the Royal Air Force last month. Standing in for the Queen, William presented awards recognising achievements in a wide range of fields to recipients from across the UK. Andy Murray was on time for the ceremony despite tweeting that he had been held up by a random drugs test. "In the middle of a drug test hahaha I'm goin to be late!!!" he wrote. Vicar Of Dibley producer Jon Plowman was also made an OBE by the prince, while broadcaster Aled Jones became an MBE for services to music, broadcasting and charity. Conservationist Helen Butler received an MBE. Around 25 such ceremonies are held every year, either in the ballroom at Buckingham Palace, the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh or at Windsor Castle. The majority are hosted by the Queen but some investitures are carried out by the Prince of Wales or Princess Royal. Prince William already carries out engagements connected to his charitable interests and those of the Royal Foundation he is joint patron of with the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Following the end of a military career that has occupied the prince since January 2006, the full shape of his public duties has yet to be decided. The next year has been described as "transitional" by palace officials as the duke prepares to become a full-time royal. He plans to expand his conservation work, particularly on the protection of endangered species, through his Royal Foundation. </body>

      <title>Poverty gap 'causing unjust deaths'</title>
      <description>The gap between rich and poor is leading to thousands of unnecessary deaths in Scotland, health experts say.</description>

      <body>The gap between rich and poor is leading to thousands of unnecessary deaths in Scotland, health experts say. NHS Health Scotland examined 30 years of health trends and found large differences in preventable causes of death across social groups. Director of Public Health Science Andrew Fraser said these patterns of death were not inevitable. NHS Health Scotland called for action to tackle inequality and not just the recognised causes of disease. The organisation's report noted that decreasing periods of health inequality had previously been observed in the UK, suggesting the situation could change. It said there was an urgent need for action to address inequalities in "income, resources and power" across society. The report showed that the gap in deaths across different social groups for specific causes decreased, while others emerged. It revealed that there was little difference in death rates from non-preventable diseases such as brain and ovarian cancer, but large differences in more preventable causes like alcohol-related deaths and heart disease. The common factor suggested for the persistence of health inequalities was social inequalities. Dr Gerry McCartney, head of the public health observatory at NHS Health Scotland, said: "Health inequalities represent thousands of unnecessary and unjust deaths per year across almost all social groups in Scotland. "The reason that health inequalities did not fall as particular causes were successfully tackled may be because individuals with more resources were able to protect themselves against new threats to health." Mr Fraser added: "We need a debate and action that helps us to agree answers to the question 'What would it take to eradicate health inequalities?'. "The answers lie in tackling the causes of inequalities, and not just the recognised causes of disease. "Patterns of death that are evident in this report are the end-points of circumstances that span Scottish life rather than focus on a particular disease group. Prevention is achievable, and inequalities are not inevitable. "We can anticipate that the burden of healthcare facing the NHS, communities and families will become progressively greater if we, as a country, don't provide the answers." </body>

      <body>Leading philanthropists from across the world have been recognised for their work at a special ceremony in the Scottish Parliament. Scottish entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter was among six people to receive the Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy. The medal is awarded biannually to those who use their private wealth and business acumen for public good. They were granted the award for their support for education, science, entrepreneurship and the arts. Sir Tom is only the second Scot to receive the award, after Kwik-Fit founder Sir Tom Farmer. Other recipients of the medal this year included the founder of the second largest telecoms business in Russia, Dr Dmitry Zimin. American hedge fund manager Dr James Harris Simons - along with his wife, economist Dr Marilyn Simons - also received medals, as did Dame Janet Wolfson de Botton on behalf of the Wolfson family, which set up the Wolfson Foundation. The foundation was named after Glasgow-born business leader and philanthropist Sir Isaac Wolfson, who died in 1991. The daughter of Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, chairwoman of the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development, accepted a medal on her mother's behalf. The ceremony has only been held outside the United States once before - also at the Scottish Parliament in 2005. In that same year, Sir Tom Hunter was knighted for services to entrepreneurship and philanthropy. The son of an Ayrshire shop owner, he started his first business selling sports shoes from the back of a van with a £5,000 loan from his father. He later built his Sports Division business into Europe's largest independent sports retailer and eventually sold it in 1998 for £290m. Sir Tom and his wife Lady Marion went on to establish The Hunter Foundation (THF). Previous medal recipients include the Rockefeller Family, the Gates Family, the Sainsbury Family, the Cadbury Family, George Soros and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Holyrood's Presiding Officer Tricia Marwick said: "Earlier this week, the parliament opened an exhibition exploring the legacy of Andrew Carnegie's philanthropy over the past 100 years. "Today, we welcomed modern philanthropists to our chamber, people who have followed in Carnegie's footsteps and used their wealth to make a positive difference to society. "I am sure Carnegie would have enjoyed today's ceremony and I hope the stories of the medallists will help inspire the next generation of philanthropists." This year's ceremony also marked the centennial of the establishment of the Carnegie UK Trust. The trust is named after Dunfermline-born industrialist Andrew Carnegie, whose family emigrated to the US from a life of poverty in Scotland in 1848. He made his fortune in steel, becoming the world's richest man, and eventually gave away billions of pounds to fund a network of global foundations. </body>

      <body>Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond will publicly debate with key figures in the No to independence campaign, his deputy Nicola Sturgeon has said. But she added that the SNP leader remained keen to go head-to-head with Prime Minister David Cameron. Ms Sturgeon made her comments on the BBC's Daily Politics show. Mr Cameron dismissed suggestions that he should take part in a televised debate with Mr Salmond in the run up to the referendum next year. Voters in Scotland will go to the polls on Thursday, 18 September, 2014, when they will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?" Daily Politics presenter Andrew Neil asked Ms Sturgeon if she could give a commitment that Mr Salmond would debate with new Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael, and head of Better Together, Alistair Darling. She replied: "I am sure that between now and the referendum Alex Salmond will debate with both of those people and many others, making the positive case for independence. There is no issue or question about that." But Ms Sturgeon added: "The real question is why will David Cameron not agree to debate with Alex Salmond? What is he running scared of? That is the unanswered question. "I've already debated with Alistair Darling. I've debated with Michael Moore. Alex Salmond will debate with lots of people between now and the referendum, but the first and foremost point here is that there should be that debate between the first minister and the prime minister." Better Together claimed Ms Sturgeon's comments were a "U-turn". A spokesman said: "It is good news that Nicola Sturgeon has finally confirmed that Alex Salmond has backed down and will now have a live TV debate with Alistair Darling. Now that both sides have agreed, it's time for the campaigns to get on and make this happen." Mr Cameron made his position clear when he appeared on the BBC's Andrew Marr show last month. He told the broadcaster: "Alex Salmond wants the question to be about anything other than the question. "So he would like the debate to be the SNP versus the Tory Party or Scotland versus England. It's not - it's a debate between Scots. "What it should be is between Alistair Darling, leader of the No campaign, and Alex Salmond, leader of the Yes campaign." </body>

      <title>Salmond urges Grangemouth resolution</title>
      <description>The first minister calls on both sides involved in the dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant to return to normal production.</description>

      <body>Management and unions have been urged by Scotland's first minister to get Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical plant fired up again. Alex Salmond wants a written pledge that Unite will not strike this year, and at the same time, for owners Ineos to restart operations and return the site to normal production. The facility remains shut down despite Unite calling off a planned strike. Mr Salmond met representatives of Ineos and Unite on Thursday evening. He said there was a long way to go but he believed both sides wanted "a great future for Grangemouth". He called for Unite to swiftly confirm in writing its willingness to provide a guaranteed period of normal working to 31 December and urged Ineos to fulfil its parallel commitment to fire up the plant and return to normal production. Mr Salmond said this would provide the right atmosphere for the necessary consultations and negotiations to build a secure future for the plant. "From my discussions tonight with both parties in this dispute I believe both are sincerely committed to create a great future for Grangemouth," he said. "I believe that whilst there will be a long way to go, I believe that acceptance of my proposal tonight would be an essential first step in this process." At the SNP's conference in Perth earlier he told delegates: "Governments can't make agreements" in such disputes but can "encourage the circumstances in which agreements can be found." Ineos said shutting down the Grangemouth complex had cost the company £20m so far. However, it reported that its power station at the site - which supplies steam to a neighbouring North Sea pipeline system - was continuing to operate despite the shutdown. The company said fuel was still being sent by tanker from Grangemouth to filling stations in Scotland and the north of England and that stocks of refined fuel at the site remained high, with more being brought in. Ineos has put proposals over pay and pensions to workers at the complex, which has 1,400 employees and many more contractors. A letter outlining the proposed changes was being couriered to employees on Friday. BBC Scotland has been given details of the offer, which includes freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016. The shift allowance would also be reduced from £10,000 to £7,500 per year, while pensions would be transferred from a final salary to a defined benefits scheme. The company added that no job cuts were expected. It has asked for an answer to the proposals by Monday, and has said shareholders will discuss the complex's future on Tuesday. The company has said Grangemouth is "financially distressed" and must reduce costs. It has also asked for guarantees that no further strike action will be held by workers. Unite claimed the company had told staff they could lose their jobs and be reemployed on poorer terms unless they agreed to give up their final salary pension, and accept pay freezes and pay cuts, by 18:00 on Monday. Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scottish secretary, said: "This is cynical blackmail from a company that is putting a gun to the heads of its loyal workforce to slash pay, pensions and jobs. "We are considering taking legal action over the company's menacing tactics and urge members not to be threatened into signing their livelihoods away. "It is increasingly clear that the company is deliberately generating a dispute and hiding behind fancy accounting to attack its own workforce." Unite is holding a protest vigil outside the plant during daylight hours. On Wednesday, Ineos said Grangemouth "is shut and remains shut", despite Unite calling off a 48-hour strike that had been due to begin on Sunday. The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans. Ineos claims it is unable to immediately restart the complex, which had been shut down ahead of the planned strike. A spokesman said: "The Grangemouth site is three times the size of the City of London and it is an incredibly complex system of manufacturing plants all connected by miles of pipes carrying highly flammable materials. "Shutting down the site and restarting again is not like switching the lights off and on. It takes days to shut down properly and it takes weeks to bring it back up again. "When Unite forced us to shut down in 2008 we had two major incidents and it took eight weeks to get back to normal. In the first incident, we had a large fire on a compressor. If our employees had been close to the area then there would have been serious injuries or even fatalities." </body>

      <title>Scottish Gas rise hits north hardest</title>
      <description>Scottish Gas customers in the north of Scotland are facing higher fuel bills than the rest of the UK, following a move by the energy firm to increase prices.</description>

      <body>Scottish Gas customers in the north of Scotland are facing higher bills than the rest of the UK, after a decision by owners Centrica to increase prices. The price rise will see an average UK dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November. But regional differences mean domestic customers living north of Perth will see an average rise of 11.2% - the biggest in the UK. Customers in the south of Scotland will see an average increase of 9.5%. The smallest rise is a 6.8% increase in the south west of England. Scotland's electricity transmission network is split between Scottish Hydro in the north and Scottish Power which holds the licence for central and southern Scotland. Centrica, which owns the British Gas and Scottish Gas brands, said its regional price differences reflected variations in the network costs it was obliged to pay to the transmission companies around the country. Rival SSE has already announced an 8.2% increase in bills from 15 November. The Centrica move, which will affect nearly eight million people in the UK, includes an average 8.4% rise in gas prices and a 10.4% increase in electricity prices. The company said it "understands the frustration" of prices rising faster than incomes. The average annual household bill will go up by £123. On average, UK customers will see a dual-fuel bill increase to £1,444 a year. Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. Energy regulator Ofgem said prices were determined by suppliers competing in the British energy market and it was up to them to justify their prices and profits to consumers. An Ofgem spokeswoman said: "Any price rise will not be welcomed by customers which is why it is important that Scottish Gas fully explain the reasons for the increase. "Energy suppliers should be doing all they can to minimise the impact of these rising costs on energy bills by ensuring they are managing their costs as efficiently as possible. "Suppliers must also ensure they are giving customers all the advice and help they need to save money on their energy bills, for example through energy efficiency." </body>

      <description>Business confidence is rising across all sectors in Scotland but the economic recovery remains frail, a survey of firms suggests.</description>

      <body>Business confidence is rising across all sectors in Scotland but the economic recovery remains frail, a survey of firms has suggested. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCC) found manufacturing orders rose in the third quarter at their highest rate for six years. Manufacturers and retailers also forecast a rise in profitability in the first half of next year. But SCC warned it was "by no means yet certain" the recovery can be sustained. On Wednesday, figures released by the Scottish government indicated Scotland's economy grew by 0.6% between April and June this year - the fourth consecutive quarter of growth north of the border. Labour market statistics also showed employment in Scotland at its highest level for five years. SCC's latest business survey, which is conducted in conjunction with the University of Strathclyde's Fraser of Allander Institute, found employment trends improving in all main sectors in the third quarter of 2013. Manufacturing orders also rose at their highest rate since the third quarter of 2007. Construction orders on balance declined, but levels remained higher than during the same period a year ago. The survey also suggested the long-term decline in retail sales had ended. The good summer boosted visitors to Scottish hotels, with more than half of businesses reporting a rise in guests. SCC chief executive Liz Cameron said the latest survey showed "welcome signs of growth" for Scotland's economy. She said: "Compared to a year ago, business confidence has increased and all business trends in all sectors are stronger, showing positive steps towards sustained economic growth. "There are encouraging signs of increased consumer activity, with improving retail sales and stronger tourism trends. This is good news for Scotland and for Scotland's businesses. "The manufacturing sector has seen orders rise at the highest rate since 2007, construction respondents reported a rise in investment intentions and the long-term decline in retail sales ended, with retailers reporting increased optimism for the first time since 2006." She added: "However, economic vulnerability remains. "Much depends on continuing positive trends in our major export markets and on speedy resolution of any remaining US fiscal issues. "Importantly, prices and wages remain disconnected and so household incomes continue to be squeezed. "This creates risk in reliance on a consumer-driven economy, which is why government rhetoric about investment and sustainability needs to become a reality to enable continued growth and confidence." </body>

      <body>Andy Murray says he will compete in the Australian Open only if he is "100% fit" following back surgery. The Wimbledon champion began his rehabilitation last week after a disc operation last month. Murray, 26, will miss the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London but wants to be ready for the first Grand Slam of 2014 in Melbourne in January. "I hope so, but I'm not going to come back unless I'm 100% fit. I've got a long way to go yet," said the Scot. "I've been in the swimming pool and on the bike a little bit but it's still going to be four or five weeks until I'm back on the tennis court hitting some balls. "The rehab process is pretty tedious and long and I don't want to come back too soon and have to start that process all over again. I'll only come back when I'm 100% fit and I hope that's at the beginning of the year." Murray, who received an OBE from Prince William at Buckingham Palace on Thursday, pulled out of the French Open in May because of his back problems. The world number four recovered in time to become Britain's first male Wimbledon singles' champion since 1936. His defence of the US Open ended in the quarter-finals, but he helped Great Britain beat Croatia in the Davis Cup before surgery. </body>

      <body>Malky Mackay says he was never asked to step down as Cardiff City manager during a fraught fortnight at the Premier League club. The Scotsman was known to be upset at club owner Vincent Tan's decision to axe head of recruitment Iain Moody. Mackay also stressed that they were "under budget" on transfers despite a summer of heavy recruitment. "Under no circumstances was I asked to resign and at no time have I thought of resigning from the club," Mackay said. Mackay added: "I've read various things in the last couple of weeks and I just need to clarify this, that we absolutely are under budget this summer. "I'm really sorry for the fans and what they've been through over the last couple of weeks. "It's been a difficult time for them where their club has been in the spotlight for non-footballing matters, so I absolutely feel where they're coming from. "Obviously it's as a result of Iain Moody leaving the club and Iain is someone who is absolutely a class act, as far as I'm concerned. "He was very impressive in the job that he's done for the football club and... he's had a huge part to play in the restructuring of my squad. "He brought in over 20-odd players, so he's got a huge part to play in the recent success. "He's someone that everyone here... that works for the football club will sadly be missed by them and he leaves with my utmost gratitude and respect. "I think our loss will be someone's huge gain in football." Former Watford manager Mackay met the club's board on Monday after the removal of Moody, who has been replaced by 23-year-old Alisher Apsalyamov. The Kazakh was on work experience at the club in the summer and is a friend of owner Tan's son. In a statement from the Cardiff board on Tuesday, the club said that transfer dealings will be conducted "subject to the manager's final approval". </body>

      <title>Glasgow boss eyes English league</title>
      <description>Glasgow City manager Laura Montgomery wants the Scottish champions to move to the English Women's Super League.</description>

      <body>Glasgow City manager Laura Montgomery has repeated her desire for the club to play in England's Super League. The question arose again after Wednesday victories set up an all-British tie against Arsenal in the Women's Champions League last 16. "We have made that known before," Montgomery told BBC Radio 5 live. "But, at the moment, it doesn't seem possible." The Football Association says present rules do not permit Glasgow to enter. But, as far as the Scottish FA is concerned, Glasgow are free to pursue the idea as the club are not members of the governing body north of the border. Glasgow have dominated the Scottish Women's Premier League, this month securing their seventh straight title and finishing the season with a 17-point lead over second-top Hibernian. And they view joining the English set-up as a way of guaranteeing tougher competition every week. "Why not from our point of view?" said Montgomery. "We have been so successful in Scotland and we see how successful the Super League is down there. "And it does make us quite envious up here of wanting to be part of that and I think Glasgow City would compete." There is a precedent, with Dutch outfit Twente, who Glasgow defeated in the group stage, and Belgian side Standard Liege, who lost 5-3 on aggregate to the Scots this week, playing in a cross-border league set-up. It is the second year running that Glasgow have reached the last 16 and they will be looking to avoid a similar scoreline to last season at this stage. The Scots were thrashed 17-0 on aggregate by former European champions, Turbine Potsdam. Arsenal, who completed an 18-2 hammering of Kazakh side CSHVSM-Kairat this week, are ranked fourth in Europe - one place behind Glasgow's German conquerors from last term - and will be a further test of Glasgow's progress and quality. "From a British and fans' point of view, it's a fantastic tie and, for ourselves, from a football view, Arsenal are one of the top sides in Europe," added Montgomery. "We've never not reached the quarter-finals, they have been in the semis of the Champions League for the last three years in a row, they are former winners, so it's a very challenging tie for us. "But it's certainly one to savour and one we are very much looking forward to. "The bet is clearly with Arsenal, given their track record and the quality side they are. "But never discount the underdog, nothing is impossible in football." Adding intrigue to the tie is the presence of Scotland midfielder Kim Little, forward Emma Mitchell and midfielder Caroline Weir in an Arsenal squad managed by fellow Scot Shelley Kerr. </body>

      <description>The pensioners who are taking ballet lessons</description>

      <body>More and more pensioners are taking up ballet, according to the Royal Academy of Dance. It is putting the phenomenon down to the popularity of TV programmes like Strictly Come Dancing. In a locker room at Scottish Ballet, a group of dancers are lacing up their ballet shoes. Only one thing marks them out from the other dancers here. These dancers are all in their 60s and 70s. Today, they are rehearsing Swan Lake. Among them is Alicia Steele. She danced when she was young. Now, nearly 80, she's back. "I went to keep fit classes, but I found them a bit boring," she says. "And I love the music with the piano. I just love it and it makes you feel a bit young again. It doesn't make you look young, but it makes you feel young inside." There's been a 70% jump in the number of adult dancers signing up for classes in recent years, according to the Royal Academy of Dance. Some, like Alicia, danced when they were young. Others are complete beginners. Their oldest ballerina is 102. Preston Clare, teacher of the Scottish Ballet's Regenerate group, says he has been astonished by the change he has seen in his older pupils. "The amazing thing with these ladies is they've grown," he says. "They've stopped slouching now and it's just fantastic to see the difference in them. "They're opening up completely and able to feel more confident in themselves." The lessons at Scottish Ballet have proved so popular, they have added extra classes, and they still have a waiting list. Ballet is good for muscles, balance and memory, but 68-year-old Alison Templeton says it is not just the physical challenge she comes for. "A number of the ladies have lost husbands this year, including myself, and the support of the other ladies is just remarkable," she says. "It does help, and it gives you a focus to go out in the week and do something." Marlene Gillespie, 71, says she absolutely loves the experience. "I can't wait to come," she says. "I love the music. I love the exercise. "We have good days, bad days, we've all been through different things. And I just think it's a wonderful way to exercise, especially for elderly people." Renee Gillespie, 75, adds: "You know you can't really do what you're asked to do but you have great fun trying. And so it's good exercise, it's great fun and it's wonderfully sociable." While some senior citizens are taking on the classics, Dr Anne Hogan, from the Royal Academy of Dance, says for others there is the more gentle option of armchair ballet. "Dance is something that can be modified to all ages and all levels of experience," she says. "In the programme recently, when we trained people to work with older learners, they went into situations in some of the care homes where you had people who had to be seated the entire class, but had a great dance class. "There's lots of movement that can be adapted to people's needs." Following the Genee, the world's biggest dance competition, held in Glasgow last month, the Royal Academy of Dance is holding a week of free ballet lessons across Scotland in January. They hope it will get even more people spend their twilight years at the barre. </body>

      <body>The bitter industrial dispute which has broken out at Grangemouth has placed a spotlight on the giant refinery and petrochemicals complex. So what is the history behind the site, who runs it now and what operations are carried out there? When did the site start up? In 1924, BP opened a refinery on the Firth of Forth, in part because of its transport links and the availability of local labour skilled in shale oil refining. From the 1950s, BP's operations there grew to meet growing demand for both petrochemicals and fuels. The advent of a new source of crude oil feedstock in the shape of North Sea oil in the 1970s brought further business to the site. The refinery's feedstock is now mainly supplied by the neighbouring BP-operated Kinneil oil and gas processing plant. Some oil is imported to the site via pipeline from the deepwater Finnart Ocean Terminal, located about 60 miles west of Grangemouth. Who owns the complex? The petrochemicals part of the 1,700-acre site is run by Switzerland-based speciality chemicals and oil product manufacturer Ineos. It owns more than 50 manufacturing facilities in 11 countries across the world. In late 2005 Ineos bought BP's olefins and derivatives business, taking over the Grangemouth complex in the process. The crude oil refinery - the only one in Scotland - is now owned by Petroineos, a joint venture which was formed between Ineos and PetroChina International (London) Company in 2011. What is produced at Grangemouth? The Grangemouth refinery processes around 210,000 barrels of crude oil per day, producing more than nine million litres of clean fuels per day. The refinery, which has an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes, provides fuel to Scotland, Northern England and Northern Ireland. The refinery and chemical plants form Ineos' largest production centre. The petrochemicals facility at the site manufactures more than two million tonnes of chemical products per year. These are later transformed into essential items such as bottles and pipes, cabling and insulation and food packaging. What major equipment is there at the complex? At the heart of the petrochemicals site are two ethylene crackers - G4 and KG - which produce the feed materials used by other chemicals plants. The two units have an ethylene production capacity of one million tonnes per year between them. </body>

      <title>Digging deep on social mobility</title>
      <description>How young will 'pay the price' for lack of social mobility</description>

      <body>Alan Milburn says he was asked by the coalition to "hold its feet to the fire" in examining its progress on social mobility and child poverty. But just how much will his words hurt? In this, the first of what is planned to be an annual "State of the Nation report", the commission led by the former Labour health secretary concludes that "Britain remains a deeply divided country", one where "being born poor often leads to a lifetime of poverty". The commission says austerity has made it even harder to break ingrained cycles of poverty, that "disadvantage and advantage cascade down the generations". It warns there is a danger that social mobility will go in to reverse after rising in the middle of the last century and "flatlining" towards the end of it. The post-war years saw a big expansion of the middle classes, as the professional jobs market grew and more people bought their own homes, but there has been little change in the last quarter of the century. Mr Milburn said over decades, the UK had become a wealthier society, but had "struggled to become a fairer one" and had more children living in poverty and lower levels of social mobility than "many other developed nations". A total of 2.3 million children (one in six) live in poverty, he said, and this made it essential that the pattern where "birth not worth" determined a person's chances in life was changed. Higher social mobility had become "the new holy grail of public policy". It is certainly something all parties now say they want to see. The report from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission has stinging words on some areas of government policy but they are sweetened with praise for others, including the fact that the coalition continues to "stick to its commitments" on ending child poverty and improving social mobility in "challenging times". Mr Milburn told journalists at a news conference the government "deserved credit" for that. But the target of ending child poverty by 2020 - begun under Labour and continued by the coalition government - would "in all likelihood" be missed, he said. His most stinging criticism seemed to be about the way the young were likely to pay the highest price for a lack of social mobility and poverty during the global financial crisis. He called for older generations to be asked to dig deeper. The number of young people who have been unemployed for two years or more is at a "20-year high", he said. And there was an "inter-generational unfairness" in terms of who was being asked to pick up the bill in the recession. He did not call for pension cuts, but Mr Milburn said politicians should be prepared to "break political taboos" to talk about whether wealthier pensioners should lose benefits currently available to all - particularly the winter fuel allowance and the free TV licence. Pensioners were usually more worried about their grandchildren than themselves, he said. The commission is also looking to employers to do more - to offer better training, pay higher wages and open up professions to a wider pool of people. Two-thirds of children living in poverty, the report says, are living in homes with a working parent. Schools and universities were also urged to do more. He said schools in some areas were letting down pupils from poorer homes and those from middle-income homes too. Schools should give more help to low-achievers from middle-income homes as well as the poorest, while the government should improve careers advice, give extra incentives for teachers to teach in the worst schools and pay colleges "by results they achieve for their students in the labour market - not the numbers they recruit". As for universities - which were the focus of an earlier report by the commission - he says the sector as a whole has drawn in more students from poorer homes but top institutions remain out of reach for too many. Each year, he said, there were 3,700 "missing" state school pupils who had achieved the grades needed to get in to universities in the Russell Group (which represents some of the UK's leading universities) but did not go to them. The commission called for the government to put social mobility at the heart of its policies and practices, so that it was a "golden thread" running through all it did. It concentrated on the overall UK picture, but pointed out that in Scotland and Wales, the issue "currently has a low profile". In an age of austerity, the report's authors suggest creating a fairer society will be a job for all - and far from pain-free. </body>

      <body>Alex Salmond has called for concessions from both management and unions in a bid to break the deadlock in the industrial disputes over the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant, says the Scotsman. The Daily Record also leads with the refinery dispute. The paper says workers have claimed oil giants at Grangemouth will make half a billion profit by 2017 - and have not paid UK tax for five years. Households in the north and north east will bare the brunt of Scottish gas price rises, according to the Press and Journal. David Cameron's pledge to make the UK one of the world's leading five business-friendly countries is in crisis, according to top-level civil service warnings, reports the Herald. The new Queensferry Crossing will be toll free, says the Courier. The paper says Scotland's Finance Secretary John Swinney will make the announcement later.

      <title>Blow to multiple human species idea</title>
      <description>The earliest humans from two million years ago in Eurasia and Africa were all part of the same species, a study finds.</description>

      <body>The idea that there were several different human species walking the Earth two million years ago has been dealt a blow. Instead, scientists say early human fossils found in Africa and Eurasia may have been part of the same species. Writing in the journal Science, the team says that Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus are all part of a single evolving lineage that led to modern humans. But others in the field reject this. A team looked at the most complete hominid skull ever found, which was uncovered in Dmanisi, Georgia. It had a small braincase, large teeth and a long face, characteristics it shares with H. habilis. But many features from the braincase were also "unique" to H. erectus. The 1.8-million-year old skull comes from a site that has given up the biggest collection of well-preserved early-human remains known anywhere in the world. The Dmanisi collection also represents the earliest evidence of primitive humans outside Africa, a group that emerged soon after early Homo diverged from Australopithecus, or "Lucy". "We now have the best evidence for what early Homo really is," said lead author David Lordkipanidze from the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi, Georgia. "One of the most important things is that we have such a remarkable collection; it's very rare that you have that from one site." The fossil remains showed a lot of variation that had previously puzzled researchers, but Prof Lordkipanidze said it was clear that these features were all from one population. "When we looked at this variability and compared it with modern humans, you can see this is a normal range of variation," Prof Lordkipanidze told BBC News. The skull was uncovered eight years ago and since then the team has compared it to other Homo fossils found in Africa from as early as 2.4 million years ago. The comparative analysis of the hominid cranium revealed enough similarities for the team to consider the earliest Homo fossils as the same species as the Dmanisi hominids. A co-author of the study, Christoph Zollikofer from the Anthropological Institute and Museum in Zurich, Switzerland, said that if the braincase and the face of "Skull 5" had been found as separate fossils at different sites in Africa, they might have been attributed to different species. "That's because Skull 5 unites some key features, like the tiny braincase and large face, which had not been observed together in an early Homo fossil until now. "Furthermore, since we see a similar pattern and range of variation in the African fossil record, it is sensible to assume that there was a single Homo species at that time in Africa," Prof Zollikofer added. "And since the Dmanisi hominids are so similar to the African ones, we further assume that they both represent the same species." Other palaeoanthropologists, however, believe that at least three distinct species of humans co-existed in Africa. They include Fred Spoor from University College London. He told BBC News that the methods of analysis that the team used were not sufficient to infer that these fossils were the same species. "They do a very general shape analysis of the cranium which describes the shape of the face and braincase in broad sweeping terms," Prof Spoor Said. "The problem is that those Homo species are not defined using such a broad overview of what their general cranial shape is." He added that the very specific characteristics that had been used to define H. erectus, H. habilis and H. rudolfensis "were not captured by the landmarks that they used". "They did not consider that the thick and protruding brow ridges, the angular back of the braincase; and some details of the base of the cranium are derived features for H. erectus, and not present in H. habilis and H. rudolfensis." Chris Stringer at the Natural History Museum in London said that the team had made an excellent case "that this remarkable new skull, with its huge jawbone", was part of the natural variation of the Dmanisi population. But he said he was doubtful that all of the early Homo fossils could be "lumped into an evolving H. erectus lineage". "Only H. erectus survives and becomes successful but at the origin, nature was experimenting with how to evolve humans in terms of increasing brain size," Prof Stringer told BBC News. "Creatures were starting to use tools and eat meat, and this drove evolution, but I think it also drove diversity. The Dmanisi group is an example of the successful species that came out of that and then carried on to spread around the old world." </body>

      <title>'Missing' badgers: call for answers</title>
      <description>Conservationists are calling for an investigation into plummeting badger numbers in the run up to the cull.</description>

      <body>Conservationists are calling for an investigation into plummeting badger numbers in the run up to the cull. The apparent 50% decline over a year before the cull started appears to be unprecedented, data from other badger populations suggests. Government officials have blamed the cold winter, disease or lack of food for the dwindling numbers. But a wildlife charity claims illegal killing of badgers may behind the fall in numbers and is calling for answers. Meanwhile, reports on social networks suggest protestors have been interfering with the hair traps used to assess badger numbers. This could potentially lead to errors in population estimates. There have been three official attempts to count badgers in west Somerset and west Gloucestershire in the run up to the cull. The first estimate - in October 2012 - concluded there were 3,644 badgers in west Gloucestershire and 4,289 in west Somerset. This was revised down in February this year to 3,368 in west Gloucestershire and 2,473 in west Somerset. Then, just before the cull began, a new estimate of the badger population was produced of 2,350 badgers in west Gloucestershire and 1,450 badgers in west Somerset. The data suggests the population in both areas has fallen from around 8,000 badgers in October 2012, to around 4,000 badgers a year later, across both zones. Defra have given a number of reasons for the apparent 50% decline, including the impact of last winter's bad weather, disease and lack of food. "These badger populations go up and down," the environment secretary Owen Paterson said last week. "We're dealing with a wild animal, whose numbers will go up and down depending on weather, disease and other conditions." However, wildlife charities are concerned that illegal killing of badgers may be behind the fall in numbers. Last week, it was claimed that farmers in the Somerset cull zone had admitted to gassing badgers. The wildlife charity, Care for the Wild, is among those calling for an inquiry into the "missing" badgers. Policy officer Dominic Dyer said it was a serious issue and he would like to see more answers from the secretary of state. "A climate has been created which allows certain individuals to believe they can carry out illegal killing and will not get prosecuted," he said. "And I think that has got much worse over the past 12 months, and that's shared by many people in the wildlife conservation movement as well. "I don't think we have got an accurate feel now for what the numbers are - and we are continuing to cull, that is a very dangerous combination." Data on wild badger populations in England is sparse. However, two badger populations have been well studied - at Wytham Wood in Oxfordshire and at Woodchester Park in Gloucestershire. If factors such as poor weather and lack of food are behind the fall in badger numbers in the cull zones, similar fluctuations would be expected in neighbouring populations, say scientists. A Defra report summarising 25 years of population studies between 1982 and 2006 shows rises and falls in the badger population at Woodchester Park over this time period, but not on a level comparable with the fall reported over the past year. Defra has not given recent information on the badger population at Woodchester Park. But a source said that while badger populations at Woodchester Park do show fluctuations, the biggest change year-on-year is about 17%. Prof Rosie Woodroffe of the London Zoological Society has studied badgers for many years, including at Wytham Wood. She said the difference between last year's and this year's estimates of badger numbers in the cull zone was "very large by the standards of normal fluctuations in badger numbers". They "did not see fluctuations of the magnitude claimed for the Somerset and Gloucestershire cull zones" at Wytham Wood, Prof Woodroffe told the BBC. "I think it would be extremely unusual for such a decline to occur through natural causes - especially over such large areas. "Two possible explanations for the difference in numbers relate to problems with the estimation methods (which are rather opaque and have been subjected to interference by protestors), and to the possibility of illegal killing. "I don't think there's any way to distinguish between these two with the publicly available information, but I'd think either was more likely than a natural decline," she added. Robbie McDonald of the Environment and Sustainability Institute at the University of Exeter said it is hard to discern in any wildlife survey the degree to which observed change is due to genuine population change or error in estimates. He told BBC News: "In general, any estimate of a wildlife population comprises genuine change in that population and then error in population estimations. So there's both of those two things." Defra said in a statement that population estimates for Woodchester for 2013 are not available, and it would not be possible to carry out a comparison between Woodchester Park and the cull areas because the sizes of the areas are so different. "Fluctuations in numbers of wildlife populations occur for a range of complex reasons that it is difficult to assess," said a spokesperson. "We are not speculating on the causes for the drop in the badger population." A spokesperson for the NFU said: "The NFU has no evidence of the illegal killing of badgers. The NFU does not condone any illegal activity that results in the killing of wildlife. "Anyone with any evidence of the illegal killing of badgers or any other wildlife should report it to the police wildlife crime unit so it can be investigated." </body>

      <title>Monkeys 'take turns in conversation'</title>
      <description>Marmosets engage in what appears to be "polite conversation", taking it in turns to vocalise, according to researchers.</description>

      <body>Marmoset monkeys take it in turns to "talk" in a pattern very similar to human conversation, according to scientists. Researchers recorded the sounds of the marmosets as they called to one another from behind a curtain. Each animal would call, then wait for the other to respond before calling again. The results suggest an "alternative evolutionary route" for our own conversational turn-taking. They are reported in the journal Current Biology. It is something we take for granted in our conversations, but taking it in turns to talk and listen is crucial for us to effectively exchange information through what we say. Somewhat mysteriously though, we do not see an obvious origin in our closest primate relatives - the chimpanzees. Chimps are not very vocal and tend to use their repertoire of gestures to communicate, so it is widely accepted that these manual gestures provided the foundations for the co-operation inherent in our own communication. But Dr Asif Ghazanfar from Princeton University set out to look for evidence of a vocal route for this co-operation, by looking at vocal exchanges in marmosets. He explained that he chose marmosets precisely because, unlike chimps, they are very vocal. It is one of two main characteristics the monkeys share with humans, Dr Ghazanfar said. "They're [also] co-operative breeders - so they help one another take care of their offspring. "That's an important characteristic because it leads to greater pro-sociality (meaning the animals, like us, carry out behaviours that are intended to benefit others)." The lead researcher, Daniel Takahashi, recorded marmosets calling to one another from opposite corners of a room. The animals were separated by a curtain, so each could hear but not see the other. The recordings revealed that the marmosets would wait for about five seconds after the other finished calling to respond - seemingly following "unspoken rules of conversational etiquette". Dr Ghazanfar explained that there were two ideas for why the animals followed these rules. "One is, if you're out of sight of your group members and want to establish contact with another, you only know if you've established that contact if their response is contingent on your own," he explained to BBC News. "And the other hypothesis is that these calls they exchange might have information content [that needs to be digested]." Dr Ghazanfar says that our own conversational turn-taking might have evolved via a similar route - although on a parallel branch of the evolutionary tree. This provides an alternative explanation to the somewhat "mysterious step" it is suggested occurred as the patterns in chimp-like gestural exchanges evolved into the patterns of our own vocal communication. The team hopes that continued study of the marmosets will help to reveal more about why our own conversation can sometimes break down. "We are currently exploring how very early life experiences in marmosets - including those in the womb and through to parent-infant vocal interactions - can illuminate what goes awry in human communication disorders," said Dr Ghazanfar. </body>

      <body>Ugandan officials have seized some two tonnes (4,600lb) of ivory - one of the country's biggest such hauls for many years. The Uganda Wildlife Association (UWA) has said the 832 pieces of ivory could be worth up to $6.7m but other estimates put the value lower. Experts say some of the ivory is believed to have come from elephants poached outside Uganda. There is a huge demand for African ivory in Asia for use in ornaments. The ivory was apparently heading for the Kenyan port of Mombasa. Some of the tusks had been broken up and covered with plastic bottles in crates labelled as material to be recycled. The UWA told the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga that Uganda is increasingly being used as a transit country by poachers who kill elephants in states such as South Sudan or the Democratic Republic of Congo. Uganda is believed to have about 5,000 elephants and this haul would represent the tusks from about 400 animals. Last week, some four tonnes of ivory was found in Mombasa after coming from Uganda. According to the UWA, the rate of elephant poaching is relatively low in Uganda, with an estimated 20 elephants killed for their ivory across the country in 2010. After a sharp fall in the number of elephants in Africa, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) banned the trade in ivory in 1989 But in recent years poaching has increased across sub-Saharan Africa with criminal gangs slaughtering elephants for ivory markets in Asia. </body>

      <body>Despite being home to about 16,000 tree species, just 227 "hyperdominant" species account for half of Amazonia's total trees, a study suggests. An international team of researchers found that the region was, in total, home to an estimated 390 billion trees. Writing in Science, they added that the rarest 11,000 species made up only 0.12% of tree cover. However, they added that the new data could help unlock ecological secrets held by the biodiversity hotspot. The results were based on a survey of 1,170 plots and half-a-million trees across the six-million-square-kilometre area, often described as the lungs of the world. The authors said that the underlying cause of the hyper dominance of the 227 species, which accounted for 1.4% of the estimated number of species in the region, remained unknown. "We knew that, normally, a few species dominate ecosystems, but if you have a system that has 16,000 tree species but just 227 make up half of the trees, that was pretty surprising even for us," said lead author Dr Hans ter Steege from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands. He told the Science podcast: "We don't really know why these species are so incredibly dominant because they do not have any particular ecological feature that stands out." In the paper, Dr ter Steege and the team of more than 100 scientists wrote that there was no evidence that two key functional traits for trees - seed mass and wood density - played a part in determining what species dominated the landscape. "The 227 hyperdominant species include both shade-tolerant, typically large-seeded climax species with dense wood and shade-intolerant, small seeded pioneer (species) with light wood," they observed. The most dominant species was indentified as Euterpe precatoria, a palm tree native to central and southern America, with a mean estimate population of more than five billion individuals within Amazonia. Conversely, the researchers noted that the rarest 5,800 species had communities with fewer than 1,000 individuals, adding: "which is sufficient to classify those that are endemic as globally threatened". They suggested further analysis would show that the species identified as hyperdominant would be "disproportionately resistant to pathogens, specialist herbivores and other sources of frequency-dependent mortality". Dr ter Steege said the data could also be used by conservationists to find out what species were found in protected areas, such as national parks, and what ones were located in unprotected areas, and were therefore vulnerable to threat such as deforestation. </body>

      <title>Nepal mountain expansion bid stalls</title>
      <description>Nepal's bid to win international recognition for five 8,000m-plus mountain peaks has failed, the BBC has learnt.</description>

      <body>Nepal's bid to win international recognition for five 8,000m-plus mountain peaks has been put on hold, the BBC has learnt. India and Pakistan could not decide on the matter, causing the plan to stall at the International Mountaineering and Climbing Federation's annual meeting. The tall peaks are appealing to experienced mountaineers; climbing them can make it easier to secure sponsors. Mountaineering makes up a significant chunk of Nepal's earnings from tourism. Winning international recognition for the new peaks would set an important precedent for Nepal because it plans to open several other new peaks in the future to climbers. Some mountain routes, like those leading to Everest's summit, are also becoming crowded, prompting some to call for lesser known peaks to be opened up to climbers. Nepalese authorities had expected the UIAA to recognise the five new peaks during the apex mountaineering body's annual general meeting in Switzerland last week. Three of the peaks are on the world's third highest mountain, the Kanchenjunga massif, two of which are on Nepal-India border and one within Nepalese territory. The two other new peaks are on the Lhotse massif on Nepal-China border near Mount Everest. The highest of the new peaks, Yarlung Khang - also known as Kanchanjunga West - is 8,505m and is in Nepal. All new peaks are within the mountain massifs that already have Nepal's eight highest peaks above 8,000 meters including Everest and are already recognised internationally. Nepalese officials said they had already secured support from China for the five new peaks. "India and Pakistan are also quite positive but they said they needed more time to get this approved by their mountaineering bodies' general assemblies and therefore it could not happen during this meeting," said Ang Thsering Sherpa, past president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association and an honorary member of the UIAA. The UIAA initiated in 2012 what it calls the ARUGA project with an aim to see if new 8,000m-plus could feasibly achieve international recognition. Under that project, Nepal had tabled five new peaks and Pakistan one. "It wasn't possible to decide on this issue without getting the opinion and advice from the involved countries: China, India, Nepal and Pakistan," UIAA Mountaineering Commission President Pierre Humblet told BBC News. "Consequently I wrote to the UIAA member federations from those countries asking them to get in touch with their local authorities too. "I received a fast and positive answer from the Nepal Mountaineering Association and the national public authorities, the Chinese opinion seems to be also in favour of the Aruga project. "But the Indian Mountaineering Foundation and the Pakistan Alpine Club, still in touch with the national authorities, requested more time." The reasons cited for the two countries' indecision are different though. When approached by the BBC to ask if details that it had delayed a decision were correct and if so why, the president of the Indian Mountaineering Foundation, Colonel HS Chauhan, said: "That is one part [of the story] and I will not make any further comment." Knowledgeable sources said the issue was still debated in India and one of the reasons was because the Indian side of Kanchanjunga holds importance in the religious beliefs of the people of Sikkim in northeast India where that part of the mountain stands. Recognising the two border peaks means mountaineering from the Nepalese side would be allowed on them. Pakistani mountaineering officials said they could not decide on the proposal because they had no authority at present. "We were not in a position to decide on our own because during our last government, the ministry of tourism was devolved (to provinces) and now there isn't any authority at the federal level," said Karrar Haidri, member executive consul with the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the country's apex mountaineering body. "We are working on this with the government of Pakistan and hopefully we should be able to decide by the next general meeting of the UIAA." Having already sought international recognition for its own new 8,000m-plus peak on the Pakistan-China border, Pakistani authorities plan to introduce more such peaks. "There will be at least four new 8,000m peaks we will be putting forth for international recognition so there is no reason for us not to support Nepal's move," said Mr Haidri. Pakistan already has five 8,000m peaks, including the world's second highest mountain K2. The UIAA's Pierre Humblet said his organisation's management committee had decided to give up to three months to the Indian and Pakistani mountaineering federations. "Our management committee will then decide about the opportunity to submit the question to the next general assembly," he explained. Mr Sherpa said that if the proposal on the new peaks on Kanchenjunga still remained undecided then Nepal would seek international recognition for only three peaks - Lhotese Middle and Lhotse Shar - on the Nepal-China border and the Kanchanjunga, in the west of Nepal. He said many climbers these days attempt to climb these so-called "side peaks" by using completely different routes from those of the main peaks. "Climbers are doing new adventures, making new routes and accomplishing new achievements and it is our duty to make mountaineering exciting for the new generation," Mr Sherpa. Purna Chandra Bhattarai, Nepal's tourism ministry joint secretary who heads the mountaineering authority of the government: "We believe there are many such peaks in our Himalayas but we need to have a proper survey first. "We are developing a special project towards that end and it will be initiated soon." Mountaineering marked a significant chunk of Nepal's earnings of $360m from tourism last year although officials and mountaineering experts believe that figure can significantly jump if new peaks are opened. Nepalese officials say they are mindful that the addition of the new mountains should not challenge records set by past climbers who have climbed all 14 of the peaks above 8,000 metres worldwide. "It is important to keep a distinction between the historically recognised 8,000m-plus peaks and the newly recognised ones," said Mr Sherpa. "If someone wants to climb all the 14 highest mountains, they must climb the main peaks of each mountain and not the newly identified side peaks." </body>

      <title>Sleep 'cleans' the brain of toxins</title>
      <description>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins of a hard day's thinking, US researchers have demonstrated.</description>

      <body>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking, researchers have shown. The US team believe the "waste removal system" is one of the fundamental reasons for sleep. Their study, in the journal Science, showed brain cells shrink during sleep to open up the gaps between neurons and allow fluid to wash the brain clean. They also suggest that failing to clear away some toxic proteins may play a role in brain disorders. One big question for sleep researchers is why do animals sleep at all when it leaves them vulnerable to predators? It has been shown to have a big role in the fixing of memories in the brain and learning, but a team at the University of Rochester Medical Centre believe that "housework" may be one of the primary reasons for sleep. "The brain only has limited energy at its disposal and it appears that it must choose between two different functional states - awake and aware or asleep and cleaning up," said researcher Dr Maiken Nedergaard. "You can think of it like having a house party. You can either entertain the guests or clean up the house, but you can't really do both at the same time." Their findings build on last year's discovery of the brain's own network of plumbing pipes - known as the glymphatic system - which carry waste material out of the brain. Scientists, who imaged the brains of mice, showed that the glymphatic system became 10-times more active when the mice were asleep. Cells in the brain, probably the glial cells which keep nerve cells alive, shrink during sleep. This increases the size of the interstitial space, the gaps between brain tissue, allowing more fluid to be pumped in and wash the toxins away. Dr Nedergaard said this was a "vital" function for staying alive, but did not appear to be possible while the mind was awake. She told the BBC: "This is purely speculation, but it looks like the brain is losing a lot of energy when pumping water across the brain and that is probably incompatible with processing information." She added that the true significance of the findings would be known only after human studies, but doing similar experiments in an MRI machine would be relatively easy. Commenting on the research Dr Neil Stanley, an independent sleep expert, said: "This is a very interesting study that shows sleep is essential downtime to do some housekeeping to flush out neurotoxins. "There is good data on memory and learning, the psychological reason for sleep. But this is the actual physical and chemical reason for sleep, something is happening which is important." Dr Raphaelle Winsky-Sommerer, a lecturer in sleep at Surrey University, said: "It's not surprising, our whole physiology is changing during sleep. "The novelty is the role of the interstitial space, but I think it's an added piece of the puzzle not the whole mechanism. "The significance is that, yet again, it shows sleep may contribute to the restoration of brain cell function and may have protective effects." Many conditions which lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease are characterised by the build-up of damaged proteins in the brain. The researchers suggest that problems with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to such diseases, but caution more research is needed. The charity Alzheimer's Research UK said more research would be needed to see whether damage to the brain's waste clearance system could lead to diseases like dementia, but the findings offered a "potential new avenue for investigation". </body>

      <title>Air pollution causes cancer - WHO</title>
      <description>Pollutants in the air we breathe have been classed as a major cause of cancer by the World Health Organization.</description>

      <body>Pollutants in the air we breathe have been classed as a leading environmental cause of cancer by the World Health Organization. It said the evidence was clear they cause lung cancer. Sources of pollution include car exhausts, power stations, emissions from agriculture and industry - as well as heating in people's homes. The WHO said the classification should act as a strong message to governments to take action. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a part of the WHO, has now classed air pollution in the same category as tobacco smoke, UV radiation and plutonium. It said air pollution had been know to cause heart and lung diseases, but evidence had now emerged that it was also causing cancer. The IARC said the most recent data suggested 223,000 deaths from lung cancer around the world were caused by air pollution. More than half of the deaths were thought to be in China and other East Asian countries. Rapid industrialisation has led to smoggy skies in cities such as Beijing. However, it is a global problem and concerns about air pollution were raised in Europe again this week. Data suggests there may also be a link with bladder cancer. Dr Kurt Straif, from IARC, said: "The air we breathe has become polluted with a mixture of cancer-causing substances. "We now know that outdoor air pollution is not only a major risk to health in general, but also a leading environmental cause of cancer deaths." Cancer Research UK said it was not a surprise. Dr Julie Sharp, the head of health information at the charity, said: "It's important that people keep the risk from air pollution in perspective. "Although air pollution increases the risk of developing lung cancer by a small amount, other things have a much bigger effect on our risk, particularly smoking." Dr Rachel Thompson, head of research interpretation at the World Cancer Research Fund International, said: "This latest evidence confirms the need for government, industry and multinational bodies to urgently address environmental causes of cancer. "But there's also a lot we can do as individuals to lower our chances of developing the disease such as being more physically active and adopting a healthier diet." </body>

      <title>Badger cull falls short of target</title>
      <description>The number of badgers culled during a six-week scheme in Gloucestershire has fallen short of its target, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson tells MPs.</description>

      <body>The number of badgers shot during a six-week cull in Gloucestershire has fallen short of its target, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has told MPs. Defra said 708 badgers had been killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Nigel Gibbens, chief veterinary officer, advised it should be extended. This could be for eight weeks. Badger campaigners have called the scheme a "massive failure" and said they would continue their protest . Mr Gibbens said extending the cull would achieve the "earliest and greatest possible impact" on bovine TB in Gloucestershire. Defra said Natural England was currently considering the application to extend the licence in Gloucestershire and a decision is "expected shortly". Mr Paterson told the BBC the cull figures were "not bad news" but admitted that those carrying out the killings had "got off to a slower start" in Gloucestershire. "We must remember that these are pilots," he said. "This has not been done before and we are learning, clearly, in each area. This isn't a sudden six-week period. These pilots are intended to go on for four years. "Up to to the end of July, a further 20,000 perfectly healthy cattle have been hauled off to slaughter at horrendous expense to the taxpayer because we've lost control of TB." Mr Paterson said 305,000 cattle had been "lost" over the past 10 years and it was "not acceptable" to allow the disease to go on. The badger cull in Gloucestershire ended this week. A licence was granted last week to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November. Defra said early indications from Gloucestershire are that, as in Somerset, the pilot had been "safe and humane". The government's original target was 2,900 badgers, based on a population estimate of 3,400 animals. The target was then revised to 1,650, from a population of 2,350. Last week Mr Paterson said the government was exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB. Stop the Badger Cull spokesman Jay Tiernan said the cull had been a "massive failure". "It's disgraceful," he said. "It clearly isn't safe, effective or humane. "It is time for someone to bite the bullet and admit it's been a failure." Mr Tiernan said protests against the culls would continue. </body>

      <title>Osborne agrees to China nuclear deal</title>
      <description>The Chancellor, George Osborne, announces that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.</description>

      <body>The Chancellor, George Osborne, has announced that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. The announcement also said that Chinese firms might eventually be allowed to take majority stakes in British nuclear plants. Mr Osborne made the announcement on the last day of a trade visit to China. The first China deal could be as early as next week, with the go ahead for a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site. Also on Thursday, a report commissioned for the prime minister warned of a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years. The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits". Supply is expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15. Most existing coal-fired plants are expected to be closed in 2015 to meet European Union pollution directives, while many gas-fired power plants are not being used at the moment because gas is so expensive. These would take time and money to bring back on stream. The Hinkley C project, in Somerset, will be the first new nuclear power station since 1995. Hinkley C's construction will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EDF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs. EDF has been negotiating with three Chinese nuclear giants on the Hinkley C project - CGN, CNNC and SNPTC - all of which have been seen by the chancellor this week. Our business editor, Robert Peston, says he has been told that one or two of these will end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C. A DECC spokesperson said talks about a contract were underway: "Negotiations remain ongoing between the government and EDF on the potential terms of an investment contract for Hinkley Point C. No agreement has as yet been reached. "A contract will only be offered if it is value for money, fair and affordable, in line with government policy on no public subsidy for new nuclear and consistent with state-aid rules." Mr Osborne made the announcement while on a visit to the Taishan nuclear plant in southern China on Thursday which is itself a collaboration between EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG). He said: "Today is another demonstration of the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China, the world's oldest civil nuclear power and the world's fastest growing civil nuclear power." The memorandum of understanding also includes roles for British companies in China's nuclear programme. China has 17 nuclear reactors in operation, which provide about 1% of its electricity production capacity. In the future, Chinese firms might be allowed more than just minority stakes in UK plants. The government said that "over time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes". At the weekend, the Energy Minister, Ed Davey, said he believed that a "massive" wave of investment from China, Japan and Korea would secure UK's power supply into the future. Securing future energy supplies is a major challenge. A portion of energy bills is being diverted to alternative energy investment in wind farms and solar energy. But the government believes that renewable energy sources cannot provide enough power for the country's energy needs. The industry regulator, Ofgem, has also warned of the "unprecedented challenge" to secure power supplies. It said spare electricity power production capacity could fall to 2% by 2015, increasing the risk of blackouts. </body>

      <title>Clawed fossil had spider-like brain</title>
      <description>A clawed spider-like creature reveals the most intact nervous system ever observed in an ancient fossil, 520 million years old.</description>

      <body>Scientists have discovered the best-preserved nervous system in an ancient fossil. Dating back 520 million years, the clawed spider-like fossil shows clear evidence of a brain and of nerve cords running through the creature's trunk. The specimen now confirms that the ancestors of spiders and scorpions were related, but branched off more than half-a-billion years ago. A team of international scientists present their work in Nature. The "great appendage" arthropods, are an extinct group of joint-legged creatures with large claw-like appendages - or growths - protruding from their heads. The nervous system tends to be similar between major groups of animals, which helps palaeontologists work out how they are related, explained Greg Edgecombe from the Natural History Museum in London. "The nervous system is one of the more reliable tool-kits we have. We were trying to investigate whether there was evidence for the preservation of neural tissues from very early parts of the animal fossil record," he told BBC News. "What we've been working with is fossils with very fine anatomical preservation from the Cambrian period. These have given us information about brains, the nerve cords and the neural tissue that goes into the eyes." New to science, the fossil was recently discovered in South China and is part of the genus Alalcomenaeus. This group had segmented bodies equipped with about a dozen pairs of appendages which enabled the creatures to swim or crawl. It was placed in a CT scanner and compared with other arthropods in order to understand its evolution. The team then used 3D software to see structures not visible on the surface of the fossil. "People like myself who are mad keen on creepy crawlies want to understand how very strange early arthropods relate to living ones," added Dr Edgecombe. "By having access to the nervous system it allows us to study the evolutionary relationships of very ancient fossils using the same kind of information that we would use for living animals." Co-author, Xiaoya Ma, also from the Natural History Museum, said: "It is very exciting to use new techniques to successfully reveal such a complete central nervous system from a 520-million-year old fossil, and in such detail." She told the BBC's Science in Action programme that the high resolution of the reconstructed image allowed the team to see "the concentrated neural structures in the head region". They could also observe the segments of the brain associated with the claw-like appendages. The fossil belongs to an extinct group of marine arthropods known as megacheirans, Greek for "large claws". To infer the evolutionary relationships between species, the fields of palaeontology and neuroanatomy together. Nicholas Strausfeld was from the anatomy side of the team at the University of Arizona, US. "We now know that the megacheirans had central nervous systems very similar to today's horseshoe crabs and scorpions," said Prof Strausfeld. "This means the ancestors of spiders and their kin lived side by side with the ancestors of crustaceans in the Lower Cambrian." He added that their prominent appendages were clearly used for grasping and holding. "Based on their location, we can now say that the biting mouthparts in spiders and their relatives evolved from these appendages." The team says they expect to find more fossils dating even further back, which will shed new light onto the ancestors of many of today's arthropods. </body>

      <title>Push for 'smaller' Antarctic reserve</title>
      <description>The EU and US lead a new call for the creation of a scaled down marine protection zone in the Southern Ocean.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24551855</url>

      <body>A bloc of countries has issued a joint call for the creation of marine reserves in Antarctica. The group, which includes the US, EU, France, New Zealand and Australia, saw their initial plans thrown out by opposition from Russia earlier this year. But the new plan suggests significant scaling down of one reserve in the hope of securing agreement. It will be submitted to a meeting in Tasmania next week. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), made up of 25 members with interests in the Southern Ocean, has been working since 2005 to establish marine protected areas (MPAs) in the region. At a special meeting in July, plans to establish two giant reserves in the Ross Sea and in east Antarctica were tabled by a number of countries. The Ross Sea proposal, supported by the US and New Zealand, would have banned commercial fishing in an area of 1.6m sq km. The other reserve, supported by France, Australia and the EU aimed to protect 1.9m sq km on the Pacific side of Antarctica. But Russia and the Ukraine questioned the legal basis of the plan that would have more than doubled the size of the world's marine reserves at a stroke. Other countries, including Norway, China and Japan queried the science and the size of the proposed reserves and wanted the inclusion of a "sunset clause", which meant the decision could be reviewed in the future. As CCAMLR operates on a consensus basis, the nations in favour of the plans were forced to withdraw. Now ahead of the Commission's annual meeting in Hobart, the proponents of the reserves have issued revised plans and a call for their adoption. Last month New Zealand and the US published details of a new Ross Sea plan. It cut the size of the reserve by 40% and left a question over the permanence of the arrangement. While the proposal for east Antarctica was also revised, it remains essentially the same in terms of the area covered. "The original bigger Ross Sea plan is now off the table," Paulus Tak from the Pew Charitable Trust told BBC News. "It is now for a smaller area than was originally proposed. They are making the concessions to get the opponents onboard. "Whether that will be a useful move for Russia and the Ukraine who put forward legal objections, remains to be seen." In today's statement, the foreign ministers call on all members of the Commission to support the plans, saying that these regions are "widely recognised for their remarkable ecological and scientific importance". They argue that the proposals before the Commission are based on "sound and best available science and will provide a unique laboratory for marine research, and will have profound and lasting benefits for ocean conservation." However environmental campaigners like Paulus Tak are concerned that the proponents of the MPAs will make further concessions during the meeting. "We call upon the states to maintain the ambition level, and as such each downgrading of the proposal is a matter of some concern from our side, but we want to see a successful outcome of these negotiations." Another issue that could hold up the MPA proposal is the US government shutdown, which could prevent the American delegation from attending. If that happens, the discussion on protecting the Antarctic could be held off for another year. Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <body>Divers working at a Russian lake have recovered a half-tonne chunk of the space rock that exploded over Chelyabinsk earlier this year. The object plunged into Lake Chebarkul in central Russia on 15 February, leaving a 6m-wide hole in the ice. Scientists say that it is the largest fragment of the meteorite yet found. More than 1,000 people were injured when a 17m, 10,000-tonne space rock burned up over Central Russia, breaking windows and rocking buildings. Live footage showed a team pull out a 1.5-metre-long (five-foot-long) rock from the lake after first wrapping it in a special covering and placing it on a metal sheet while it was still underwater. The rock broke into three parts as it was pulled from the depths. Once ashore, it was placed on top of a scale for weighing. However, the scale broke as it hit the 570kg (1,255lb) mark. Dr Caroline Smith, curator of meteorites at London's Natural History Museum, confirmed that the object was a meteorite from characteristic features known as fusion crust and regmaglypts, which are obvious in images. She told BBC News: "Fusion crust forms as the meteoroid is travelling through the atmosphere as a fireball. "The outer surface gets so hot it melts the rock to form a dark, glassy surface crust which we term a fusion crust. Regmaglypts are the indentations, that look a bit like thumbprints, also seen on the surface of the meteorite." Sergey Zamozdra, an associate professor at Chelyabinsk State University, told the Interfax news agency: "The preliminary examination... shows that this is really a fraction of the Chelyabinsk meteorite. "This chunk is most probably one of the top 10 biggest meteorite fragments ever found." The divers' mission had been hampered by a number of factors. The rock fragment lay at 13m depth, not 6m or 8m as was originally thought. The Vesti 24 rolling news channel reported that divers had already recovered more than 12 pieces from Lake Chebarkul since the incident on 15 February. The station said that only four or five of them had turned out to be real meteorites. </body>

      <title>Bee-friendly plants put to the test</title>
      <description>An experimental garden has revealed that the right plants can attract up to 100 times more pollinators, say scientists.</description>

      <body>Researchers have used an experimental garden to put pollinator-friendly plants to the test. The University of Sussex scientists counted the number of insects visiting the plants in their garden. They say their findings show that insect-friendly plants are just as pretty, cheap and easy to grow as less pollinator-friendly varieties. Their results are published in the Journal of Functional Ecology. PhD student Mihail Garbuzov used 32 different varieties of popular garden plants. These included some nectar-rich and highly scented plants he thought would be attractive to insects and some that seemed to be less attractive. While the small-scale study did not produce an exhaustive list of the best plants for pollinating insects, the team says the data has put a number on just how many more pollinators the right plants can attract. Mr Garbuzov told the BBC: "Some of the best plants attracted approximately 100 times as many insects as the worst. "And the plants that are attractive to insects are not more expensive, and they're just as pretty." The researchers wrote in their paper that there was "great scope for making gardens and parks more insect friendly" by selecting the right plants. Tips for insect-friendly gardening are already available from a variety of sources, but the researchers say they are largely based on "opinion and general experience". The aim of this study, said Prof Francis Ratnieks, from the University of Sussex, was to "put that advice on a firmer scientific footing, by gathering information about the actual number of insects visiting the flowers to collect nectar or pollen". The researchers gathered their data simply by visiting each of the patches of flowers every day over two summers and counting the number of insects on the flowers. Their results did lead them to make some horticultural recommendations - they found that borage, lavender, marjoram and open-flower dahlias varieties were very good for insects. The colourfully named bowles mauve everlasting wallflower was also very attractive to pollinators, while the least attractive flowering plant for insects was the very popular geranium. Marjoram, the researchers say, was probably the best "all-rounder", attracting honey bees, bumble bees, other bees, hover flies, and butterflies. Borage was the best for honey bees and lavender and open-flowered dahlias were most attractive to bumblebees. The team put a number of varieties of lavender to the test and found that highly bred hybrids, including some with novel colours - such as white or pink - that have been carefully bred into the plants proved the most attractive to insects. Dr Nigel Raine, from Royal Holloway University of London, commented that with bee populations declining across the world, "we can all give bees a helping hand by planting the right flowers to give them the nectar and pollen they need". "This study highlights that it's important for bee-friendly gardeners to choose what you plant with care," he added. "Gardeners and town planners should think carefully about the mixture of flowers they plant to ensure food is available for a wide range of bees and other important insect pollinators. "It's also important to cater for the needs of the rarer species and provide food at times when there might be fewer wild flowers in bloom." </body>

      <body>Elephants have a mysterious and "tangible energy" according to South African photographer Greg Du Toit. Now after a 10 year quest, his portrayal of this "energy" has been captured in an award-winning photo. Titled "Essence of Elephants", the work has earned him the overall title in this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition. Preparation and passion, he says, were key to achieving the winning shot, taken from just over one metre away. "There was one particular day when a baby elephant raced past right in front of my camera and I was ready. I had to be prepared for that moment," said Mr Du Toit. He took the picture at a waterhole in Botswana's Northern Tuli Game Reserve from a hide (a sunken freight container) that provided a ground-level view. He had been going to the area five or six times a year for 10 years. "I chose elephants because I feel a very special energy and connection when I'm around them," he told BBC News. "But although you feel that energy it's very difficult to translate that into a camera because an elephant is such a big animal and they're not very charismatic, whereas a predator is far more charismatic." Using a very slow shutter speed on a wide angle lens "allowed all that energy to come into my camera" making him able to depict "these gentle giants in an almost ghostly way". To achieve the cool blue hue he attached a polarising filter and set his white balance to a cool temperature. The Wildlife Photographer of the Year (WPY) "means a lot to me for various reasons", said Du Toit, especially because photos were submitted anonymously, putting professionals and amateurs on an equal footing. "In my mind it's one of the last places in the world you can actually look at a wildlife photo and trust that the moment is authentic." Chair of the judging panel Jim Brandenburg said: "Greg's image immediately catapults us to African plains. This image stood out for both its technical excellence and the unique moment it captures - it is truly a once in a lifetime shot." This year's Young Wildlife Photographer of the year is 14-year-old Udayan Rao Pawar from India. His photo was of a fresh water crocodile with hatchlings on its head "kind of resembling a crown", explained Mr Pawar. He crept up on the nestling colony of gharials on the banks of the Chambal River, "When the dawn broke early in the morning I hid myself behind a rock, and when the morning light came I took those images. "I could hear them making little grunting sounds. Very soon a large female surfaced near the shore, checking on her charges. Some of the hatchlings swam to her and climbed onto her head. Perhaps it made them feel safe." Despite conservation efforts, the gharial fresh water crocodile is on the verge of extinction with an estimated 200 mating pairs remaining. "The Chambal River is the gharial's last stronghold but is threatened by illegal sand-mining and fishing", added Udayan. Wildlife photographer and Judge Tui De Roy said the composition and timing of the photograph was perfect. "The mother's gaze seems directed at you, appealing to you to let her live and thrive in peace. This image is beautiful and thought provoking, but at the same time also wonderfully playful, making it a clear winner," he said. WPY is one of the most prestigious competitions in world photography. Organised by London's Natural History Museum and BBC Wildlife Magazine, it is now in its 49th year. Images are submitted anonymously by professional and amateur photographers alike. They are selected for their creativity, artistry and technical complexity and must be submitted as a raw file with no manipulations. The winners beat 43,000 entries submitted from 96 countries.

      <title>3D printing 'entering the metal age'</title>

      <body>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion projects. The Amaze project brings together 28 institutions to develop new metal components which are lighter, stronger and cheaper than conventional parts. Additive manufacturing (or "3D printing") has already revolutionised the design of plastic products. Printing metal parts for rockets and planes would cut waste and save money. The layered method of assembly also allows intricate designs - geometries which are impossible to achieve with conventional metal casting. Parts for cars and satellites can be optimised to be lighter and - simultaneously - incredibly robust. Tungsten alloy components that can withstand temperatures of 3,000C were unveiled at Amaze's launch on Tuesday at London's Science Museum. At such extreme temperatures they can survive inside nuclear fusion reactors and on the nozzles of rockets. "We want to build the best quality metal products ever made. Objects you can't possibly manufacture any other way," said David Jarvis, Esa's head of new materials and energy research. "To build a [fusion reactor], like Iter, you somehow have to take the heat of the Sun and put it in a metal box. "3,000C is as hot as you can imagine for engineering. "If we can get 3D metal printing to work, we are well on the way to commercial nuclear fusion." Additive manufacturing with metal is not new; General Electric, for example, has used the technique to make fuel injectors for one of its aircraft engines. China claims to be using 3D printing to manufacture load-bearing components in aircraft. And in July, Nasa announced that it had successfully tested a 3D-printed rocket engine part. Amaze is a loose acronym for Additive Manufacturing Aiming Towards Zero Waste and Efficient Production of High-Tech Metal Products. The 20m-euro project brings together 28 partners from European industry and academia - including Airbus, Astrium, Norsk Titanium, Cranfield University, EADS, and the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. Factory sites are being set up in France, Germany, Italy, Norway and the UK to develop the industrial supply chain. Amaze researchers have already begun printing metal jet engine parts and aeroplane wing sections up to 2m in size. These high-strength components are typically built from expensive, exotic metals such as titanium, tantalum and vanadium. Using traditional techniques to fashion metal objects often wastes precious raw material. Whereas additive manufacturing - building parts up layer-on-layer from 3D digital data - has the potential to produce almost "zero waste". "To produce one kilo of metal, you use one kilo of metal - not 20 kilos," says Esa's Franco Ongaro. "We need to clean up our act - the space industry needs to be more green. And this technique will help us." Printing objects as a single piece - without welding or bolting - can make them both stronger and lighter. A weight reduction of even 1kg for a long-range aircraft will save hundreds of thousands of dollars over its lifespan. "Our ultimate aim is to print a satellite in a single piece. One chunk of metal, that doesn't need to be welded or bolted," said Jarvis. "To do that would save 50% of the costs - millions of euros." But Jarvis is candid about the problems and inefficiencies that still need to be overcome - what he calls the "dirty secrets" of 3D printing. "One common problem is porosity - small air bubbles in the product. Rough surface finishing is an issue too," he said. "We need to understand these defects and eliminate them - if we want to achieve industrial quality. "And we need to make the process repeatable - scale it up. "We can't do all this unless we collaborate between industries - space, fusion, aeronautics. "We need all these teams working together and sharing." </body>

      <body>Prof Peter Higgs, the joint winner of this year's Nobel Prize for Physics, has promised to retire - once he turns 85. In a BBC Scotland interview, he also revealed that he turned down the offer of a knighthood because he did not want "that sort of title". Prof Higgs said he feels uncomfortable being likened to other Nobel winners. The 84-year-old said this was because his work on the particle which carries his name only took a very short time. He said: "I'm getting the prize for something which took me two or three weeks in 1964. It's a very small amount of my life. "If you take Einstein for the example, his achievements were several orders of magnitude greater." Prof Higgs was born in Newcastle, but developed his theory while working at the University of Edinburgh. His landmark research defined what was to become known as the Higgs boson. Discovering the particle became one of the most sought-after goals in science, and the team of scientists from the European nuclear research facility Cern, who were behind the $10bn Large Hadron Collider (LHC), made proving its existence a key priority. In July 2012, physicists at Cern confirmed the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson. Prof Higgs said he was offered a knighthood in 1999 by Prime Minister Tony Blair but refused the honour. "I thought anything of that sort was premature," he explained, "and anyway, I didn't want that sort of title thank you." "As you know I've recently become a Companion of Honour but that's rather discreet. It's a couple of letters after your name." The physicist retired from full-time teaching 17 years ago but has remained active in sharing his knowledge with other scientists. He now intends to retire "properly" after his 85th birthday. "I'm proposing to retire at the age of 85, next year," he confirmed. "But flying around the world giving lectures is a fairly recent phenomenon because of the build up to this discovery at Cern." </body>

      <title>Apes comfort each other 'like humans'</title>
      <description>Observations of young bonobos reveal that, like children, those more able to manage their own emotions are more likely to comfort others.</description>

      <body>Young bonobos that are more "socially competent" are more likely to cuddle and calm other apes that are in distress, research has revealed. Scientists working at an African sanctuary found that bonobos that recovered quickly from an upsetting experience, such as a fight, were also more likely to comfort others. This mirrors findings from studies in children, and suggests bonobos manage their emotions in a very similar way. The work is published in PNAS journal. The researchers captured footage showing "emotionally competent" young apes rushing to hug other juveniles that were screaming after being attacked. Bonobos are already known as the "empathic apes". Previous studies have documented their responses to others' emotions. Prof Frans de Waal from Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University in Atlanta, said these new results revealed that their ability to console one another was part of this empathy. He added: "It's almost as if one first needs to have one's own emotional house in order before one is ready to visit the emotional house of another. "This is true for children, and apparently also for bonobos." Prof de Waal's colleague and the lead researcher who gathered footage of these ape interactions was Dr Zanna Clay, also from Emory University. She explained that the sanctuary, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, provided a natural setting to study emotional behaviour, because the rescued orphan bonobos there behaved very differently from the apes that had been raised by their mothers. The Olola ya Bonoboo sanctuary is home to many bonobo victims of bushmeat hunting; apes that were taken from their mothers at an early age by hunters. These youngsters are cared for by humans and, after several years of this rehabilitation, they are transferred into a forested enclosure to join a group of bonobos. Watching the bonobos, Dr Clay found that rehabilitated orphans had much more difficulty managing their emotions. After a fight, Dr Clay explained, these orphan apes "would be very upset, screaming for minutes". "Mother-reared juveniles would recover and snap out of it in seconds," she added. The findings, the researchers say, indicate that "the way we develop our social and emotional skills and how we deal with the emotional world around us may be shared with that of our closest ape relatives". Richard Byrne is professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of St Andrews. He pointed out that the term "consolation" implies that we know about the emotion of the apes and their reasons for intervening, which, he said, "is not part of the observed data". "But they are our closest relatives, so personally I would argue that the best guess of their emotions is that they'd be the same as our own in a similar situation." </body>

      <title>'Diamond rain' on Saturn and Jupiter</title>
      <description>Diamonds as big as jewels fall as "rain" on Saturn and Jupiter, seeded by giant lightning storms, according to new calculations by US scientists.</description>

      <body>Diamonds big enough to be worn by Hollywood film stars could be raining down on Saturn and Jupiter, US scientists have calculated. New atmospheric data for the gas giants indicates that carbon is abundant in its dazzling crystal form, they say. Lightning storms turn methane into soot (carbon) which as it falls hardens into chunks of graphite and then diamond. These diamond "hail stones" eventually melt into a liquid sea in the planets' hot cores, they told a conference. The biggest diamonds would likely be about a centimetre in diameter - "big enough to put on a ring, although of course they would be uncut," says Dr Kevin Baines, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He added they would be of a size that the late film actress Elizabeth Taylor would have been "proud to wear". "The bottom line is that 1,000 tonnes of diamonds a year are being created on Saturn. "People ask me - how can you really tell? Because there's no way you can go and observe it. "It all boils down to the chemistry. And we think we're pretty certain." Baines presented his unpublished findings at the annual meeting of the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society in Denver, Colorado, alongside his co-author Mona Delitsky, from California Speciality Engineering. Uranus and Neptune have long been thought to harbour gemstones. But Saturn and Jupiter were not thought to have suitable atmospheres. Baines and Delitsky analysed the latest temperature and pressure predictions for the planets' interiors, as well as new data on how carbon behaves in different conditions. They concluded that stable crystals of diamond will "hail down over a huge region" of Saturn in particular. "It all begins in the upper atmosphere, in the thunderstorm alleys, where lightning turns methane into soot," said Baines. "As the soot falls, the pressure on it increases. And after about 1,000 miles it turns to graphite - the sheet-like form of carbon you find in pencils." By a depth of 6,000km, these chunks of falling graphite toughen into diamonds - strong and unreactive. These continue to fall for another 30,000km - "about two-and-a-half Earth-spans" says Baines. "Once you get down to those extreme depths, the pressure and temperature is so hellish, there's no way the diamonds could remain solid. "It's very uncertain what happens to carbon down there." One possibility is that a "sea" of liquid carbon could form. "Diamonds aren't forever on Saturn and Jupiter. But they are on Uranus and Neptune, which are colder at their cores," says Baines. The findings are yet to be peer reviewed, but other planetary experts contacted by BBC News said the possibility of diamond rain "cannot be dismissed". "The idea that there is a depth range within the atmospheres of Jupiter and (even more so) Saturn within which carbon would be stable as diamond does seem sensible," says Prof Raymond Jeanloz, one of the team who first predicted diamonds on Uranus and Neptune. "And given the large sizes of these planets, the amount of carbon (therefore diamond) that may be present is hardly negligible." However Dr Nadine Nettelmann, of the University of California, Santa Cruz, said further work was needed to understand whether carbon can form diamonds in an atmosphere which is rich in hydrogen and helium - such as Saturn's. "Baines and Delitsky considered the data for pure carbon, instead of a carbon-hydrogen-helium mixture," she explained. "We cannot exclude the proposed scenario (diamond rain on Saturn and Jupiter) but we simply have no data on mixtures in the planets. So we do not know if diamond formation occurs at all." Meanwhile, an exoplanet that was believed to consist largely of diamond may not be so precious after all, according to new research. The so-called "diamond planet" 55 Cancri e orbits a star 40 light-years from our Solar System. A study in 2010 suggested it was a rocky world with a surface of graphite surrounding a thick layer of diamond, instead of water and granite like Earth. But new research to be published in the Astrophysical Journal, calls this conclusion in question, making it unlikely any space probe sent to sample the planet's innards would dig up anything sparkling. Carbon, the element diamonds are made of, now appears to be less abundant in relation to oxygen in the planet's host star - and by extension, perhaps the planet. "Based on what we know at this point, 55 Cancri e is more of a 'diamond in the rough'," said author Johanna Teske, of the University of Arizona. </body>

      <body>Scientists are asking for the public's help to track the spread of a greedy slug species threatening to eat its way through British gardens and crops. The Spanish slug was first reported in the UK in January by Dr Ian Bedford, head of entomology at the John Innes Centre, Norwich. It can survive many slug pellets, eats crops spared by native species and tolerate drier conditions. A red-brown colour, pale or rich, can identify a suspected Spanish slug. Scientists fear it could breed with our native species to form a hybrid. The Iberian invader, Arion vulgaris, can reproduce in greater numbers and has unappealing habits, including eating dead animals and excrement. During the winter, many disappeared underground or died but their eggs survived and the species may have returned in greater numbers. Scientists are asking people to look for the slugs under logs and plant pots in their gardens, and record and photograph their findings using a dedicated SlugWatch website. "We want photos and sightings from members of the public to help build a picture of how widespread the Spanish slug has become," said Dr Bedford. "The reports may also give us an idea of whether it is breeding with our native species to form a hybrid combining the worst of the Spanish slug with tolerance to frosts and cold from our own species." Keith Norman, technical director of farming company Velcourt, said farmers were using up their entire allowance of slug pellets early in the season, leaving no other means of control. "It is a disaster waiting to happen if the Spanish slug proliferates and establishes itself in the UK," said Mr Norman. "The Spanish slug causes more eating damage and cannot be controlled with existing measures." The Slugwatch website was designed by Rachel Ayers, 17, a sixth-former at at Notre Dame High School. Norwich. She also designed cards identifying different species of slug for use in schools. "We want people to survey their gardens, local areas and school grounds for slugs, or they can build a trap using instructions on the site," she said. "One of the most interesting parts of the project was learning about slugs and how to identify them," said Rachel. There are 30 native species in the UK, four of which are classed as pests: the netted or grey field slug, the garden slug, the keeled slug and the large black slug. Slugs play an important role in the ecosystem. They are natural composters, breaking down vegetation, and provide food for hedgehogs, toads and some garden birds. "We hope that as well as helping with research into the Spanish slug, people will learn a bit about the biology of these molluscs," said Dr Bedford. "You never know, we may even help inspire someone to become a malacologist in the future." </body>

      <body>Cancer costs countries in the European Union 126bn euro (£107bn) a year, according to the first EU-wide analysis of the economic impact of the disease. The charity Cancer Research UK said it was a "huge burden". The figures, published in the Lancet Oncology, included the cost of drugs and health care as well as earnings lost through sickness or families providing care. Lung cancer was the most costly form of the disease. The team from the University of Oxford and King's College London analysed data from each of the 27 nations in the EU in 2009. The showed the total cost was 126bn euro and of that 51bn (£43bn) euro was down to healthcare costs including doctors' time and drug costs. Lost productivity, because of work missed through sickness or dying young, cost 52bn (£44bn) euro while the cost to families of providing care was put at 23bn (£19.5bn) euro. Overall, richer countries, such as Germany and Luxembourg, spent more on cancer treatment per person than eastern European countries such as Bulgaria and Lithuania. Lung cancer accounted for more than a tenth of all cancer costs in Europe. The deadly cancer tends to affect people at an earlier age than other cancers so the lost productivity through early deaths is a major factor. However, the overall economic burden is behind the costs of dementia and cardiovascular disease. An EU-wide study, by the same research group, showed cardiovascular diseases, including high blood pressure and stroke, cost 169bn euro (£144bn) a year while dementia cost 189bn euro (£169bn) in just 15 countries in Western Europe. Dementia has very high costs associated with long-term care while cardiovascular diseases include such a wide range of conditions it affects many more people than cancer. One of the researchers, Dr Ramon Luengo-Fernandez, from the Health Economics Research Centre at the University of Oxford, said: "By estimating the economic burden of several diseases it will be possible to help allocate public research funding towards the diseases with the highest burden and highest expected returns for that investment." Prof Richard Sullivan, from King's College London, said: "It is vital that decision-makers across Europe use this information to identify and prioritise key areas. "More effective targeting of investment may prevent health care systems from reaching breaking point - a real danger given the increasing burden of cancer - and in some countries better allocation of funding could even improve survival rates." Sara Osborne, head of policy at Cancer Research UK, said: "The financial impact that cancer has on the economy across Europe due to people dying prematurely from the disease and time off work remains a huge burden. "This study reinforces why research is vital to improve our understanding of the causes of cancer - so that we lessen the impact of the disease and develop better ways to prevent and treat the illness. "We also need to understand why the UK's cancer mortality rates remain higher than many EU countries despite a similar spend on cancer care." </body>

      <title>Few children 'connected to nature'</title>
      <description>Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a three-year study from the RSPB suggests.</description>

      <body>Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a study from the RSPB suggests. The three-year project found that only 21% of children aged 8-12 were "connected to nature". Girls were much more likely than boys to be exposed to the great outdoors, while children in Wales had the lowest score across the UK. The RSPB says that a perception among some adults that nature is dangerous or dirty could be holding children back. There has been an increasing amount of research in recent years underlining the lack of contact and experience with nature among modern children. Some have argued that this is having a negative impact on their health, education and behaviour. In 2012, the National Trust published a report on the phenomenon of "nature deficit disorder", though it is not recognised as a medical condition. The RSPB says its new study is the first to quantify the scale of British children's exposure, or lack of it, to the natural world. They came up with a definition of what "connected to nature" actually means and then developed a questionnaire with 16 statements designed to assess the level of connection among children. Some 1,200 children from across the UK were asked to agree or disagree with these statements. Only 21% of children in the UK had a level of connection with wildlife and the natural world that the RSPB believes should be realistic and achievable for all youngsters. This "realistic and achievable" value is based on the average scores of children visiting RSPB sites or who are junior members of the organisation. One interesting finding was the gender difference. While 27% of girls were at or above the "realistic and achievable" target, only 16% of boys were at the same level. "We need to understand these differences," Sue Armstrong-Brown, head of conservation at the charity, told BBC News. "Whether boys and girls are scoring differently on different questions, are girls more empathetic to nature than boys for instance? We need to analyse the data to find that out." The report also highlighted significant regional differences. Only 13% of children in Wales achieved the basic level of exposure, compared with almost twice this number in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The average score for London was higher than the rest of England. Overall urban children had a slightly higher connection than those living in rural areas. According to Sue Armstrong-Brown, the attitudes of adults may be having a significant effect on children. "There is definitely an attitude out there, in some cases, that nature is not perceived as interesting or engaging. In some cases it is perceived as a dirty or unsafe thing, and that's an attitude that won't help a young person climb a tree." The RSPB hopes that its study will be taken up by government as one of the indicators on the state of children's wellbeing. Sue Armstrong-Brown believes that improving the natural connection for children is not only good for the youngsters, it is crucial for the future of nature conservation in this country. "If we can grow a generation of children that have a connection to nature and do feel a sense of oneness with it, we then have the force for the future that can save nature and stop us living in a world where nature is declining," she said.

      <title>Extreme weather 'keeps people poor'</title>
      <description>A new study says that extreme weather scenarios can counter efforts to reduce poverty for hundreds of millions of people.</description>

      <body>New research suggests that extreme weather events will keep people poor in many parts of the world. The authors argue that where disasters like drought are prevalent, they can be the most important cause of poverty. They say that up to 325 million people will be living in countries highly exposed to natural hazards by 2030. If aid is not used to reduce these risks, the progress made in fighting poverty could disappear. The report has been compiled by the Overseas Development Institute. It examines the relationship between disasters and poverty over the next 20 years, using population projections, climate models and estimations of how governments can cope with extreme events. The report suggests that up to a third of a billion people could be living in the 49 countries most exposed to the full range of natural hazards and climate extremes in 2030. In sub-Saharan Africa 118 million people in poverty will face extreme events. The big weather issues that will face most poor people are drought, extreme rainfall and flooding. An analysis of the data from rural Ethiopia and Andhra Pradesh in India suggests that where there is a strong risk of drought, then drought is also the single most important factor in keeping people poor, outstripping ill health or dowry payments. "We've often heard that ill health is the biggest cause for impoverishment," said Dr Tom Mitchell, the ODI's head of climate change. "But in the data, in drought prone areas, the biggest cause is the drought - in areas exposed to these hazards, they are the key causes of impoverishment." Developed countries haven't recognised the role that these extreme weather events have in keeping people poor, he says. The big problem is that, at present, money tends to flow in response to disasters, not to prevent them. Dr Mitchell says the recent Cyclone Phailin in India is a good example. "The very fact that it killed so few people means that the chances of raising big finance for recovery efforts are going to be pretty slim. It has not got the big numbers attached to it," he said. "I think there's a direct link between the ability to raise finance and the number of people killed. It's a perverse incentive." Part of the problem is that donor countries are not prioritising aid at the countries that need it most, in terms of disaster risk reduction. "We've tended to provide much more financial support to a set of middle income countries, who can manage it better like the Philippines, Mexico and Indonesia who made really great strides in protecting their populations," said Dr Mitchell. "What we've not done is focus on the poorest countries, the ones most exposed to issues like drought, for example, sub Saharan Africa, we've almost missed it off." The authors of the report argue that the way that vulnerable countries spend their money needs reforming too. Too often the money is spent on the capital city or on infrastructure and not on the poorest people. The report calls for the post-2015 development goals to include targets on disasters and climate change, to recognise the threat they pose to eradicating poverty by 2030. "If the international community are serious about ending extreme poverty they need to get serious about reducing disaster risk for the poorest people," said Dr Mitchell. "At the moment that's not happening, so the chance of ending extreme poverty is pie in the sky, it is just not going to work." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>Air pollution 'still harming health'</title>
      <description>Some pollutants continue to pose a "significant threat" to European citizens' health and the environment, says a report by the European Environment Agency.</description>

      <body>Air pollution is continuing to damage European citizens' health and the environment, latest figures show. The European Environment Agency (EEA) listed tiny airborne particles and ozone as posing a "significant threat". However, the authors said nations had significantly cut emissions of a number of pollutants, including sulphur dioxide, lead and carbon monoxide. In a separate study, research identified a link between low birth-weight and exposure to air pollution. EEA executive director Hans Bruyninckx said that EU nations had made considerable progress over recent decades to reduce the visible signs of air pollution, with cities now no longer shrouded in blankets of smog. However, he added: "Air pollution is causing damage to human health and ecosystems. Large parts of the population do not live in a healthy environment, according to current standards. "To get on to a sustainable path, Europe will have to be ambitious and go beyond current legislation." The EEA report showed that data suggested that up to 96% of the EU's urban population was exposed to fine particulate matter concentrations above UN World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Even more, 98%, were subject to ground-level ozone concentrations above WHO recommended levels. As well has urban outdoor air quality, the report also highlighted that the natural environment was also continuing to suffer. It said ecosystem were subject to the pressure of air pollution impairing vegetation growth and harming biodiversity." The EEA also produced country-by-country breakdown of air quality data. Responding to the report's findings, Environment Commissioner Janez Potocnik said: "Air quality is a central concern for many people. "Surveys show that a large majority of citizens understand well the impact of air quality on health and are asking public authorities to take action at EU, national and local levels." He added that he was willing to address those concerns in the Commission's Air Policy Review. Infant concerns A separate study, also published on Tuesday, concluded that a substantial proportion of the cases of low birth-weight (less than 2.5kg at 37 weeks of gestation) "could be prevented in Europe if urban air pollution was reduced". The findings, published in the The Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal, said: "The population attributable risk estimated for a reduction in [particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less] concentration to 10 micrograms per cubic metre during pregnancy corresponded to a decrease of 22% in cases of low birth-weight at term." A team of European researchers carried out what they describe as one of the largest studies of its kind, collating data from more than 74,000 births between 1994 and 2011 across 12 European nations. They explained that babies with low birth-weights were at greater risk of mortality and health problems than infants with higher birth-weights. "Low birth-weight has been associated with wheezing and asthma in childhood, and with decreased lung function in adults," they observed but added that there was inconsistency in the findings. "In addition to active and passive smoking, atmospheric pollution exposure is a highly prevalent and controllable risk factor for low birth-weight." Lead author Dr Marie Pedersen from the Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology in Barcelona, Spain, observed: "The widespread exposure of pregnant women worldwide to urban ambient air pollution at similar or even higher concentrations than those assessed in our study provides a clear message to policymakers to improve the quality of the air we all share." Current EU legislation has sent the annual mean limit on fine particulate matter at 20 micrograms per cubic metre for particles measuring 2.5 microns (PM2.5) or less. This is twice the concentration outlined in World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, which recommends an annual mean limit for PM2.5 exposure to 10 micrograms per cubic metre. These microscopic particles (the diameter of a human hair ranges between 15 and 180 microns) end up in the atmosphere from a range of sources, including road transport emissions, and have been linked to heart and lung disease, cancer and premature death. Prof Bruyninckx described the Lancet paper's findings as "very concerning", adding that despite progress being made in some areas, more action was needed to tackle air pollution. "It is the explicit goal of the European Commission to narrow that gap, and in the long run, close that gap because we are... concerned about citizens' health," he told BBC News. But he explained: "Before you make binding legislation, you want to be on absolutely solid ground scientifically. "Now, we know that [particulate matter] is having a significant impact so we need to adjust our rules and regulations accordingly." Commenting on the findings published in The Lancet, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists spokesman Dr Patrick O'Brien said the research was "very helpful in providing further evidence on the potential health impacts of air pollution". But he added: "Exposure to some level of air pollution is unavoidable in day-to-day life and the risk still remains fairly low. "Other factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure or excessive alcohol consumption, may contribute more to the risk of having a low birth weight baby." </body>

      <title>Germany delays CO2 limits for cars</title>
      <description>Germany persuades the EU to delay introducing new limits on CO2 emissions from cars - and angers environmentalists.</description>

      <body>The German government has persuaded its EU partners to delay introducing new limits on CO2 emissions from cars. Environment ministers agreed to revise a deal, reached in July, that set a limit of 95g per km for the average car. That target for CO2 emissions was to take effect in 2020. But Germany, famous for its high-performance cars, says the 95g limit should not take full effect until 2024. Green activists deplored the new delay as a "shameful sop" to polluters. A leading German Green Party MEP, Rebecca Harms, accused Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel of "riding roughshod" over the EU's democratic process, because the 2020 agreement had already been reached between the European Parliament and the Council - the EU ministerial grouping. "Weakening the agreed 2020 limits, which have long been known, is a shameful sop to German car manufacturers and will slow the development of new technologies to deliver more efficient and less polluting cars," Ms Harms said after the ministers' vote. Chancellor Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) are holding talks with the Greens on Tuesday on the possibilities of forming a coalition government. But many analysts believe a "grand" coalition between the CDU and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) is more likely to emerge. The UK was among the countries that supported the German environment minister's position on Monday, German ARD news reports. The German minister, Peter Altmaier, said "it's not a fight over principles but how we bind the necessary clarity in climate protection with the required flexibility and competitiveness to protect the car industry in Europe". Correspondents say there has been intense lobbying by luxury carmakers such as BMW and Daimler, maker of Mercedes, over the EU legislation. The emissions limits are part of the EU's drive to switch Europe to a low-carbon economy and slow the impact of climate change. There is also widespread concern about other pollutants from car exhausts. In a new report, the European Environment Agency (EEA) says more than 90% of European city dwellers are exposed to the most harmful particles in air pollution - PM and O3. Often the particles are transported for long distances across borders, it says. Under the German proposal, the 95g target for CO2 would be phased in - it would apply to 80% of cars by 2020, and then to all by 2024. The ministers' backing for Germany means a revised plan will now be negotiated with MEPs and the European Commission, and a deal may not be reached until after the May 2014 European elections. EU Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard said she was disappointed and rejected the German proposal, Reuters news agency reported. Critics say the delay will undermine investment in greener alternatives, like electric cars and more fuel-efficient engines. </body>

      <title>Warming makes El Nino 'more intense'</title>
      <description>New research says that the El Nino weather phenomenon will be more intense as a result of rising temperatures.</description>

      <body>Scientists say they are more certain than ever about the impact of global warming on a critical weather pattern. The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) occurs in the Pacific Ocean but plays an important part in the world's climate system. Researchers have until now been unsure as to how rising temperatures would affect ENSO in the future. But this new study suggests that droughts and floods driven by ENSO will be more intense. The ENSO phenomenon plays a complicated role in the global weather system. The El Nino part of the equation sees a warming of the eastern and tropical Pacific, while its cooler sister, La Nina, makes things chillier in these same regions. Like water in a bathtub, the warmer or cooler waters slosh back and forth across the Pacific Ocean. They are responsible for rainfall patterns across Australia and the equatorial region, but their effects are also felt much further away. During the Northern Hemisphere winter, for example, you can get more intense rainfall over the southern part of the US in a warmer El Nino phase. For years, scientists have been concerned about how this sensitive weather system might be changed by rising temperatures from global warming. Now, in this new paper, published in the journal Nature, researchers give their most "robust" projections yet. Using the latest generation of climate models, they found a consistent projection for the future of ENSO. According to the lead author, Dr Scott Power from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, global warming interferes with the way El Nino temperature patterns affect rainfall. "This interference causes an intensification of El Nino-driven drying in the western Pacific and rainfall increases in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific," he said. According to Dr Wenju Cai, a scientist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), who was not involved with the study, the paper is "significant". "Up until now, there has been a lack of agreement among computer models as to how ENSO will change in the future," he explained. "This paper is significant in that there is stronger agreement among different climate models in predicting the future impact. "This study finds that both wet and dry anomalies will be greater in future El Nino years. This means that ENSO-induced droughts and floods will be more intense in the future."

      <body>A major archaeological dig in Wiltshire has unearthed evidence of frogs legs being eaten in Britain, 8,000 years before France, it has been claimed. The team, which consists of Mesolithic period experts, also found other types of food including salmon and nuts. David Jacques, from the University of Buckingham, said people living there thousands of years ago were eating a "Heston Blumenthal-style menu". The team hopes to confirm Amesbury as the UK's oldest continuous settlement. The dig will run until 25 October. It is being filmed and made into a documentary by the BBC, Smithsonian, CBC and others to be screened at a later date. The project is being led by the University of Buckingham. Mr Jacques added: "This is significant for our understanding of the way people were living around 5,000 years before the building of Stonehenge and it begs the question - where are the frogs now?" The latest information is based on a report by fossil mammal specialist Simon Parfitt, of the Natural History Museum. He examined the discoveries from the dig which has resulted in 12,000 finds, including 650 animal bones, all from the Mesolithic era. Andy Rhind-Tutt, chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust and co-ordinator of the community involvement on the dig, said the studies at Amesbury could help explain why Stonehenge was created. "No one would have built Stonehenge without there being something unique and really special about the area," he said. "There must have been something significant here beforehand and Blick Mead, with its constant temperature spring sitting alongside the River Avon, may well be it. "I believe that as we uncover more about the site over the coming days and weeks, we will discover it to be the greatest, oldest and most significant Mesolithic home base ever found in Britain." He added: "Currently Thatcham - 40 miles from Amesbury - is proving to be the oldest continuous settlement in the UK with Amesbury 104 years younger. "By the end of this latest dig, I am sure the records will need to be altered." The site already boasts the biggest collection of flints and cooked animal bones in north west Europe. The term Mesolithic refers to specific groups of archaeological cultures defined as falling between the Palaeolithic and the Neolithic periods. </body>

      <title>Edinburgh panda 'no longer pregnant'</title>
      <description>Edinburgh Zoo says its female giant panda, Tian Tian, is no longer expecting a cub.</description>

      <body>Edinburgh Zoo's female giant panda, Tian Tian, is no longer expecting a cub, it has been announced. Experts said her hormone and behavioural signs indicated that she had conceived and carried a foetus until late term, but then lost it. Tian Tian was artificially inseminated in April and had been showing signs of pregnancy for several weeks. However, the zoo said she had now returned to the eating and behavioural patterns of a non-pregnant panda. Chris West, chief executive officer for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said: "Such a loss has always been in our minds as a very real possibility, as it occurs in giant pandas as well as many other animals, including humans. "Our dedicated team of keepers, veterinary staff and many others worked tirelessly to ensure Tian Tian received the best care possible, which included remote observation and closing the panda enclosure to visitors to give her quiet and privacy. "We are conducting a detailed review of the scientific data collected, but I am totally confident that we did everything it was possible to do." The panda enclosure will remain closed until the end of the week to give Tian Tian time to get back into her routine and to give her keepers a chance to recuperate. Keepers insist Tian Tian received the best care possible and remain confident she will eventually give birth. Mr West added: "The majority of research centres and zoos with giant pandas around the world have not successfully bred until the third or fourth year. "What we have achieved, considering we have had giant pandas for less than two years, is immense. "New hormone research is beginning to indicate that lost pregnancies are more common in giant pandas than first thought, though at the moment no-one knows why." The zoo is renting Tian Tian and male panda Yang Guang from China for around £600,000 a year, hoping a cub or cubs would bring in more visitors. Some experts believe money spent on captive breeding would be better used to preserve the habitat of wild pandas. </body>

      <title>Meerkats 'pay rent' to top female</title>
      <description>Some subordinate female meerkats wet-nurse a dominant female's offspring in exchange for not being evicted from the group, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>Some subordinate female meerkats wet-nurse a dominant female's offspring in exchange for not being evicted from the group, a study suggests. Researchers found that females were more likely to do this if they had recently lost pups or had returned to the group following eviction. A group's dominant female aggressively suppresses other females from breeding through infanticide or eviction. The findings have been published in the Animal Behaviour journal. "When dominant females are pregnant, in the last few weeks of the pregnancy they usually throw out the top level of subordinate females," explained co-author Kirsty Macleod, a zoologist at the University of Cambridge. "That can be four or five subordinate females that are really strongly aggressed. "This is because if a female is pregnant herself, she is more likely to kill the pups of another pregnant female in an attempt to try and secure care for her own pups. "In the past, we thought that this behaviour was to try and stop the (dominant female's) pups being killed," Ms Macleod told BBC News that it was much more beneficial for females to belong to a group. "If they are on their own then they have a much more higher likelihood of being predated," she said. "In many cases, these females are evicted and we never see them again, so returning to the group is really crucial to their survival. "What we do see in the wild when they do return to the group is this extreme grovelling behaviour, so we can see that they are quite obviously trying to appease the dominant female. When they start lactating, this seems to fit with that behaviour [pattern]." Damp nipples The idea of subordinate females "paying rent" was based on data gathered from research carried out between 1996 and 2011, during which time scientists observed the behaviour of 40 groups of meerkats. Because most wet-nursing occurred underground in a group's burrows, females were identified as producing milk through the presence of suckle marks and sand being stuck to damp nipples. "Just the sheer volume of data available to me meant that I could look at a lot of different things and fairly definitively make these assumptions, even if it is just short of saying that this is definitely what is happening," Ms Macleod explained. The meerkats in the study are part of a long-term project headed by the University of Cambridge and Professor Tim Clutton-Brock, who is a co-author on the paper. The project, carried out in the Kalahari region of South Africa, also featured in the TV natural history series, Meerkat Manor and a Natural World documentary, to be broadcast on BBC2 (except Scotland) at 2100 UK time. "Wet-nursing by formerly evicted meerkats may be a way of 'paying rent' to be allowed back into the group without receiving further aggression," Ms Macleod observed. She added that researchers had long known about this "allolactation" behaviour among meerkats, with it occurring in almost half of the litters. But, she observed: "In a number of cases, it looks as if they are doing it when they are not pregnant themselves. Physiologically speaking, that is quite a big jump in terms of co-operative behaviour." The University of Cambridge researcher explained that wet-nursing was just one of a suite of co-operative behaviours that subordinate meerkats do. "More common behaviour includes feeding the pups when they are a little older, such as catching a scorpion or other invertebrates and passing it on. "They also babysit as well, so when the pups are very small a subordinate female will stay at the burrow for the entire day, meaning that [the adult is] losing all the benefits of foraging for that day." Ms Macleod said that she planned to carry out further research as part of her PhD research: "What I would like to look at in order to nail this (rent) idea down is whether the females that come back and start lactating are subject to less aggression. "Basically, being a subordinate female meerkat is quite a rough deal because you are in a group and you are caring for another females' young. "Then, if you try to have your own young, you are chased out of the group or your pups get eaten. "So there is this constant and very complex trade-off between the costs of trying to leave the group and have your own offspring against the benefits are being in the group." </body>

It was considered a success - harnessing the power of the laptop and mobile phone to help scientists crunch vast sets of data and sort and classify distant galaxies. Since then, there has been a huge surge of public participation in "citizen science" projects - from counting birds in gardens, to spotting exo-planets in the data sent back from the Kepler space telescope.

Scientists working at an African sanctuary found that bonobos that recovered quickly from an upsetting experience, such as a fight, were also more likely to comfort others. This mirrors findings from psychological studies in children, and suggests bonobos manage their emotions in a very similar way. It is published in the journal PNAS. Among their hours of footage, the researchers captured this clip showing one of the "emotionally competent" young apes rushing to hug another juvenile that had just been attacked. </body>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <title>China: Opportunity and risk for hi-tech firms</title>
      <description>China a land of opportunity and risk for hi-tech companies</description>

      <body>The UK Chancellor George Osborne said this morning that Britain tends to view China as a "sweatshop on the Pearl River". In reality, he told the Today programme, "it's at the forefront of medicine and hi-tech and computing". An official tweeted a picture of him, headphones on, gazing out at the grey urban landscape of Beijing. To coincide with his visit - and that of science minister David Willetts - a new report calls for China to be seen as a land of scientific opportunity not a black hole of intellectual theft and cybercrime. The study is by Nesta, a think tank founded to promote innovation, and it argues that the massive and growing scale of Chinese science means it is simply "too big to ignore"- spending about $500m on research every day and employing a quarter of the world's RandD workforce. A graphic image of a vast frenzy of research comes from a corporate adviser quoted as describing China as a "boiling cauldron of people just trying stuff". The headline facts are certainly impressive: One key factor identified in the report is the extraordinary size of spending on RandD - about $163bn last year, an amazing 18% increase on the previous year with further rises planned, with science seen as a central element of China's long-term strategy for growth. Measured by the number of patents applied for and secured, China is booming. By 2020, it could be producing more graduates than the US and EU combined. And by the same year, it may be publishing more scientific papers than the US. But of course quantity does not mean quality. The study also notes a recent estimate that only 10% of Chinese engineering graduates meet international standards of employability. So is China really a world leader in science or still a sweatshop? Or a bit of both? The answer is complicated, according to the report. The image of China as a science superpower may be accurate but it is only one of several different ways to view the country: The authors themselves argue that China should be seen as "an absorptive state", assimilating foreign technologies but then adding value and novelty to them. But what about the risks? The report acknowledges a darker side - the fears among hi-tech companies about the theft of their intellectual property. One business leader said "we don't feel ready yet to develop our 'crown jewels' IP in China". But he nevertheless supports long-term engagement there. A related threat is cybercrime - estimated, in a study for the Cabinet Office, to cost the UK £27bn a year. But the authors suggest the dangers may be overplayed, and may be of more concern to politicians than business people. Overall, the report concludes, "the greatest risk for companies is of focusing too much on these downsides, and missing out on the enormous opportunities that China presents", and it calls for far closer collaboration. People who've tried partnerships and have had their ideas or technology stolen may regard that perspective as overly rosy. But a new kind of science gold rush is under way in China - and, as in every rush, there are fortunes to be made, and lost. </body>

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>Can too much rumination be dangerous?</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <description>Why Chinese power giants are getting stake in UK's nuclear</description>

      <body>Part of what has been holding back the development of new nuclear power plants in the UK is their enormous cost. The government is refusing to finance these hugely pricey projects directly - although it will allow the owners of any new nuclear generators to charge well above the current market price for any power they produce in years and decades to come, so that the billions in development and construction costs can be recouped. The big attraction for the chancellor of allowing Chinese companies to invest in Britain's nuclear industry is that they have deep pockets. On his current trip to China, he has told the biggest Chinese nuclear companies they will in future even be able to own controlling stakes in British power stations, and not just small minority shares. When you think about the history of nuclear power, it may be shocking to some that businesses and investors from Britain - whose scientists and engineers were pioneers in this technology in the early days - will not own the new generation of nuclear power plants, and they may instead belong to China's nuclear power giants (as well as to the French and Japanese). The first of these deals with Chinese interests is expected to come next week, when the formal go ahead is expected for the construction of a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site in Somerset. This project will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EdF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs. I am told that EdF has been negotiating with three nuclear giants, CGN, CNNC and SNPTC. One or two of these is likely to end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C. George Osborne has met the bosses of all three of these companies, to give them comfort that he is keen for them to invest in British nuclear in general, and in Hinkley C in particular. Hinkley C's technology will be French, that of Areva. And the capital, the money, will be French, and - it now turns out - probably Chinese too. </body>

      <description>How much better is standing up than sitting?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24532996</url>

      <body>Studies have claimed major health benefits for standing for much of the day as opposed to sitting. The difference is marked, explains Michael Mosley. Guess how many hours a day you spend sitting? Fewer than eight? More than 10? A recent survey found that many of us spend up to 12 hours a day sitting on our bottoms looking at computers or watching television. If you throw in the seven hours we spend sleeping then that adds up to a remarkable 19 hours a day being sedentary. Sitting down as much as this is clearly bad for us and some studies suggest that those who sit all day live around two years less than those who are more active. Most of us are guilty of excess sitting. We sit at work, in the car and at home, moving only to shift from one seat to another. Even if you exercise on a regular basis that may not be enough. There is mounting evidence that exercise will not undo the damage done by prolonged sitting. Our technology has made us the most sedentary humans in history. So why is sitting so damaging? One thing it does is change the way our bodies deal with sugar. When you eat, your body breaks down the food into glucose, which is then transported in the blood to other cells. Glucose is an essential fuel but persistently high levels increase your risk of diabetes and heart disease. Your pancreas produces the hormone insulin to help get your glucose levels back down to normal, but how efficiently your body does that is affected by how physically active you are We wanted to see what would happen if we took a group of people who normally spend their day sitting in an office and ask them to spend a few hours a day on their feet instead. Standing while you are working may seem rather odd, but it is a practice with a long tradition. Winston Churchill wrote while working at a special standing desk, as did Ernest Hemingway and Benjamin Franklin. So with Dr John Buckley and a team of researchers from the University of Chester we conducted a simple experiment. We asked 10 people who work at an estate agents to stand for at least three hours a day for a week. Our lucky volunteers had mixed feelings about how they would get on. "It'll be different, but looking forward to it, yes…" "I think my feet might hurt - I'll have to wear sensible shoes…" "The small of my back, it's going to hurt…" "I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to stand up for all that time…[Laughs nervously]" We asked all the volunteers to wear an accelerometer - a movement monitor - to record just how much moving about they were doing. They also wore heart rate monitors and had glucose monitors that measured their blood sugar levels constantly, day and night. The evidence that standing up is good for you goes back to at least the 1950s when a study was done comparing bus conductors (who stand) with bus drivers (who don't). This study, published in the Lancet, showed that the bus conductors had around half the risk of developing heart disease of the bus drivers. Since then prolonged sitting has not only been linked to problems with blood glucose control, but also a sharp reduction in the activity of an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, which breaks down blood fats and makes them available as a fuel to the muscles. This reduction in enzyme activity leads to raised levels of triglycerides and fats in the blood, increasing the risk of heart disease. We had good reason to believe that standing would make a difference to our volunteers, but we were also a little anxious as to how they would get on. This was the first time an experiment like this had been conducted in the UK. Would our volunteers stick to it? They did. One woman with arthritis even found that standing actually improved her symptoms. The Chester researchers took measurements on days when the volunteers stood, and when they sat around. When they looked at the data there were some striking differences. As we had hoped, blood glucose levels fell back to normal levels after a meal far more quickly on the days when the volunteers stood than when they sat. There was also evidence, from the heart rate monitors that they were wearing, that by standing they were burning more calories. "If we look at the heart rates," John Buckley explains, "we can see they are quite a lot higher actually - on average around 10 beats per minute higher and that makes a difference of about 0.7 of a calorie per minute." Now that doesn't sound like much, but it adds up to about 50 calories an hour. If you stand for three hours a day for five days that's around 750 calories burnt. Over the course of a year it would add up to about 30,000 extra calories, or around 8lb of fat. "If you want to put that into activity levels," Dr Buckley says, "then that would be the equivalent of running about 10 marathons a year. Just by standing up three or four hours in your day at work." Dr Buckley thinks that although going out and doing exercise offers many proven benefits, our bodies also need the constant, almost imperceptible increase in muscle activity that standing provides. Simple movement helps us to keep our all-important blood sugar under control. We can't all stand up at work but the researchers believe that even small adjustments, like standing while talking on the phone, going over to talk to a colleague rather than sending an email, or simply taking the stairs, will help.

      <body>The year 1913 marked the beginning of an extraordinary relationship between an impoverished Indian clerk and a Cambridge don. A century later, their remarkable friendship has left its mark in the strangest of places, namely in Futurama, the animated series from The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and physics graduate David X Cohen. GH Hardy (1877-1947) and Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) were the archetypal odd couple. Hardy, whose parents were both teachers, grew up in a middle-class home in Surrey, England. At the age of two he was writing numbers that reached into the millions, so it was no surprise that he eventually read mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he joined an elite secret society known as the Cambridge Apostles. Ramanujan was born in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. At the age of two he survived a bout of smallpox, but his three younger siblings were less fortunate, each one dying in infancy. Although he was enrolled in a local school, Ramanujan's most valuable education was thanks to a library book, A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure Mathematics by GS Carr, which contained thousands of theorems. He investigated these theorems one by one, relying on a chalk and slate for calculations, using his roughened elbows as erasers. Aged 21, he married Janakiammal, who was just 10 years old. Unable to afford college fees and needing to support his wife, Ramanujan got a job as a clerk. Nevertheless, he continued his interest in mathematics in his spare time, developing novel ideas and proving fresh theorems. Curious about the value of his research, Ramanujan began to write to mathematicians in England in the hope that someone would mentor him, or at least give him feedback. Academics such as MJM Hill, HF Baker and EW Hobson largely ignored Ramanujan's pleas for help, but Hardy was mesmerised by the two packages he received in 1913, which contained a total of 120 theorems. Hardy's reaction veered between "fraud" and so brilliant that it was "scarcely possible to believe". In the end, he concluded that the theorems "must be true, because, if they were not true, no-one would have the imagination to invent them". The British professor made arrangements for the young Indian, still only 26, to visit Cambridge. Hardy took great pride in being the man who had rescued such raw talent and would later call it "the one romantic incident in my life". The resulting partnership gave rise to discoveries in several areas of mathematics and Ramanujan's genius was recognised in 1918 when he was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society. The young Indian savant would later say that many of his theorems were whispered to him in his sleep by Namagiri, an avatar of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi: "While asleep, I had an unusual experience. There was a red screen formed by flowing blood, as it were. I was observing it. Suddenly a hand began to write on the screen. I became all attention. That hand wrote a number of elliptic integrals. They stuck to my mind. As soon as I woke up, I committed them to writing." Ramanujan's career was brilliant, but ended prematurely when he began to suffer from tuberculosis. He returned to India in 1919 and died the following year, aged 32. However, the life of Ramanujan continues to fascinate modern mathematicians, including Dr Ken Keeler, who swapped his job as a researcher to join the writing team behind the science fiction sitcom Futurama. He is actually one of a number of mathematicians who write for The Simpsons and its sister series Futurama. They have retained their love for the subject and they continue to express their passion for numbers by smuggling mathematical references into both series. For example, in order to pay homage to Ramanujan, Keeler has repeatedly inserted 1,729 into Futurama, because this particular number cropped up in a famous conversation between Hardy and Ramanujan. According to Hardy, he visited Ramanujan in a nursing home in 1918: "I remember once going to see him when he was lying ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. 'No,' he replied. 'It is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.'" Their exchange can be unpacked and expressed as follows: 1,729 = 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³ It is rare that a number can be split into two positive cubes, and even rarer that it can be split into two positive cubes in two different ways, and 1,729 is the smallest number that exhibits this property. It is in recognition of Ramanujan's comment that Bender, Futurama's cantankerous robot, has the unit number 1729. The number also appears in an episode titled "The Farnsworth Parabox". The plot involves Futurama characters hopping between multiple universes, and one of them is labelled "Universe 1729". Moreover, the starship Nimbus has the hull registration number BP-1729. This has certainly helped keep Ramanujan's memory alive, but it is probably not the sort of immortality that Hardy had in mind when he wrote: "Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do not. Immortality may be a silly word, but probably a mathematician has the best chance of whatever it may mean." Keeler is proud of his mathematical references in Futurama, and he is philosophical about the many years he spent as a mathematician before becoming a comedy writer: "Everything that happens to us has some effect on us, and I do suppose that the time I spent in grad school made me a better writer. I certainly don't regret it. "For example, I chose Bender's serial number to be 1,729 and I think that reference alone completely justifies my doctorate. "I don't know if my thesis advisor sees it that way though." Simon Singh answered readers' questions on Twitter using #AskSimonSingh. Q: What is the second highest number after 1729 and do these numbers have a name? A: Mathematicians tend to focus on what is the smallest number that is the sum of 2 cubes in 3, 4, 5… ways. So 87539319 is smallest number that is the sum of 2 cubes in 3 ways. In "Bender's Big Score" Fry takes cab #87539319. Q: Can you write about Kaprekar's constant 6174 sometime? I think it's better than 1729! A: Not enough space to explain Kaprekar's constant, but I mention Harshad numbers in my book - Kaprekar invented (?) these too. Q: Why does mathematics scare such a large proportion of the public? A: I have a three-year-old son and can see that counting is not a natural process. Maybe the surprise that anybody ever gets maths? Q: I wouldn't say it is rare for a number to be a sum of two cubes, there are infinitely many such numbers. A: Fair point. Q: What is the next big conjecture to be proven? The Riemann Hypothesis? A: Mathematicians seem to rate The Riemann Hypothesis highly. Not something I would ever write about, as it's too complex for my writing talents. Q: What's the next number after 1729 for positive cubes? A: Not sure, but (as you hint) we can look at (-)ve cubes too. Bender's serial number is 2716057, which is 952³ + (-951)³. Q: I see that #AskSimonSingh is due to take place at 16:30BST. Could you reschedule it for 17:29BST? :) A: This is a very good idea. But it is 17.29 somewhere. Q: I don't have a question. I just want to say I really like you as a human being A: Thanks. I guess that is as opposed to liking me as an alien or an amoeba? Q: Why is the number 1,729 hidden in Futurama episodes? A: Many of the writers were mathematicians, and still love numbers, so this is their way of expressing that love. Q: Without computers, how was Ramanujan able to compute properties like the 1729? A: In a way 1729 spot was not miraculous. Many may know that 12³=1728, or 9³=729. Rest is easy. Except it seems that Ramanujan could do this over and over again. Every number was his personal friend.

      <title>Citizen science is the new black</title>
      <description>Are citizen science projects advancing our knowledge?</description>

      <body>Citizen science - the trend for involving amateurs in research projects - is all the rage nowadays but is it real science or just good PR? "This is a blob, nothing too impressive. Oh dear, another blob, these are elliptical galaxies. Ooh look this is a merger..." The Oxford astronomer Dr Chris Lintott flicks through the first of 70,000 images from UKIDSS, the UK Infrared Deep Sky Survey, that have been posted on the Galaxy Zoo website. "This one's a disc galaxy, so this might be what the Milky Way looks like from far away," he adds. The images, which have never been seen before, are part of the latest citizen science project run on the site. All you have to do is look at the pictures and classify the galaxies according to their shapes and features - does it have arms or a central bulge? Is it elliptical? Does the galaxy have a dust lane across the centre? The results should help astronomers to understand how galaxies form, but Galaxy Zoo is just the latest in a growing number of astronomical citizen science projects. The enthusiastic amateur can explore the surface of Mars or the Moon, study solar storms, and even hunt for planets orbiting distant stars. "It's a really exciting time," says Dr Lintott, "citizen science is booming. "That's because astronomers have painted themselves into a corner. They've got really good at collecting data but not so good at processing it. The human brain is still much better at sorting through these images and telling us what we need to know." But it is not just astronomy, citizen science is flourishing in pretty much every field of science. These days you can crunch data on cancer or monitor the spread of ash dieback while playing a simple computer game. You can map the human brain by colouring in neurones, track whales or watch wildlife in the Serengeti all from the comfort of your sofa. The field of natural history has a proud tradition of amateur involvement, and perhaps it is not so surprising to find citizen science flourishing here. According to the Joint Nature Conservation Committee there may be as many as 100,000 amateur naturalists actively collecting and contributing to citizen science projects in the UK - a volunteer effort worth £20m a year. A significant number of those projects are run by the Angela Marmont Centre for UK Biodiversity at the Natural History Museum. Members of the public are encouraged to drop in with specimens, and to access the museum's extensive collections and talk to research staff. When I arrived to meet Dr John Tweddle a fungi workshop was in full swing. "It's exciting actually. You never know who's going to come through the door and what they're going to come with," says Dr Tweddle. "Anyone of any ability can come here to access the collections. Citizen science is really booming at the moment and the most effective projects are actually driving the research agenda. It's really useful science," he added. Of course there is nothing new under the sun. Although he would not have been familiar with the term, Charles Darwin built his theory of evolution by natural selection on the evidence supplied by hundreds of citizen scientists all over the world. Some 15,000 of the letters he sent or received survive at the Darwin Correspondence Project in the Cambridge University Library. Associate director Alison Pearn says Darwin could never have compiled the astonishing wealth of evidence to support his theory without the enthusiastic support of amateur naturalists. "Darwin corresponded with people from all walks of life, plant and animal breeders, gardeners and naturalists, but also diplomats and explorers. He couldn't have achieved what he did without their support. They were eager to contribute to the broadening of knowledge, so it's exactly the same as people do today in what we call citizen science," says Ms Pearn. The computer has added enormously to the power that the amateur can bring to bear on a problem, but interestingly Dr Lintott argues, it is the human brain's unique ability to spot inconsistencies in the vast sets of data scientists have amassed that makes citizen science so useful. "The best and most powerful information processor we have is still the one sitting between our ears. The human brain has a remarkable capacity for pattern recognition, but also for spotting the unusual, for being distracted by something that doesn't quite fit, and that's what we really need," he adds. </body>

      <title>Red destination: Choosing an ExoMars landing site</title>
      <description>Where should Europe's Mars rover try to land?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24466042</url>
      <date>1381536819</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70385000/png/_70385861_vlcsnap-2013-10-09-11h43m13s97.png</thumbnail>
      <body>The search for a suitable site to land Europe's ExoMars rover in 2019 is about to begin. A request will go out in the next few weeks to the scientific community, asking for expressions of interest to join a working group on the subject. Once this panel is in place, planetary researchers will then be invited to a meeting, likely to be in the spring of next year. This will formally kick-off the site selection process, which should take a couple of years to complete. The European Space Agency's ExoMars rover - a roughly 350kg vehicle - is currently in the late stages of its design. Its mission will be to scour the surface of the Red Planet for signs of past or present life. It will have a drill to pull samples up from 2m down, and instruments to assess any organic chemistry that might be present. But choosing the right place to go on Mars is critical to the whole endeavour. "I expect before the end of this month to issue the call to the science community, asking them for letters of interest in becoming a member of the site selection working group," Jorge Vago, Esa's ExoMars project scientist, told me. "We hope this will generate some buzz, and we hope to appoint the working group in November. It will consist of 10-12 external scientists, the project scientists and people from industry. "I would expect by the middle of next year we should have zeroed in on about four top candidate sites to start studying in detail." The scientific community will propose and argue the merits of various candidate destinations; new satellite imagery will be commissioned to inform the discussions. "Best science" will not, however, be the only consideration in making the ultimate decision. There are very important engineering constraints as well. No landing system yet devised can put down on a sixpence; the best you can hope for is a zone of confidence. Even for the brilliant "skycrane" used by the American's Curiosity rover, there was an ellipse of uncertainty that measured 20km by 7km at the final estimate. ExoMars' landing system is being constructed by the Russians and will be reminiscent of the Lunokhod Moon landers of the 1970s. The expected error ellipse will be considerably larger - about 100km by 15km. This means that wherever the scientists might like to go, the engineers will need to satisfy themselves that the rover can actually get there with minimal risk. So, for example, Gale Crater, the current location of Curiosity, would appear to be off the list of potential destinations because the Russian system will not have the accuracy to put ExoMars in this deep hole. The preponderance of slopes and boulder fields will be a consideration. And because ExoMars is a solar-powered rover, it will also be tied relatively close to the equator. So where will ExoMars go? Favoured Locations that lost out for Curiosity's attention are sure to crop up again. If I were to nominate an early runner in the race, it would probably be Mawrth Vallis. This is a favourite among many European planetary scientists, and is the location where Esa's Mars Express Orbiter spied abundant deposits of magnesium-rich and iron-rich clay minerals - a clear sign that a lot of water was once in contact with the rocks over an extended period. To find evidence of life, you must follow the water. Prof Dawn Sumner, who was co-chair of the Curiosity landing site working group, told me: "Mawrth Vallis is a site of exposed ancient martian crust - crust that is likely older than any rocks we've found on Earth. "The rocks there show spectral signatures of diverse hydrous minerals in data from Mars Express and Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. "These spectral signatures, within the oldest crust, make this site attractive, because it provides an opportunity to study the formation and alteration of some of the oldest parts of Mars. "Mawrth Vallis, like most of the ancient martian crust, shows evidence of multiple impacts; it is the high concentration of impact craters that indicates that it is old. "These areas show evidence of multiple fracturing events due to impacts, and the Mawrth Vallis landing ellipse identified as a Curiosity candidate shows many fracture patterns that may be related to various impact-forming events. The fracture patterns vary in the area and may be part of the landing site selection considerations." Wherever ExoMars goes, it will be given an initial mission lasting 218 martian days, or sols. It will get rolling quickly to make the most of the opportunity, and in this past week some of those who'll be involved have been getting a feel for what surface operations will involve. A dummy control room has been set up at the Satellite Applications Catapult in Harwell, Oxfordshire, from where instrument teams have been sending commands to a prototype rover in the Atacama Desert. The boulder fields of this Chilean landscape look just like Mars, and it is cold and dry to boot. Twice a day, the Harwell team has been examining pictures acquired by the prototype, known as "Bridget", and then directing it to various targets to investigate. The commands are sent to the "relay orbiter" (in reality, a support team in the desert), where they are checked and uploaded into the rover. Bridget does its stuff, examining rocks with its "hand lens" and imaging the sub-surface with radar, before returning the data to England to repeat the exploration cycle. "Operations is a very different discipline from design and testing; and you have to get people into a different mind-set," says Lester Waugh from Astrium, the big European space company that is leading the manufacture of the ExoMars rover. "You think very much about risk, because if there is any danger that the rover may be damaged, you have to think very seriously before doing something - because you could lose your mission." </body>

      <title>Can science fiction ever get the science right?</title>
      <description>How accurate is the science in modern science fiction?</description>

      <body>New film Gravity promises to rekindle the debate over how "hard" - or accurate - science fiction should be. Should film-makers adhere to basic scientific principles, or should audiences just feel the magic instead, asks Peter Ray Allison. The relationship between science and science fiction has always been tempestuous. Gravity focuses on two astronauts stranded in space after the destruction of their space shuttle. Since Gravity's US release (it comes to the UK in November) many critics have praised the film for its scientific accuracy. But noted astrophysicist Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, had several issues with the accuracy of Gravity's portrayal of space. Through a series of posts on Twitter, Tyson - who later emphasised that he "enjoyed the film very much" - highlighted various errors. He noted the Hubble space telescope (orbiting at 350 miles above sea level), the International Space Station (at 250 miles), and a Chinese space station could never be in line of sight of one another. On top of that, most satellites orbit west to east, yet in the film the satellite debris was seen drifting east to west. Tyson also noted how Sandra Bullock's hair did not float freely as it would in zero-gravity. This is arguably not so much an error in physics, but a reflection of the limitations of cinematic technology to accurately portray actors in zero-gravity. That is, of course, without sending them into space for the duration of the film. There has always been a drive for scientific accuracy within science fiction, especially within the "hard science fiction" literary sub-genre. But sci-fi, especially in film, tends to have a more flamboyant approach, where realism is often dispensed with in favour of visual flair. The Michael Bay film Armageddon is known for its woeful number of inaccuracies, from the space shuttles separating their rocket boosters and fuel tanks in close proximity to each other (risking a collision) and to objects falling on to the asteroid under a gravitational pull seemingly as strong as the Earth's. More than one interested observer tried to work out how big the bomb would have to be to blow up an asteroid in the way demanded in the movie. Answer: Very big indeed. Nasa is reported to have even used Armageddon as part of a test within their training programme, asking candidates to identify all the scientific impossibilities within the film. Despite the presence of physicist Prof Brian Cox as a scientific adviser on Danny Boyle's Sunshine, artistic licence seeped in. There's a communications "dead-zone" around the Sun - not something easily explicable using real world rules. Despite claims to the contrary, Red Planet was riddled with scientific implausibilities, from the compatibility between modern equipment and 30-year old Russian technology (imagine attempting to connect a modern PC with a Sinclair Spectrum), to the Martian "nematodes" which had been eating algae that had been sent from earth for the past 30 years. The nematodes should have been worms but looked closer to beetles. And there was no explanation as to how they had evolved to eat non-Martian algae nor what they had eaten before. The science across the film was so "creative" that Nasa refused to act as scientific adviser on the film. But perhaps the biggest example of scientific licence occurs in a plethora of space-based dramas. "The most commonly lauded example of 'bad science', intentionally placed into science fiction, is that of sound," says Ed Trollope, spacecraft operations engineer at technology firm Telespazio VEGA Deutschland. "Because space is a vacuum, there is no sound, which means all those explosions and engine noises shouldn't be there." There's a simple cinematic reason for having the sound of an explosion when a spacecraft blows up - it feels right to the viewer. But other conventions are more difficult for scientists to accept. "My pet peeve is inertia," says Trollope. "There are many good reasons for keeping your engines on in space, but 'maintaining speed' is not one of them. If you turn your engines off, you don't stop." Some do it slightly better than others. "I'd prefer not to single out a single film/book/series for this particular error, because it's so common - but I will laud the old television show Babylon 5, for doing a wonderful job of representing the mechanics of spaceflight inertia so nicely," explains Trollope. 2001: A Space Odyssey's silent scenes of space craft, with their rotating Stanford torus design, were closer than many later examples to the reality of travelling in space. "A classic case of scientific inaccuracy was the first edition of Ringworld by Larry Niven, a novel which won both the Hugo and Nebula awards in 1971," suggests science fiction author Charles Stross. "The author inadvertently set up a series of scenes which implied that the Earth spun on its axis in the wrong direction." Niven fixed it in the second printing. The Duncan Jones film Moon was lauded for a reasonably accurate portrayal of what lunar mining for Helium-3 could look like in the future. Helium-3 is rare on Earth but less rare on the Moon, and using an automated method with a human overseer might be possible. But the economics behind the mining is not explained. The alien signal in Contact is a prime example of what Seti (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) is looking for. This is perhaps not surprising as Contact was written by astronomer Carl Sagan. The use of mathematics in the transmission of the message seems reasonable and the time lag in the sending and receiving of the signal is also accurately represented in the film. Science fiction is not just expected to accurately portray science but also to anticipate future developments. "Science fiction hits some predictive targets," says science fiction author Neal Asher, "but rather in the way that a clip fired from an assault rifle will hit some of the enemy hidden in the jungle, but mostly hits trees and leaves." "One of the past criticisms of science fiction has been that it's all 'zap-guns and rocket ships'," suggests Asher. "Now the science fiction writer can smugly point out the LaWs - the US navy laser system - knocking down drones, and then wax lyrical about the X Prize, Virgin Galactic and Elon Musk's SpaceX." Richard Blott, principal consultant at Space Enterprise Partnerships, recalls an early episode of Star Trek ("Spock's Brain", 1968) where the latest space ship is described as having an "ion drive". "Nowadays most new communications satellites have ion engines and they have powered missions to Vesta and Ceres," says Blott. "In the end," Asher concludes, "science fiction is not there to make accurate predictions about the future, it is there to entertain and stimulate the imagination. There is absolutely no doubt that many of the imaginations it stimulates belong to scientists. To some extent it drives and directs science."

      <description>Progress in science has never observed national borders</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24477064</url>

      <body>Science can only develop by ignoring national borders, says Lisa Jardine. Since its modern beginnings in the 17th Century, science has been the most global of pursuits. Information and experimentation have criss-crossed national borders, as the curious have tried to explain the properties of natural phenomena. Marie Curie, discoverer of radium and winner of two Nobel prizes, put the matter characteristically bluntly: "Science is essentially international. It is only through lack of a historical sense that national qualities have been attributed to it." Not that you would think so if you have followed the science news this week. As the Nobel prizes for 2013 have been announced, each nation's media have rushed to claim the winners as their own. "Three Americans win joint Nobel prize for medicine," shouted the headline in the New York Times. "A German and two Americans win the Nobel prize for medicine," counter-claimed Der Spiegel. One of this year's winners is indeed German born and trained, though he has worked for many years in the United States. On Tuesday the prize for physics went, as expected, to Britain's (or should that be Scotland's) Peter Higgs. Of the five other physicists who could lay claim to having made crucial early theoretical breakthroughs in relation to the Higgs-Boson particle, it was Francois Englert of Belgium alone who shared the prize with Higgs. Predictably, every Belgian newspaper I consulted on Wednesday morning ran a banner headline along the lines of "Belgian wins Nobel prize for physics", relegating Higgs to the second or third paragraph. Higgs and Englert published their theories of how certain particles acquire mass independently in 1964 - Higgs working in Edinburgh, and Englert and his long-term colleague Robert Brout in Brussels. It has been characteristic of advances in science since the beginning that a single problem is worked on - and ultimately solved at about the same time - by individuals and teams in different countries, who read the same papers, correspond and meet intermittently at academic conferences. An example on a much more modest scale from the period closest to my own heart as a historian, the 17th Century, is the investigation of a phenomenon known today as Prince Rupert's drops. As it happens, this too linked scientists in Britain and the Low Countries. If a globule of molten glass is dropped into a bucket of cold water, it cools to form a tear-shaped drop of a size that fits into the palm of your hand with a long, slender tail. This tadpole-shaped drop has extraordinary properties. The main body of the tear is remarkably strong - you can stand on it, or hit it with a hammer, without it breaking. But if the tiniest fragment is broken from the tail, the entire drop shatters and explodes with a loud bang, disintegrating into dust - watch one shatter in this clip from Smarter Every Day on YouTube. This combination of strength and weakness, and its potential explosive possibilities, demanded an explanation. Prince Rupert's drops seem first to have attracted scientific interest in Germany in the 1640s. By the 1650s they were being examined and discussed in France and the Netherlands, with a whole range of theories being produced concerning the drop's strange properties. One of the earliest recorded attempts at an explanation involved the Dutch polymath Sir Constantijn Huygens and the amateur scientist Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle. Cavendish was domiciled in Antwerp at the time, exiled from Britain during the Commonwealth period. In a letter to her following a visit, Huygens recorded a conversation they had about the drops - at the time known as "Dutch tears" - in her private chemistry laboratory. There, each week, she apparently "dirtied several white petticoats" worn as overalls to protect her clothing while she conducted experiments. Enclosing several specimens, Huygens begs her to investigate their properties. "The King of France is as yet unresolved in the question, notwithstanding he hath been curious to move it to an assembly of the best philosophers of Paris." The duchess replied a week later. She expressed her gratitude to Huygens for seeking her opinion. In her view, the cause of the explosion when the tip of the drop was broken was that there was a tiny quantity of volatile material trapped inside which reacted violently on contact with air. With a nice feminine touch, she observed that if liquid had somehow been inserted into the drops (actually, the drops contain no liquid) it would have required no greater skill than that employed to make fashionable glass earrings. "Women wear at their ears for pendants as great wonders, glass bobs with narrow necks as these glasses have tails, and yet it is filled with several colours silks and coarse black cotton-wool, which to my sense is more difficult to put into these glass pendants, than liquor into these glass guns." The correspondence continued for some weeks, though neither party could come up with anything like an acceptable explanation. In 1661, the properties of the "glass bubbles" were demonstrated at a meeting of the recently formed Royal Society in London. Several of its founding members had recently returned from continental Europe at the Restoration of Charles II - including the king's German cousin Prince Rupert, who gave his name to the drops. So it is not surprising that specimens of what diarist Samuel Pepys called "Chymicall glasses" came with them. "The king sent by Sir Paul Neile five little glass bubbles," the minutes of the meeting record, "in order to have the judgement of the society concerning them." Anxious to impress the king (whose financial support the society was actively seeking) the members responded immediately. More drops were produced and experimented on two days later, and a full report of the experiments given to the society at its weekly meeting by the president. These were shared with the French traveller Balthasar de Monconys when he attended the Royal Society. He made his own French translation of the report, and discussed the drops and their properties with the scientific community in Leiden when he visited shortly afterwards. It was my scientific hero Robert Hooke, the society's curator of experiments - the person in charge of those experiments recorded in 1661 - who made an important early contribution to explaining this strange phenomenon, based on the differential cooling of the glass itself after it was plunged into water, and drawing an analogy with the way the locked stones in brick arches collapse instantaneously and violently once the keystone is removed. Hooke used his new microscope to examine drops which had been shattered, but held intact with strong glue. His contributions to a theoretical explanation cover 11 closely-argued pages in his 1665 Micrographia. In the 19th Century the great Lord Kelvin added his contribution. But the behaviour of these "Dutch tears" was not fully explained until the 1920s. So multiple connections between at least four European nations contributed to the eventual properly scientific understanding of "Prince Rupert's drops". I might add that Margaret Cavendish's involvement in the story is not her only appearance in early modern science. Pepys described in his diary a sensational London social event in 1667, when the duchess paid a ceremonial visit to the Royal Society at the invitation of its president and fellows - the only woman to do so before the modern era. Among the experiments carried out for her were several involving Robert Boyle's famous "evacuating engine" or air pump. It is tempting for the historian to claim landmark events in science on behalf of the nation to which he or she belongs. I have come close to doing as much myself, when I hinted that Hooke might have been the first to provide an explanation for the behaviour of Prince Rupert's drops. Brian Cox begins his recent Science Britannica TV series by announcing: "In these films I want to explore Britain's pivotal role in creating modern science." But science has always ignored national borders, in pursuit of the fullest possible understanding of nature. Even at the height of the Anglo-Dutch wars in the mid-17th Century, correspondence full of information and data continued to be exchanged uncensored between Dutch scientists and the Royal Society in London. Higgs and Englert have been quick to point out that the crucial experimental work at CERN that confirmed their Nobel-prize winning theoretical breakthrough was the result of global teamwork, involving thousands of researchers and almost 100 nationalities. To be true to the benefits of a scientific future we have to honour its equally international past. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>SNP pledges energy bill cut post Yes</title>
      <description>Scotland's deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon unveils plans to cut energy bills by 5% a year in an independent Scotland.</description>

      <body>Scotland's deputy first minister has unveiled plans to cut energy bills by about 5% a year if the country votes for independence. Nicola Sturgeon told the SNP's conference in Perth the reduction of about £70 would be achieved by removing a number of "green" charges. She believed the measure would not be a short-term fix, but a "real and lasting cut". People in Scotland vote in an independence referendum next year. On Thursday, 18 September, 2014, they will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?" Ms Sturgeon explained that two schemes worth up to half of the green costs imposed on energy companies would be removed from the bills of consumers. The minister told the party's annual gathering: "Right now, the Scottish government invests around £80m a year on energy efficiency schemes to help meet our climate change targets and lower the costs of energy bills. "A further £120m comes from a scheme designed in Westminster, operated through energy companies and paid for by a levy on your gas and electricity bills. "It is a disjointed approach, it doesn't take account of Scottish priorities and it's not as efficient as it could be." Ms Sturgeon went on to announce that an SNP government in an independent Scotland would remove the energy saving measures and the warm home discount from energy bills. She said the current system would be replaced by a more joined-up approach with funding for fuel poverty schemes - worth up to £200m per year - coming directly from government. Ms Sturgeon added: "Independence will allow us to tackle fuel poverty much more directly, delivering Scottish solutions to Scottish problems, and ensuring that energy companies always behave in a socially responsible way to protect vulnerable customers." She insisted the energy schemes would be delivered more effectively and it would save hard-pressed consumers money. The SNP deputy leader told the conference: "We estimate that it will cut energy bills by around 5% - or £70 a year. "Not a short-term measure - but a real and lasting cut in Scottish energy bills." The minister went on to demand that the coalition government at Westminster ditch its spare room subsidy, which is described by critics as the ''bedroom tax''. But she said if it refused to act, the current Scottish government would allocate "up to £20m" for a second year to help those who have been affected. Ms Sturgeon also announced that the Holyrood administration would fund the Poverty Alliance to deliver a Living Wage Accreditation Scheme to "promote the living wage and increase the number of private companies that pay it". Turning to the issue of health, Ms Sturgeon said a UK-wide approach "would be the worst thing that could ever happen to the Scottish NHS". She added: "Westminster privatisation of the NHS is not wanted in Scotland. "Scotland's national health service is staying in public hands." Ms Sturgeon went on to warn that Westminster MPs in all the UK parties were "itching to abolish the Barnett formula and cut Scotland's share of spending". She said: "So, I say this to everyone yet to make up their mind [on independence]. Consider carefully the arguments for a Yes vote. Subject them to scrutiny and ask the tough questions. "But do not ever let anyone pull the wool over your eyes about the consequences of a No vote. "They are clear and they are real. Scotland's social security system will be dismantled; Scotland's public services and universal benefits will be under threat and Scotland's budget will be cut. "The risks of a No vote are real." Ms Sturgeon promised that the Scottish government's White Paper on independence, which is due to be published next month, would "answer all your questions". She added: "The White Paper will be Scotland's detailed guide to independence. "It will make the positive case. It will explain the process by which we will become independent and describe how our newly independent country will work. "It will set out the gains of independence for you, your family and for your community." Towards the end of her speech, Ms Sturgeon said: "The vote in 2014 is not a vote for or against the SNP. "It is a vote for or against the power to take decisions in Scotland." She insisted that an SNP government after independence would bring the mail service back into public ownership; reverse welfare reforms; protect state pensions and get rid of Trident nuclear weapons. </body>

      <title>PM backs 'illegal immigrant' texts</title>
      <description>David Cameron backs the 'principle' of sending warning text messages to suspected illegal immigrants - even though some have gone to the wrong people.</description>

      <body>David Cameron "agrees with the principle" of sending text messages suggesting the recipients are illegal immigrants, despite some going to the wrong people, his spokesman has said. The Home Office says just 14 people out of a total of 58,800 contacted were mistakenly asked if they had overstayed their visas. But campaigners say the true number of people wrongly contacted is far higher. Labour described the government's tactic as "shambolic and incompetent". Some people suspected of having outstayed their visas were sent a text reading: "Our records show you may not have leave to remain in the UK. Please contact us to discuss your case." The prime minister's official spokesman acknowledged that the wording of the texts had changed since the campaign began. Originally, they had included the phrase: "You are required to leave the UK as you no longer have the right to remain." The Home Office said it was "right to enforce the rules", and Mr Cameron's spokesman said: "The prime minister agrees with the principle of the texts. "It is one of various means the Home Office contacts people who may not have the right to remain in the UK." But two recipients of the texts - campaigner Suresh Grover and immigration lawyer Bobby Chan - reacted angrily to the message. "I came here with my parents in 1966, I was born in East Africa and have a British passport," Mr Grover told the Independent newspaper - adding he was "shocked" and "horrified" to be contacted in this way. Mr Chan said the texts "stereotype immigrants as a criminal community and create an atmosphere of fear". But the Home Office defended its position: "We are taking proactive steps to contact individuals who records show have no valid right to be in the UK." The individuals affected had been contacted in a variety of ways, including email and text, it added. It also denied that Mr Grover had been contacted at all. Mr Grover told the BBC he would instruct his lawyers to write to the Home Office, challenging its claim he had not received the text directly. The department has received more than 140 complaints about the campaign, although Capita said: "Most complaints occurred in the early part of the contract where Capita was, as part of the contract, updating sometimes out-of-date Home Office records." Capita believes that 4,160 people have departed the UK since December 2012 as a result as a result of being contacted, the Home Office said. Labour's shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: "Theresa May's immigration system lurches from one gimmick to another with little effect. "The reports that the government has allowed a private contractor to send British citizens text message telling them to leave the country demonstrates once more just how shambolic and incompetent the Home Office's border police is under Theresa May. "These messages will rightly cause distress and offence to British citizens, many of whom have done much to contribute to our society. It is simply wrong for this sort of message to be sent by text, and to be so poorly targeted." UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who campaigns for tighter border controls and Britain's exit from the EU, said the text message scheme was the product of a government with "absolutely zero sensibility and even less sense". "To send threatening text messages and emails to people on some sort of clearly ill-managed central database is deeply disturbing and the sort of behaviour one would expect from a fascistic police state, not a democratic and inclusive nation. Quite frankly it's abhorrent." UKIP MEP candidate Amjad Bashir said: "I find it utterly repugnant that people like me, who may have been born abroad but who are passport-holding and hard-working citizens of the UK are being threatened by the government in this way." Meanwhile, immigration minister Mark Harper has said that vans telling illegal immigrants in London to "go home or face arrest" could be deployed across the UK. He told BBC One's Question Time that the government was assessing the results of the scheme, which was piloted in the capital earlier this year. During July, they were driven around the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow for a week. Labour accused ministers of "borrowing the language" used by the National Front in the 1970s. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said the campaign had been "stupid and offensive". Earlier this month, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned the posters, saying they had misled the public about the arrest statistics displayed. However, it cleared the campaign of being offensive and irresponsible. Mr Harper told Question Time: "I don't have any problem with saying to people who are here illegally that they shouldn't be here anymore." </body>

      <title>Portillo 'misspeaks' on pleb claims</title>
      <description>Michael Portillo says he "misspoke" when he claimed he had sometimes heard former Conservative chief whip Andrew Mitchell use the word "pleb" in private.</description>

      <body>Michael Portillo has said he "misspoke" when he claimed he had heard former Conservative chief whip Andrew Mitchell say the word "pleb". Mr Mitchell resigned his post in 2012 after Downing Street police accused him of calling them plebs during a row - a word he denied having used. In a live discussion on the BBC's This Week, Mr Portillo revealed: "I have heard him use that word in private conversation - the pleb word, I mean." But he now says he got "carried away". Pressed on the This Week programme on Thursday about whether he had heard Mr Mitchell use the word, Mr Portillo said: "I think I did, but not in a bad context. "Some policeman thought: 'Ah, that's a word that people will believe that Andrew Mitchell might have used.' "But he wouldn't have used it in that context." On Friday, the former Conservative cabinet minister added: "I seem to have misspoken. I had no right to say that. "I think I got carried away in the heat of the moment. I did not mean to say it and I want to withdraw it." The former politician, who served as defence secretary under John Major, is a regular pundit on the show. Mr Mitchell admitted swearing during the September 2012 row with police officers who said he could not ride his bicycle through the main Downing Street gate. But he also maintained: "I think most people who know me know I would not use words like pleb or moron in describing anyone." The Conservative MP has claimed that the officers involved conspired against him in a bid to "toxify" his party. After a meeting with Mr Mitchell at his Sutton Coldfield constituency office in October 2012, three local representatives of the Police Federation criticised the MP for casting doubt on the Downing Street officers' version of events, said he had refused to disclose the exact words he had used in the row, and had "no option but to resign". Mr Mitchell says he has a transcript contradicting their account of the meeting. The chiefs of West Mercia, West Midlands and Warwickshire police forces concluded that no disciplinary action was needed against their officers, even though an internal investigation by West Mercia Police had initially said there was a "case to answer for misconduct". The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has said the officers who spoke to Mr Mitchell should have faced misconduct hearings, and Prime Minister David Cameron has said the MP is "owed an apology". Eight people have been arrested and bailed under Scotland Yard's investigation into the affair, including five police officers. The Crown Prosecution Service is considering whether to bring criminal charges against any of them. </body>

      <title>Cable defends Royal Mail sale price</title>
      <description>Business Secretary Vince Cable defends the 330p flotation price of Royal Mail on a day when shares in the company briefly touched £5.</description>

      <body>Business Secretary Vince Cable has defended the 330p flotation price of Royal Mail on a day when shares in the company briefly touched £5. Value for money was important, but it was "about more than just the level of proceeds received on day one" of the flotation, he said in a letter to MPs. Some big investors declined to invest in Royal Mail, while others were uneasy about possible strike action, he added. The remarks were made to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. In the letter, Mr Cable says the price was set to ensure a successful transaction, good value, the ability to sell off the remaining government stake in the business and it being able to access finance from the markets. The price range was determined using market testing which involved consulting with a core group of 20 investment institutions. It was also priced relative to comparable companies operating elsewhere in Europe. He said that the threat of industrial action by the postal workers' union was also a factor that influenced the initial price range. "There were some investors who stated that they were not willing to invest at all and many others who focused on the business and financial implications of strike action," Mr Cable said. The letter says it was the banks employed to coordinate the sale - Goldman Sachs and UBS - that recommended the 260p to 330p price range for the shares. This was also endorsed by the government's independent adviser, the investment bank Lazard. The consultation process with investors, known as "pilot fishing", revealed that there would be sufficient demand for shares at the bottom of the range, even with the threat of industrial action. A slightly lower upper end for the price range was initially recommended. That was subsequently revised upwards "following ongoing positive feedback", he said. The final 330p float price was agreed based on final demand indications. It was endorsed by Lazard. The investment bank has now been asked to appear before the BIS Select committee amid concerns that Royal Mail was sold off too cheaply. When it became clear the share offer was many times oversubscribed (20 times for the institutional offer, seven times for the retail offer) the government did consider revising the price upwards. But this was not done "based on an assessment of the composition of demand... and an assessment of where demand would taper off," Mr Cable writes. There was also a view that this would introduce an "execution risk" to the sell off. Mr Cable said the banks helping with the sell off "recommended against increasing the price range; this advice was endorsed by Lazard". The letter does not address why the current price of Royal Mail has gone so high. But its understood the government believes this is down to the scarcity of shares available. It also believes hedge funds - some from the US - may be buying at this elevated price in the belief that Royal Mail may be transformed and modernised quicker than anticipated. </body>

      <title>Lib Dems 'veer left like a trolley'</title>
      <description>Lib Dem MP Jeremy Browne, recently sacked as a Home Office minister, compares his party to a faulty shopping trolley that "defaults to the left".</description>

      <body>Lib Dem MP Jeremy Browne, who was sacked as a Home Office minister in a recent reshuffle, has compared his party to a faulty shopping trolley that "defaults to the left". In an interview with the Times, he said he had spent years trying to exert "corrective pressure" on the Lib Dems to make them a "party of government". Now they were in danger of becoming a "party of protest" again, he warned. "We must avoid facing inwards," he told the newspaper. Mr Browne had been regarded as one of Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg's closest allies before the reshuffle and a rising star within the party. He was replaced at the Home Office by fellow Lib Dem MP Norman Baker, seen as being on the left of the party. Mr Browne described his sacking as "puzzling" and "a bit painful". "I saw my role, and continue to do so, as doing everything I can to accelerate the Lib Dems' journey from a party of protest to a party of government," he said. The MP for Taunton Deane, in Somerset, continued: "If the Lib Dems look ambivalent about being in government we can hardly then complain if people assume that its successes must be down to the party that doesn't look ambivalent. "You can't be half in and half out of government. We have to avoid the trap of looking like a party that is a reluctant party of government and looking uncomfortable and that we'd be grateful to be relieved of our collective responsibilities. "There is a role in politics for stopping things you don't want to happen, but I want the greatest emphasis to be on what we have managed to achieve rather than what we have managed to prevent the Conservatives from achieving." Mr Browne was appointed a Foreign Office minister when the Lib Dem/Tory coalition government was formed in 2010 and was moved to the Home Office in 2012. At the Lib Dem conference in September, he accused the Liberal Democrats of being "uncomfortable" with wealth creation and always wanting "to demonstrate our disapproval of people becoming wealthy and successful and creating jobs in our economy". He also called for a debate on whether Muslim girls should be banned from wearing full-face veils in some public places. He ruled out defecting to the Conservative Party in his Times interview, saying he had turned down the offer of a meeting with Tory chairman Grant Shapps. He told the newspaper he planned to fight the next election as a Liberal Democrat. "I had no intention or desire to defect to the Conservatives," he added. </body>

      <body>Sun journalist Nick Parker and a second man will be charged by police over the theft of an MP's mobile phone in 2010. Mr Parker, 52, from south-west London, is accused of one count of receiving stolen goods and one of unauthorised access to computer material. Michael Ankers, 29, from south-west London, faces one count of theft of a phone belonging to Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh. Both men will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 6 November. Gregor McGill, a lawyer at the Crown Prosecution Service, said there was insufficient evidence to charge another suspect in relation to the case. Ms McDonagh, who has represented Mitcham and Morden since 1997, had her mobile phone stolen from her car in Colliers Wood in south-west London on 17 October 2010. The accusations against Parker and Ankers bring to three the number of people charged under Operation Tuleta, a Scotland Yard investigation focused on computer hacking and other alleged privacy breaches. Operation Tuleta began in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. It is being run by the Metropolitan Police alongside Operation Elveden, which is an investigation into inappropriate payments to public officials, and Operation Weeting, the Met's phone-hacking inquiry. Mr Parker has already been charged with three counts of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office over payments to officials. The Independent Police Complaints Commission has also made three arrests under inquiries linked to the investigations. </body>

      <title>Offer seat to pregnant women - Cable</title>
      <description>Vince Cable enters the debate about whether pregnant MP Jo Swinson should have been offered a seat by colleagues.</description>

      <body>Vince Cable has waded into the debate about whether a heavily pregnant MP should have been offered a seat by colleagues in the Commons. Jo Swinson, who is seven months pregnant, stood next to other MPs for half an hour at Prime Minster's Questions on Wednesday. The Lib Dem equalities minister has said she wanted to stand. But that has not stopped Mr Cable and others calling for a return to more chivalrous behaviour. The business secretary said: "I didn't see the incident. "But I think as a matter of basic consideration and good manners people should offer their seat to someone who's visibly pregnant. I'd have thought that was just automatic. "The old tradition of men offering seats to women has long gone but I think if somebody is heavily pregnant or is disabled, basic decency suggests you should give them preference." Ms Swinson, a junior minister at Mr Cable's business department, has declined interview requests about the matter, which was sparked by Twitter comments on Wednesday, after she had been spotted standing in the Commons chamber. Writing on Twitter on Thursday, she joked: "About to get on the Tube - seat offers welcome and definitely not sexist :o) But I was happier standing at pmqs yesterday." Ms Swinson, who represents East Dunbartonshire, is married to fellow Lib Dem MP Duncan Hames. The Spectator magazine's political editor James Forsyth caused a flurry of comments when he tweeted about Ms Swinson on Wednesday. "Quite remarkable that no MP has offered Jo Swinson, who is seven months pregnant, a seat. Really shocking lack of manners and decency," said Mr Forsyth. According to the Daily Mail, a source close to Ms Swinson said the suggestion that she had been unable to "fend for herself" was "quite sexist". But David Cameron appeared to disagree with this view. Asked if the prime minister would offer a pregnant woman a seat if he were to find himself on a bus, his official spokesman said: "I'm sure he would. "If we take the example of public transport, if you see someone who is in greater need of a seat than yourself, then offering that seat is the right thing to do," he said. Ms Swinson's child, her first, is due on Christmas Day, according to reports. The MP did manage to find a seat on the government front bench later on Wednesday, when most MPs had left the chamber. </body>

      <title>Life sentence for human trafficking</title>
      <description>A maximum life sentence for the worst cases of human trafficking and exploitation is to be introduced.</description>

      <body>A maximum life sentence for the worst cases of human trafficking and exploitation is to be introduced. It comes after Home Secretary Theresa May said tougher sanctions would be brought in to tackle modern-day slavery earlier this year. The number of cases discovered in the UK has risen by 25% in the last year, according to government figures. Trafficking from Albania, Poland and Lithuania has seen a big rise. Ministers are planning new legislation to simplify the law on slavery, and make it easier to bring prosecutions. Victims are often targeted for sexual exploitation, construction work or begging gangs. A new report by the inter-departmental ministerial group on human trafficking has revealed that 1,186 victims were referred to the authorities in 2012, compared with 946 victims in 2011. The report revealed the largest number of victims were from Nigeria, Vietnam, Albania, Romania and China. There has been a 300% increase in Albanian trafficking, a 171% increase in victims from Lithuania, and 148% more from Poland since 2011, the report indicated. But trafficking from Romania and China had fallen, according to the figures. Victims brought to the UK are forced to do anything from work as house slaves to labour in cannabis farms. Eastern European women are most likely to be used as prostitutes, according to the report. Men are most likely to be used for construction work. There is also a trend towards forced begging, and benefit fraud - gangmasters take all the proceeds, returning very little to victims. Those targeted are often lured to the UK with the promise of free travel, a job and accommodation, sometimes by family members. An alternative is so-called 'debt bonds' where money owed must be repaid by working in the UK. Klara Skrivankova, from the Anti-Slavery International group, wants greater protection for victims - including the right to stay in the UK. "Tougher penalties and longer sentences alone do not suffice," she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. "Unless the protection of victims is put on a statutory footing, we're unlikely to see more prosecutions." Victims minister Damian Green said the trafficking of vulnerable men and women was something "no civilised country should tolerate". "On Anti-Slavery Day I am proud that this government is standing strong against those who profit from human misery and last year gave £3m to support those who have suffered at their hands." Chief constable Shaun Sawyer of the Association of Chief Police Officers said "the national approach is very much about the protection of the victim", but he added: "I agree that the signposting and signalling could be clearer". "A lot of people are prosecuted for GBH, rape, violence against the individual - it's far easier to bring the perpetrator to justice this way. This Bill will make it easier to prosecute for trafficking." David Hanson MP, Labour's shadow immigration minister, said that the government needed to focus on prosecutions, pointing to the last government report which identified 946 potential victims of human trafficking, but "only eight convictions". "The government also needs to wake up to the fact that 60% of trafficked children simply go missing again in the UK after they've come to the attention of the authorities," he added. "It should be a source of shame." In her Tory party conference speech, Mrs May said an order banning someone convicted of trafficking from being a gangmaster after their release from prison would form a key part of the new bill. </body>

      <body>It is a source of "national shame" that as many as 800,000 people in England are "chronically lonely", Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. In a speech, Mr Hunt highlighted the "problem of loneliness that in our busy lives we have utterly failed to confront as a society". "Some five million people say television is their main form of company," he said. Labour accused of him trying to blame families for government failures. In a speech at the National Children and Adults Services (NCAS) conference, Mr Hunt said: "Each and every lonely person has someone who could visit them and offer companionship. "A forgotten million who live amongst us - ignored to our national shame." He added: "According to the Campaign to End Loneliness, there are 800,000 people in England who are chronically lonely." He also told delegates that the 112,000 cases of alleged abuse in care homes referred by English councils in 2012-13, the majority involving over-65s, indicated that "something is badly wrong". But the regulation of care in both the private and public sector was improving, he argued. The Conservative MP said the new chief inspector of social care, Andrea Sutcliffe, would start to give ratings to care homes from April 2014, with a view to organising inspections of all 25,000 care homes by 2016. Mr Hunt said he was "particularly worried" about the 400,000 people in care homes - some of whom get regular visits, but others who were just "parked there". He said that 46% of people aged 80 or over reported feeling lonely "some of the time or often". He warned that loneliness was as "bad for you" as "smoking 15 cigarettes a day", was "worse than obesity" because of the risk of blood clots, heart disease and dementia, and warned that lonely people "drink more" and are more prone to early admission in residential or nursing care. Mr Hunt also said he believed the UK should learn from Asian cultures, where there was "reverence and respect for older people" and "residential care is a last rather than a first option". "The social contract is stronger because as children see how their own grandparents are looked after, they develop higher expectations of how they too will be treated when they get old," he explained. "If we are to tackle the challenge of an ageing society, we must learn from this - and restore and reinvigorate the social contract between generations. "And uncomfortable though it is to say it, it will only start with changes in the way we personally treat our own parents and grandparents." England should aim to become "the best place in the world to grow old in", he concluded. But Labour said the "real national shame" was "Jeremy Hunt's attempt to shift the blame for dealing with the very real problems of loneliness amongst elderly people on to families alone". Shadow health and social care minister Liz Kendall said: "He seems completely unaware that there are over six million unpaid family carers in Britain today, one in five of whom provide more than 50 hours care a week for their loved ones. "These unsung heroes save the taxpayer billions of pounds yet often get precious little support in return. "Families, friends and neighbours need a decent care system to back up their efforts to look after elderly people, but the reality is our care system is in crisis and has been pushed to the brink of collapse. "Jeremy Hunt and David Cameron need to take responsibly for their government's actions rather than trying to turn the clock back and say it's down to families alone." Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said on Twitter that Jeremy Hunt was "right to highlight isolation of older people". He added: "But he can't get away from fact that Govt cuts to care have made it much worse." But speaking on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Anthea Tinker, professor of social gerontology at King's College in London, said it was a "myth" that eastern Asian families placed greater reverence on families and older people than in the West. "The reality is that with one-child-families, children have often moved to a city or emigrated," she said. "So it's just not practical for families to depend on their children. One of the largest nursing homes in the world is about to open in China, for 5,000 people, which is amazing." Prof Tinker added: "We've got to look at the reality rather than the myth." </body>

      <description>Probation officers in England and Wales vote overwhelmingly to strike over the government's privatisation plans.</description>

      <body>Probation officers in England and Wales have voted to strike over government privatisation plans. Private firms and charities are currently bidding for contracts worth £450m to supervise 225,000 low and medium-risk offenders each year. The probation officers' union, Napo, said there had been a 46% turn-out, with more than 80% voting yes for action. No date has been given. It warned selling off the Probation Service would boost re-offending rates. The government called the vote "disappointing" and said it would continue to engage with unions. Under the proposals, most of the Probation Service's work will be done under new payment-by-results contracts, to be awarded in 20 English regions. The whole of Wales will be one region. The contracts would mean that low and medium-risk offenders will be supervised by a mix of private firms, charities and voluntary groups. More than 700 organisations from around the world, as well as hundreds of British firms, have expressed interest in the contracts, the Ministry of Justice has said. A new public sector body, the National Probation Service, will be created to deal with the rehabilitation of 31,000 high-risk offenders each year. Napo general secretary Ian Lawrence said his organisation would pursue the mandate for industrial action "with vigour" but would also seek "to avoid this if possible by way of further negotiations with ministers". He said "decimating the award-winning public sector Probation Service and selling it off to the likes of G4S and Serco will result in increased re-offending rates, a lack of continuity in risk management, and will see the privateers making huge profits at the expense of victims, offenders and taxpayers." Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said news of the strike was "disappointing" but stressed there were "well-established contingency arrangements". "More than 600,000 offences were committed last year by those who had broken the law before, despite spending £4bn a year on prisons and probation," he said. "The public deserves better and we are committed to introducing our important reforms, which were widely consulted on. "We will continue to support staff and engage with unions as our reforms move forwards." Max Chambers, head of crime and justice at the right-leaning think-tank Policy Exchange, said industrial action was not the way forward and called for the Probation Service to "get on board" with the changes. "It's no surprise that some probation staff are worried about the future, but striking is not a very clever move and could put the public at risk," he said. "There are huge opportunities that payment-by-results can offer staff, including greater professional discretion, more freedom to innovate and the chance to have a stake in their own mutual organisations." A government-wide review of all contracts held by G4S and Serco is being conducted after it emerged the firms had overcharged the government by "tens of millions" for electronic tags for criminals. Serco has said it is "co-operating fully". G4S has said it "co-operated fully" with a previous audit started earlier this year and was conducting its own inquiry but was not aware of any indications of dishonesty or misconduct. The two firms will not be awarded any contracts until the government audit is completed, but Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has allowed them to bid for the probation service. </body>

      <title>Litigation 'could paralyse' military</title>
      <description>A "sustained legal assault" on British forces could have "catastrophic consequences" for the safety of the nation, an influential think tank warns.</description>

      <body>A "sustained legal assault" on British forces could have "catastrophic consequences" for the safety of the nation, an influential right-leaning think tank has warned. A report for Policy Exchange says legal action may paralyse the armed forces. It also says the cost of litigation against the Ministry of Defence is up, with £130m going towards it in 2012-13. Lawyers for the families of service personnel have dismissed the findings as "political" and "biased". Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said he remained "concerned about the challenge to combat immunity arising from recent court judgment". Entitled The Fog of Law, the report points to the application of the Human Rights Act and the growing application of civilian norms to military conduct via the courts as risks to the UK's armed forces. It says the MoD has earmarked a total of £130m for litigation - including 5,827 legal cases - in 2012-13; under £70m was spent on legal action in 2008-9. As part of this, the MoD now employs around 310 lawyers and legal consultants at a cost of £36m a year, the report says. Its authors are Territorial Army Lieutenant Colonel and strategy consultant Tom Tugendhat, and retired US Army Lieutenant Colonel Laura Croft, who served in Iraq and also as a lawyer. They say the main "weapon" used in the legal challenge is the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Although the ECHR had applied since September 1953, the Human Rights Act (HRA) in 1998 gave individuals the ability to appeal directly to domestic courts. This, combined with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, saw a rise in actions brought through the courts. In the past, those serving in the military were protected from prosecution under Combat Immunity, while the Law of Armed Conflict regulated the conduct of war. But recent judicial findings have extended common law claims of negligence and civil claims of duty of care to the combat zone, and the authors claim this is already affecting the combat capability of the services. They cite cases such as that of Ahmed al-Fartoosi, the leader of the radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's militia, who is in the process of suing the British government for compensation. He alleges abuse during his captivity in Basra, and claims that he was denied his rights under the ECHR. Other claims include that of Ali Al Jedda v the UK (2011). The claimant was arrested travelling from London to Iraq in 2003 on suspicion of being a member of a terrorist group involved in weapons smuggling and explosive attacks in Iraq. He sued the government under Article 5 of the Human Rights Act, a decision rejected by the UK Supreme Court but overturned by the ECHR. The Supreme Court ruled this year that British troops remain within the UK's jurisdiction and so fall under the Human Rights Act, even when deployed on active service abroad. This has led to cases in which relatives of British soldiers have sued the MoD under human rights law. The report's authors warn that "legal creep" could pose a "mortal threat to the culture and ethos of the military which cannot be easily reversed." They say that the extension of law risks "catastrophically weakening the UK". They insist it may not be long before a foreign power or even insurgent forces begin to sponsor legal actions as a way of paralysing UK forces through legal process. The report adds that claims involving human rights law are increasingly costly, with the MoD estimating that such cases will cost a total of £57m in 2012-13. The most common cases not involving human rights law brought against the MoD last year related to noise-induced hearing loss and cost £51.3m altogether. Lt Col Tugendhat told the BBC that military personnel should not be above the law. But he added: "As the ultimate guarantors of a nation's liberty they have agreed, voluntarily, to surrender or limit many of their own rights. Without this, the nation would be undefended." The report recommends that: But lawyers for Sue Smith, whose son was killed in a Snatch Land Rover in Iraq in August 2007, criticised Policy Exchange's conclusions. Jocelyn Cockburn of Hodge Jones and Allen said: "Wives or mothers such as Sue Smith come to me not because they wanted compensation money, but to campaign against the use of Snatch Land Rovers in Iraq because they wanted to protect other soldiers, and improve the safety of servicemen and women abroad. "It's very important to have independent scrutiny of decisions made by the MoD. War is risky, and therefore you have an obligation to reduce risk and mitigate the threat." Mr Hammond welcomed the report as a "timely contribution to the debate about the appropriate balance between legal protections and freedom of decision-making by commanders in the field". But he added: "It cannot be right that troops on operations have to put the European Convention on Human Rights ahead of what is operationally vital to protect our national security." </body>

      <title>Bid for fuel discount in rural towns</title>
      <description>A fuel discount that applies to the Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly could be extended to remote and rural parts of the UK mainland.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24575066</url>
      <date>1382095865</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70551000/jpg/_70551213_fuelafp.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>A fuel discount scheme in the Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly could be extended to 10 rural communities in mainland Scotland and England. The UK has applied to the European Commission (EC) for a 5p a litre reduction in fuel duty in those places. They are Acharacle, Achnasheen, Appin, Carrbridge, Dalwhinnie, Gairloch and Strathpeffer. Kirkby-in-Furness in Cumbria, Hawes in North Yorkshire and Lynton in Devon are also included. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said that, as a Highlander, he knew "all too well that fuel prices tend to be highest in areas where a car is needed the most". "We've already delivered a tax cut for remote islands and now want to extend that to mainland rural areas that suffer from similarly high prices to the islands," he added. "We have put together the strongest possible evidence base to try and maximise the places that get it." A decision from the EC is expected next year. "As I've said before, it won't be easy to get this agreed with the commission, but I will do everything I can to make this happen," Mr Alexander said. The 10 locations selected for the application have higher pump prices than in areas that already receive discount, are more than 100 miles by road from the nearest refinery and have a population density lower than 135 people per square km. Pete Williams, RAC head of external affairs, said the application was "good news" because many people in rural communities were "unfairly penalised by high fuel prices as they rely on their cars for work and day-to-day life". "It's also understandable that fuel retailers in these remote areas are selling petrol and diesel at higher prices due to increased distribution costs from being so far from refineries," he added. "Let's hope the European Commission will see the sense in easing the pain for these rural towns when they come to make their decision next year." Labour Treasury spokeswoman Catherine McKinnell said she hoped the announcement would bring relief for drivers in the selected areas. But she added: "Eight out of 10 of these areas have Liberal Democrat MPs - including two in Danny Alexander's own constituency. The public will want to be reassured this is no more than a coincidence because nobody will thank a Lib Dem Treasury minister who refuses to tackle the cost-of-living crisis everywhere but his own back yard." Mr Alexander told BBC Breakfast it was "total nonsense" to suggest the plans were designed to favour seats held by his party. The idea had been put forward by his party in its election manifesto, he said, but the locations had been chosen "according to a strict selection criteria". He said it "would be nice to have a longer list" but the 10 communities chosen had a "reasonable chance of being agreed". Introduced in March 2012, the discount currently applies to the Hebrides, Northern Isles, islands in the Clyde and the Isles of Scilly as well as other island communities in Europe. Retailers register with HM Revenue and Customs to claim 5p a litre relief on fuel for sale to the public. </body>

      <title>Osborne agrees to China nuclear deal</title>
      <description>The Chancellor, George Osborne, announces that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.</description>

      <body>The Chancellor, George Osborne, has announced that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. The announcement also said that Chinese firms might eventually be allowed to take majority stakes in British nuclear plants. Mr Osborne made the announcement on the last day of a trade visit to China. The first China deal could be as early as next week, with the go ahead for a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site. Also on Thursday, a report commissioned for the prime minister warned of a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years. The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits". Supply is expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15. Most existing coal-fired plants are expected to be closed in 2015 to meet European Union pollution directives, while many gas-fired power plants are not being used at the moment because gas is so expensive. These would take time and money to bring back on stream. The Hinkley C project, in Somerset, will be the first new nuclear power station since 1995. Hinkley C's construction will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EDF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs. EDF has been negotiating with three Chinese nuclear giants on the Hinkley C project - CGN, CNNC and SNPTC - all of which have been seen by the chancellor this week. Our business editor, Robert Peston, says he has been told that one or two of these will end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C. A DECC spokesperson said talks about a contract were underway: "Negotiations remain ongoing between the government and EDF on the potential terms of an investment contract for Hinkley Point C. No agreement has as yet been reached. "A contract will only be offered if it is value for money, fair and affordable, in line with government policy on no public subsidy for new nuclear and consistent with state-aid rules." Mr Osborne made the announcement while on a visit to the Taishan nuclear plant in southern China on Thursday which is itself a collaboration between EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG). He said: "Today is another demonstration of the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China, the world's oldest civil nuclear power and the world's fastest growing civil nuclear power." The memorandum of understanding also includes roles for British companies in China's nuclear programme. China has 17 nuclear reactors in operation, which provide about 1% of its electricity production capacity. In the future, Chinese firms might be allowed more than just minority stakes in UK plants. The government said that "over time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes". At the weekend, the Energy Minister, Ed Davey, said he believed that a "massive" wave of investment from China, Japan and Korea would secure UK's power supply into the future. Securing future energy supplies is a major challenge. A portion of energy bills is being diverted to alternative energy investment in wind farms and solar energy. But the government believes that renewable energy sources cannot provide enough power for the country's energy needs. The industry regulator, Ofgem, has also warned of the "unprecedented challenge" to secure power supplies. It said spare electricity power production capacity could fall to 2% by 2015, increasing the risk of blackouts. </body>

      <title>Work 'may be no way out of poverty'</title>
      <description>Working parents in Britain no longer earn enough to "escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn warns in his first report.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24553611</url>

      <body>Working parents in Britain "simply do not earn enough to escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn has warned. Two-thirds of poor children are now from families where an adult works, his report found. Many low and middle-income children face being "worse off" than their parents because of falling earnings and rising prices, Mr Milburn added. Wealthier pensioners' benefits should be cut and minimum pay raised, he said. The former Labour health secretary suggested some benefits currently protected from cuts - such as free TV licences and winter fuel allowances for pensioners - could be means tested in order to share the burden of austerity more fairly. But a spokesman for David Cameron said: "The prime minister believes it is right to make commitments to pensioners in relationship to state provision." The government has pledged to safeguard such benefits until the next general election. In its first report, the government's Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission warned the target of ending child poverty by 2020 would "in all likelihood be missed by a considerable margin" - leaving as many as two million children in poverty. Poverty is defined as having a household income that is less than 60% of the national median income. The latest government figures on poverty, released in June, show the median UK household income for 2011/2012 was £427 a week - 60% of that figure was £256 a week. In that year, 17% of children, or 2.3 million, were classed as being in poverty while 15% of working-age adults, or 5.6 million, were in poverty. For pensioners, meanwhile, that figures was 16% - or 1.9 million. The report said Britain still had "high levels of child poverty and low levels of social mobility" with a rising number of children in "absolute poverty" coming from working families. Two thirds of children officially deemed as being poor now came from a family where at least one parent was working - and in three out of four of those cases, at least one of their parents was working full time, the report found. It also said the "twin problems of high youth unemployment and falling living standards" were storing up problems for the future. Among its key recommendations the report urged the government to: "Just as the UK government has focused on reducing the country's financial deficit it now needs to redouble its efforts to reduce our country's fairness deficit," the report said. Single mother Judith Healy, who works from home as a telemarketer, said that, while her wages had not gone up, her expenses had continued to increase. She said she was worried about paying energy bills this winter. "We didn't ask to get in this situation, we are doing the best that we can in the circumstances that we have and that's really what it's about - it's survival now," she told BBC News. Mr Milburn told the BBC: "Today child poverty is a problem for working families rather than the workless or the work-shy." Around five million people in the country, mainly women, were earning less than the living wage, which is about £7.45 an hour outside of London, he said. "These are the people frankly who do all the right things, they go out to work, they stand on their own two feet, they look after their families - they're the strivers not the shirkers - and yet they're all too often the forgotten people of Britain and I think they desperately need a new deal." Mr Milburn said that while ministers and employers could do more, it was unrealistic to expect the government to continue topping up low pay using working tax credits. He advocated a scheme for pairing bright children with the best teachers in an effort to raise attainment. Mr Milburn has previously said social mobility - the idea that individuals can better themselves in terms of educational opportunity, job prospects and salaries from one generation to the next - is "flat-lining". Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg welcomed the report, but warned that "punishing pensioners isn't going to help a single child achieve more in life". Enver Solomon, of the National Children's Bureau charity, said the report was "a wake-up call for all political parties by stating that our country is dramatically polarised between the haves and have- nots". "As the commission states, there is an urgent need to rebalance the distribution of resources so that the burden of austerity is more equally shared," he said. Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said the "powerful report" showed "ordinary families' living standards [were being] squeezed and social divisions [were] deepening as a result of this government's decisions to put a privileged few first". On Wednesday, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed the number of unemployed people in the UK fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million in the June-August period. </body>

      <body>Gloria de Piero, the shadow minister for women and equalities, has accused a news agency of trying to obtain topless pictures of her taken when she was 15. In a blog post, the Labour MP said the agency claimed to be acting on behalf of a national newspaper and was offering thousands of pounds to people who might have copies of the pictures. She would find it "humiliating" if they were published, she told the BBC. She had grown up in poverty and had posed topless for the money, she added. "It's part of me, it's part of my life, it's part of my story," she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. "I've got an amazing mum and dad, but after the age of about 10, no-one worked in my household due to my father's ill health. "My parents had jobs, they never had careers, and they were very, very ambitious for their daughter to have a better life than them." The Ashfield MP said she had played truant on days when pupils were able to wear their own clothes, because she was ashamed of her wardrobe. "I wanted some money, like my friends," she said of her decision to pose topless. "There are reasons why I thought that they might be a way out for me, but I would respectfully say that I hope they are not published. "I would find it embarrassing, humiliating." The existence of the pictures "says something about poverty, growing up in poverty", she added. "I'm not going to be a victim here," she said, adding that she did not want to see politics full of people "who, at 15, are thinking 'Ooh, I might be a politician one day'". "Goodness, if someone had suggested that to me, at 15, I'd have thought they were absolutely barking." In her blog, she elaborated: "I don't think anyone wants politics to be open only to those people who were planning their political careers in their teens. I would like to see a politics that represents our country, including many more women from all walks of life, and that is something I am passionately committed to help bring about. "No one should have to worry that something they did when they were young might prevent them from serving their community or getting involved in politics at a local or national level." Ms de Piero concluded: "It is now time to call off the hunt for these pictures and let me get on with the job I was elected to do, representing the people of Ashfield and serving in the shadow cabinet." </body>

      <body>Management and unions at the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical plant have failed to reach a deal which would see the site fired up again. Operators Ineos asked the Unite union to make a commitment to call no further industrial action this year. Unite said it would agree to this, but on the condition that Ineos would not impose its planned cuts on the workforce during the same period. The two sides held a face-to-face meeting at the plant earlier. Ineos said it would have restarted operations at the site on Friday if Unite had given the company a "no conditions, no strings attached" assurance of no further industrial action this year. However, it claimed the union had refused that offer. Calum MacLean, Ineos Grangemouth (UK) chairman, said: "Unite's response is unbelievable given how much effort has been put into securing this deal with ourselves, the Scottish and the UK governments all working hard to find a way forward. "We will now concentrate on discussing the Survival Plan with our staff during the 60-day consultation". Unite said it had already promised no strike action before Christmas but the union repeated its calls for Ineos to abandon proposed changes to staff contracts. Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scottish secretary, said: "At Acas talks earlier this week, Unite committed to conducting no industrial action ballots or industrial action before 31 December 2013. "This was on the basis that the company would not impose cuts on the workforce during the same period. Unite also proposed that these negotiations over the future of the site during this period would be held under the auspices of Acas." He added: "If the company lifts the cuts agenda that it is imposing on its workers, then our offer still stands." Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond earlier warned of a risk to the future of Grangemouth if the current stand-off continues. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, he said the longer site remained "idle and cold" the more difficult things would become. Mr Salmond met with Ineos and Unite representatives on Thursday. Ineos said shutting down the Grangemouth complex had cost the company £20m so far. The firm had put proposals over pay and pensions to workers at the complex, which has 1,400 employees and many more contractors. A letter outlining the proposed changes - which includes freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016 - was being couriered to employees on Friday. Unite claimed the company had told staff they could lose their jobs and be reemployed on poorer terms unless they agreed to give up their final salary pension, and accept pay freezes and pay cuts, by 18:00 on Monday. The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans. </body>

      <title>Flood board 'risked lives' fear</title>
      <description>The lives and homes of thousands of people could have been put at risk because of poor management at a public body, a committee of AMs warns.</description>

      <body>The lives and homes of thousands of people could have been put at risk because of poor management at a public body, a committee of AMs has warned. The Caldicot and Wentlooge Internal Drainage Board is responsible for ensuring the Gwent Levels do not flood. The latest criticism follows a Wales Audit Office (WAO) report which said the board misused public funds. AMs said the findings did not reflect on the board's managers now. Its powers are likely to be transferred elsewhere. The Welsh government said it understands appropriate control measures are now in place at the board. The body, which is independent of government, manages drainage systems in an area of low-lying coastal land between Cardiff and Chepstow, south of the M4 and bordered by the Severn estuary. The WAO investigation into the board's 2010/11 accounts found irregularities in the way some senior staff had awarded themselves and others pay rises. It also had evidence that the board went on trips around Europe with "little or no" business case to justify their need. It said that in 2005, 37 people went on a £4,333 three-day inspection visit to Venice, including 13 staff and board members and 21 guests, mainly spouses or relatives. Another excursion to Northern Ireland for 28 people in 2008, which included a visit to a distillery and the Giants Causeway, cost more than £4,700. The Welsh assembly's public accounts committee said events at Caldicot and Wentlooge were "a prime example of how not to run a publicly-funded organisation". In a new report, committee chair Darren Millar AM said: "There were no clear lines of accountability for the board and it was not effectively monitored in developing and implementing a strategic plan for flood-risk management in the Gwent Levels. "We believe that this potentially put the lives and property of thousands of people at risk." The committee report concluded that "poor governance and accountability" led to staffing disputes and infighting at the drainage board. Mr Millar said: "Caldicot and Wentlooge IDB is responsible for managing the appropriate drainage for a strategically critical area of Wales, which encompasses major infrastructure, businesses, farmland and tens of thousands of homes. "The committee believes that the poor governance, accountability and transparency at the board had the potential to put all of that at risk." He also warned that the committee was concerned that the issues at the board may not be unique and urged Welsh ministers to remind other public bodies of their responsibilities. But Mr Millar said the board had taken action to address many of the issues highlighted by the WAO and the report's findings did not reflect on the current management team. There are three internal drainage boards currently operating wholly or mainly in Wales: Caldicot and Wentlooge Levels, which is wholly in Wales; Lower Wye, which is mainly in Wales and partly in England; and Powysland, which is also mainly in Wales and partly in England. Natural Resources Minister Alun Davies said he was now considering merging all three boards with environmental body Natural Resources Wales. In a statement to AMs, he said the issues raised about Caldicot and Wentlooge board do not "reflect the culture or standards of public service that we have a right to expect from any public body". "It is clear from the report that it lacked some of the necessary governance controls, checks and balances that a public body must possess," Mr Davies said "We have already consulted on the future of these bodies and in the consultation we made clear that our preferred option was to transfer the powers of the internal drainage boards to Natural Resources Wales. "I have considered responses to the consultation and have asked officials to look at the costs, benefits and risks of a transfer to Natural Resources Wales, alongside other options. "This work is well advanced, and I expect to announce my decision on the future of these boards in the next month." </body>

      <title>VIDEO: Food scandal 'could happen again'</title>
      <description>With cuts to food inspection and reports of increasing fraud, can the public be confident the food we eat is what we think it is?</description>

      <body>With cuts to front line inspectors and reports of increasing food fraud, can the public be confident about food standards following the recent horse meat scandal? Food writer Jay Rayner investigates how well food producers and retailers have responded and visits Tesco's laboratories in Wolverhampton to see what the retailer is doing to improve testing. But the industry is vast and the system of keeping it under control is complex. A new report by the National Audit Office has found the public's expectations about the authenticity of food are not being matched by the effectiveness of controls in place. Andy Foster from the Trading Standards Institute says the inspection system is "creaking" and in his view "the horse meat scandal could happen again". The Food Standards Agency says the current financial environment is challenging but it has invested considerably more in the last year to boost efforts and resources to detect problems. Inside Out is broadcast on BBC One England on Monday, 14 October at 19:30 BST and nationwide on the iPlayer for seven days thereafter. </body>

      <title>What became of the 'Geordie mafia'?</title>
      <description>North East MPs used to dominate the front benches in the Blair years, but not any longer. Why and does it matter?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24483810</url>
      <date>1381476278</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70409000/jpg/_70409400_70408752.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>There was a time when some said the UK government was run by a "Geordie mafia". And Tony Blair's cabinets were certainly dominated by politicians based in the North East constituencies close to his Sedgefield seat. There was Peter Mandelson, Alan Milburn, Jack Cunningham, Stephen Byers, Nick Brown, Mo Mowlam, Hilary Armstrong and latterly David Miliband. Now though, not a single government minister represents a North East constituency. The reshuffle of the government hasn't changed that. William Hague comes closest as his Richmond seat constituency is next to Sedgefield over the North Yorkshire border. Scarborough and Whitby MP Robert Goodwill was also promoted to become a transport minister in the shake-up, but otherwise northerners are thin on the ground. Perhaps that's not surprising, given that the North East isn't a power base for either the Conservatives or the Liberal Democrats. But then the shadow cabinet is also devoid of any North East MPs. There are plenty - 13 if you include Cumbria's Jamie Reed - lurking in the junior ranks, but none of them have yet broken into the top team. Part of this may be a result of the demise of that New Labour North East generation. The region saw a big turnover of MPs in 2010 as many of the more established names chose to stand down. It may then need more time for the next generation of North East Labour to make it into the shadow cabinet. Newcastle Central's Chi Onwurah has already been tipped by website Labour List as shadow cabinet material. Her neighbour, Catherine McKinnell (Newcastle North) also occupies a key role in the Labour treasury team. Others are clearly on the rise too. Sunderland Central's Julie Elliott was brought into the shadow energy and climate change line-up in the reshuffle, while Houghton and Sunderland South's Bridget Phillipson is taking her first step on the ladder by being appointed as a whip. Then there are those who are now well-established in the shadow teams - Helen Goodman (Bishop Auckland) in culture, Jamie Reed (Copeland) in health, Kevan Jones (Durham North) in defence, Iain Wright (Hartlepool) in business, Roberta Blackman-Woods (City of Durham) in communities and local government and Sharon Hodgson (Washington and Sunderland West), formerly in education, now in women and equalities. But the question is does it matter that the North East doesn't have MPs on the front benches? Many of the current generation are making an impact in other ways. Stockton South MP Conservative James Wharton's push for a European referendum has got him plenty of headlines, and if his bill eventually does trigger a vote, he might have played a part in one of the biggest political moments of our times. Hexham's Guy Opperman has also had more freedom to say what he thinks because so far he has not become a minister. He's spoken out against regional pay, in favour of the living wage and campaigned for fuel duty cuts. He's written a radical book on prison reform. All areas he might have had to steer clear of with a government role. On the opposition benches, Labour's Grahame Morris has led recent debate in parliament on the gun laws following the shooting of three of his Easington constituents. Others on both sides have also played a part in the parliamentary committees that are increasingly influential. Redcar Lib Dem Ian Swales has been helping to question BBC managers on executive severance pay on the public accounts committee. Labour's Alex Cunningham (Stockton North), Pat Glass (Durham North West), and Ian Mearns (Gateshead) have had a chance to hold Michael Gove to account on the education committee. And then all of the area's MPs have more time to dedicate to constituency matters than the likes of Blair and Miliband probably did. Conservatives in the North East have also pointed to the fact that the north-south divide remained stubbornly in place despite a 10-year period of government led by a PM from the North East. But others do still believe the region needs a place at the top table. Newcastle East's Nick Brown - the last remaining member of that North East 'mafia' in parliament - has campaigned for the region to have its own minister. He believes it is essential that someone is championing the region's cause at the heart of government. The government believes that's unnecessary, but there's no question it is now keen to promote northern MPs. The problem is, until the Conservatives and Lib Dems win more seats in the north, there are still too few candidates to choose from. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Beginner's guide to PM's speech</title>
      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant? What has happened? Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning. Why the big deal about the speech? Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech. So what did Cameron say? Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech. What sorts of powers does the UK want back? The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK." Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders? The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK. So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU? David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market." What has been the reaction in the UK? Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement. Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party. The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts. What about the reaction around Europe? The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction. What about the reaction from business? A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".

      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle. The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011. As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign. Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury. Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011. Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development. Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. The MP for Leeds West was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament. A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader. As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest. One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress. Moving to defence from shadow Northern Ireland secretary in October 2013, the MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted having smoked cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip. The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011. One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the Cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. She supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leader of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. Chris Leslie has been appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the latest Labour frontbench reshuffle. The former Bradford councillor was elected MP for Shipley - a Tory stronghold in Yorkshire - in 1997. He held several junior positions in the former Labour government within the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He lost his Shipley seat in 2005, but re-entered Parliament in 2010 as MP for Nottingham East. He went on to serve as shadow financial secretary to the Treasury on Labour's front bench in the Commons. Mary Creagh has moved from shadow environment secretary to shadow transport secretary in October 2013. When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest. Maria Eagle moved in October 2013 to shadow environment secretary in a job swap with Mary Creagh. She is the sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. She held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player. Jim Murphy was moved - demoted in many people's eyes - in October 2013 from shadow defence secretary. He is a Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign. He has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football. Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008. In Holyrood, she held various posts, including minister for communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws. Before entering politics she was a lecturer in community education. The then 52-year-old took up her first full shadow cabinet role in October 2011. Jon Trickett takes over from the departing Tom Watson as deputy Labour party chair. Gordon Brown's former parliamentary aide, Mr Trickett previously attended shadow cabinet as a junior minister and became a full member as shadow Cabinet Office minister in Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle. The then 61-year-old MP for Hemsworth took over the role from Tessa Jowell. Michael Dugher became shadow Cabinet Office minister in October 2013 after attending the shadow cabinet as shadow minister without portfolio. Mr Dugher won the seat of Barnsley East at the 2010 General Election, after serving as chief political spokesman for the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Having joined the ranks of the Labour parliamentary party, he then became a parliamentary private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband. He is also currently vice-chairman of the Labour Party. Gloria De Piero was appointed shadow women and equalities minister in the October 2013 reshuffle. The former GMTV political editor was an political admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as party leader. She was elected as MP for Ashfield at the 2010 General Election and appointed to a junior role in the shadow Department for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport. Since October 2011, Ms De Piero has served as a junior shadow Home Office minister. Former BBC radio producer and special adviser who has risen quickly through the ranks. The then 40-year-old was elected in 2010 for Pontypridd, but previously stood unsuccessfully in the 2006 Blaenau Gwent by-election where he lost to independent Dai Davies. He supported Ed Miliband for the leadership and was given a role in his shadow team five months after entering the House, first as shadow Wales minister and then in the shadow Treasury team. This is his first shadow cabinet role. Moving from shadow minister for international development in October 2013, former charity worker and chief executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation, Mr Lewis held a string of junior ministerial posts in the Labour government after becoming an MP in 1997 at the age of 31. He started out as a parliamentary private secretary to then Trade Secretary Stephen Byers, before going on to be an education minister, Treasury minister, health minister and international development minister. Most recently, he was minister of state at the Foreign Office. His previous shadow cabinet role was as culture spokesman in which he was a vocal campaigner on phone hacking. The then 52-year-old was elected unopposed in a ballot for chief whip in 2010. A former local government minister, the Doncaster Central MP is responsible for maintaining discipline among Labour MPs in crucial Commons votes. Continues to lead her party in the Lords, having done the job, while in government, under Gordon Brown. She is also a spokesman on education, work and pensions, Northern Ireland and equality issues. Born in 1955, she started her political career as a special adviser to Neil - now Lord - Kinnock in the 1980s. A long-serving leader of Brighton and Hove Council, Lord Bassam was given a peerage in 1997 at the age of 44.

      <body>This week at Westminster has been dominated by one topic: energy prices. It is a case study of the biggest theme in politics at the moment, the cost of living. With British Gas joining energy provider SSE in hiking its prices, what are people feeling the squeeze and fearing the cold supposed to do? Enter, stage left, the humble jumper. And welcome to a brief snapshot of how headlines sometimes appear despite what might have emerged out of the lips of politicians and their advisers. Energy Secretary Ed Davey spent much of Thursday touring TV and radio studios criticising British Gas and suggesting people should shop around for the best energy deal. In an interview on the BBC's Newsnight, he was asked about what happened in the Davey household. Did Mr Davey, presenter Jeremy Paxman asked, wear a jumper? "I am sure people do wear jumpers, I wear jumpers at home, but you are missing the point here Jeremy, we do need to help people with their bills, I am extremely worried about them, we can use competition the way we have, we can make our homes warmer and use less electricity and gas by going more energy efficient," said Mr Davey. Cue headlines suggesting the energy secretary said wear a jumper. Great story. Except he didn't say this. Mr Davey was asked about jumpers. Mr Davey mentioned jumpers. But Mr Davey didn't say you or I should wear a jumper. Fast forward 12 hours to Friday's briefing for Westminster journalists, which is conducted by one of the prime minister's official spokesmen. The Daily Mirror - which is no fan of the coalition government - chased this theme with some vigour. The clear aim of the questions was to attempt to get an answer along the lines of "the prime minister tells you to wear jumper". If he'd said that, I'd have been jumping at the chance to get on the television, radio and online to tell it. But he didn't. Here is the exchange, as I scribbled it in my notebook: Reporter: "Does the prime minister wear a jumper at home?" Official Spokesman: "The prime minister doesn't tend to give fashion tips." Several further questions along the same lines came along, which didn't get very far. The spokesman was then asked about what the PM thought of charities giving advice that perhaps people should consider wrapping up warm. Here was the response: "Clearly, he is not going to prescribe necessarily the actions individuals should take about that. But if people are giving that advice, that is something that people may wish to consider." Next came the headlines claiming the prime minister was suggesting people should wear a jumper. Great story. Except the spokesman did not say this. Labour leapt at the chance to have their say, claiming Downing Street was in chaos and offering Ed Miliband for interview. Downing Street then issued a statement: "To be clear, it is entirely false to suggest the Prime Minister would advise people they should wear jumpers to stay warm. Any suggestion to the contrary is mischief-making." And so concludes the story of a story which isn't really a story at all. </body>

      <title>London Mayor Boris Johnson sparks Chinese interest</title>
      <description>Boris Johnson wins Chinese fans on six-day tour</description>

      <body>Boris Johnson rode a rental bicycle through crowds of admirers, travelled on the Beijing subway and made a speech which mentioned Harry Potter, Downton Abbey and James Bond. Along the way, the mayor of London managed to impress legions of young fans in China. Mr Johnson is wrapping up a six-day tour of China, which is happening at the same time as a trade mission headed by UK Chancellor George Osborne. Mr Johnson appears to be the more popular of the two politicians in China. The mayor's visit sparked thousands of comments on Weibo, China's version of Twitter. Few posted similar remarks about Mr Osborne, the mayor's Conservative Party rival. "[Mr Johnson] is a little bit special," says 19-year-old Song Yige, a second year law student at Peking University, who was in the audience to watch speeches by both men. "Politicians in China, they're like the chancellor. They're very calm and composed. But the mayor, he is very humorous. He is not distant like other politicians." Weibo users were slightly less reserved in their admiration of Mr Johnson. "I like your fluffy hair," one user wrote in English. "If you get bald someday in the future, will you put a wig? What colour will you like to choose?" "I simply want to know how to move to London without breaking any law? PS: I am poor!!! PPS: we all love you!! XOXO!" wrote another. The mayor's Beijing subway ride was particularly impressive, Ms Song says. "It's like some fresh air to China because we have never seen that before." Chinese leaders have been criticised in the past for their reluctance to use public transport, preferring instead to travel in chauffeur-driven cars. However, China's leaders are starting to use the same populist approaches as Boris Johnson, says Wang Zhanpeng, director of the British Studies Centre at the Beijing Foreign Studies University. "Chinese leaders weren't doing things like this as much in the past, but now there are some changes," Mr Wang says. "There are also more cases of leaders demonstrating their man-of-the-people approach and their personalities, although our leaders would do it more often on occasions like disaster relief." Sina, a top Chinese web portal, hosted a web page this week titled "Ask Boris Johnson", in which the mayor answered questions on his love of bicycling and expected upgrades to London's underground system. Most comments and questions asked Mr Johnson for his experience running a city like London, asking for tips on how he might improve vast Chinese cities like Beijing. "Our nation's officials, please learn from others," one Weibo user said. </body>

      <title>Is it a good idea to allow China a stake in UK nuclear?</title>
      <description>Is the UK getting too close to China with latest power deal?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24563535</url>

      <body>The UK is to allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. Is this a good idea? It is 57 years to the day since the Queen threw a lever to start electricity flowing from the world's first civil nuclear power plant, at Calder Hall, in Cumbria. If you had told any of the dignitaries present that day that Britain would one day surrender control of its nuclear industry to foreign powers, losing in the process the ability to build its own reactors, they would have thought you were mad. But we have long got used to the idea that Britain is no longer an industrial powerhouse. So why should we be concerned that China, a former Cold War enemy, has been given the go-ahead to invest in new nuclear plants? The economics are simple enough. The government believes it needs new nuclear power plants to keep the lights on. But it has ruled out public subsidies, so badly needs private investment. "We need to see investment not just from China but from Japan, the US, France and the City of London," said Energy Secretary Ed Davey, an architect of the deal between French energy giant EDF and China General Nuclear Power Group. The deal is initially confined to a 30% stake in a single new plant, at Hinckley Point, which will be built using French and Japanese technology. But it could lead to Chinese companies taking majority stakes in future projects, and will see Chinese technicians being trained by British nuclear scientists. It is being hailed by Chancellor George Osborne as a triumph of British diplomacy, potentially opening up China's rapidly expanding nuclear energy market to British companies and keeping energy bills down for British consumers. But not everyone is quite so ecstatic. "With continuing concerns about Chinese cyber-attacks on foreign governments' computer systems, should we really be inviting companies which many believe to be effectively arms of the Chinese government into our critical infrastructure at all?," writes Stuart Nathan, in trade magazine The Engineer, calling the deal "inexplicable". In a recent Financial Times blog, former Downing Street energy policy adviser Nick Butler summed up the concerns: "They will be inside the system, with access to the intricate architecture of the UK's National Grid and the processes through which electricity supply is controlled, as well as to the UK's nuclear technology." Lord West, cyber security minister in the previous Labour government, has been vocal about the threat posed by China to Britain's computer networks - something always denied by the Chinese government. "China has an army of people hacking into our systems. They are engaged in industrial espionage on a massive scale," Lord West told BBC News. He is particularly concerned about the deal between BT and Huawei, which gives the Chinese telecoms giant access to Britain's telecommunications network, as highlighted earlier this year in a highly critical report by the intelligence and security committee. But the former Home Office minister says he is relatively relaxed about a Chinese company taking a stake in Britain's nuclear industry, beyond the "embarrassment" of living in a country that is no longer capable of building its own reactors. "We probably don't have to worry too much, as long as we have a separate and free state with a Parliament that retains control," he says. It is not as if China is a rogue state or about to go to war with Britain, although, he adds, things could change. "In 50 years time you never know what will happen. If someone knows your critical infrastructure very well they can do damage to it." There are also concerns about China's human rights record, which does not seem to have been mentioned by Chancellor George Osborne in his meeting with Chinese officials, despite a new Foreign Office 'action plan' urging firms to pay more attention to the issue. "It could set a dangerous precedent," says an Amnesty International spokesman, "If other countries see Britain doing business with China without mentioning human rights then they will follow suit." The key question for many, however, is why can't Britain, the country that pioneered civil nuclear energy, build its own reactors? The UK is uniquely relaxed among Western nations about foreign ownership of key national assets like nuclear power plants, says Antony Froggatt, lead author of the annual World Nuclear Industry Status Report. In the US, Australia and Canada foreign companies are prevented by law from owning critical infrastructure. EDF was recently blocked from building a third reactor at the Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant, in Maryland, due to America's ban on foreign ownership. In some European nations, state-backed "national champions", such as EDF, dominate the nuclear market, while in others, such as Germany, the industry is being wound down. British companies will be involved in building new nuclear plants, says Mr Froggatt, and there is nothing to stop the government breathing new life into Britain's own nuclear industry, which once led the world. But nuclear is a "very risky" investment without massive public subsidies, due to the long lifespan of the plants, and even mighty state-backed enterprises now like to spread the risk by seeking partners. It is also an increasingly niche business. At the nuclear industry's peak in 1979, there were 234 plants under construction around the world. Now there are just 66 - 28 of which are in China. "If you were to build up a new industry you would be better doing it in other fields," says Mr Froggatt. But he adds: "I hope that the government, by encouraging this Chinese investment isn't promising that Chinese reactors will be built in the UK because it hasn't got the power to do that." The current design of Chinese reactors would be unlikely to meet British safety standards. But experts say the real prize for the Chinese is to gain approval from the UK nuclear industry regulator, known as one of the toughest in the world, for a new generation of designs, which could open the door to Western markets. Mr Froggatt is also concerned that the political consensus in the UK, with all three main parties now firmly behind nuclear energy, has prevented tough questions being asked about the wisdom of the current policy. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, quizzed about the China deal on his weekly LBC radio show, summed up the government's laissez fare approach. "If people want to come here and build safe sustainable low-carbon ways of generating energy without dollops of British taxpayers' subsidy in a way which is entirely regulated by us, where the rules are set up by us, not in Beijing, then of course that's something we should be open to. "Because we've got to keep the lights on and we've got to protect the environment." </body>

An allegation that - once again - centres on the way Andrew Mitchell was forced from his Cabinet job for calling an officer a "f***ng pleb" - something he insists he never actually said. The minister's fate was effectively sealed after that fateful night in Downing Street when a couple of weeks later he met three representatives of the Police Federation. They stand accused of lying about what was said by Mr Mitchell at that meeting by none other than the Prime Minister himself. "Fortunately, this meeting was recorded, so he has been able to prove that what he said was true and what the police officers said was untrue," David Cameron told MPs. The officers have been effectively cleared of misconduct by their bosses - the Chief Constables of West Mercia, the West Midlands and Warwickshire - who found there was insufficient evidence against them. But the prime minister is echoing the police watchdog in declaring that to be wrong. Tonight the Independent Police Complaints Commission has gone even further revealing that the police forces involved changed their minds about their own investigation. A letter from the IPCC's deputy Chair states that: "I note that in the first draft ...the senior investigating officer did in fact conclude there was a case to answer for misconduct although their final report submitted in August did not" MPs on the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee have asked the three chief constables involved to come down to Westminster to help them with their enquiries into what on earth went on. "The fact that there is now indications of a second report - the first having been changed - is a serious alteration to the story and we need to look carefully at why there was that change," its Labour chair Keith Vaz has said. What might seem a horribly complex story is in fact rather simple. A growing number of politicians suspect the police have been systematically covering up wrong doing by those in their own ranks. </body>

      <title>Elderly care all sorted? Think again...</title>
      <description>Many pensioners face significant fees before they get help</description>

      <body>When the government unveiled its plans for a £72,000 cap on elderly care costs from 2016, ministers were quick to claim they had solved the problem. The era of huge bills for care, an issue which resulted in tens of thousands of people selling their own homes each year, was over, they said. But as politicians and campaigners sift through detail it is becoming more and more clear that all is not quite as it seems. One of the measures trumpeted by ministers was the fact that the bill individuals face could be deferred by getting councils to pay for the care and then allowing them to recoup it from an individual's estate after their death. This option is already available in some areas, but under the changes every council would have to offer it, they said. But it has now emerged the option of deferring payments will not be open to wealthier people. Only those needing residential care who have assets of less than £23,250 (excluding the value of their home) will be able to get their local council to pay the costs. For example, it means someone with £50,000 in the bank when they enter a care home will have to pay the bills as they come in until that has been reduced to £23,250. Only then will they be able to defer the costs. Labour peer Lord Lipsey believes this is such a significant loophole that it amounts to a "sabotaging" of the safeguards. The £72,000 cap will not include the amount an individual pays for the "hotel costs" of a care home - that is to say the normal cost of daily living such as food, energy bills and the accommodation. Under the reforms, these so-called "hotel costs" will be set at £12,000 a year. For a typical care home place that accounts for about a third of the fees. Therefore, it would mean that an individual could find themselves paying over £100,000 over three years (£72,000 in care fees and £36,000 in hotel costs) before the cap kicks in. And once it does they will still be liable for the £12,000-a-year hotel costs until their wealth is whittled away. With any system, there is always winners and losers. In this case it is those in the middle. The poorest will continue to get social care free as they do now. But those with assets of over £118,000 (including the value of property) will be liable for care home costs until they reach the £72,000 cap or their assets fall below the £118,000-mark. It means those with assets of between £150,000 and £200,000 face losing between a third and nearly a half of their in care costs. That compares to 0% for people with below £17,000 and a sixth for those with £500,000. Those even wealthier than that lose even less. It will be up to local authorities to calculate how much an individual has to pay. They will do this by working out the average they pay for care home places for those who get state help. This will stop people moving into a luxury care home and racking up £72,000 in costs in super quick time. Fair enough, you might say. But the problem - recognised by the Health Select Committee earlier this year - is that councils, with the benefit of buying places in bulk, can often negotiate lower fees than an individual can. This could lead to disputes over what the true costs are. The original proposals suggested setting the cap at a much lower level. But in the end ministers came up with the figure of £72,000. This was not plucked out of thin air. Once a person enters a care home, not many live beyond two years. In that time just those requiring the most intensive care are ever likely to accrue bills in excess of £72,000. It means only an estimated one in eight people will benefit from the cap, according to estimates by the government. And that is why Age UK, which has been campaigning for years for reform of the social care funding system, sees the cap as only a start. It argues the cap only benefits those with "the greatest needs" who end up in care homes "for a considerable amount of time". </body>

      <body>MPs who have a past career in front of the TV camera did well in last week's reshuffles and follow in the path of other politicians who made their name in the media before they faced the ballot box. The Daily Politics looked back into the former careers of past and present political figures who also moved from the role of interviewer to interviewee in the television studio.

      <title>The reshuffled face of politics</title>
      <description>What impact will the frontbench changes have?</description>

      <body>Reshuffles. Like the old cliché about buses, you wait ages for one then three come along at once. But how much of an impact will the latest changes in personnel have? Inside the coalition, the Conservative and Lib Dem leaders independently decided the fate of their ministers. And Ed Miliband, no longer encumbered with a shadow cabinet chosen by his MPs, had a free hand to promote fresh talent. But has the political territory shifted, or is it just the personalities that have been moved? In some ways, the face of politics is changing. Across the board, women are taking more prominent roles - so far, a net increase of four in government, and 44% of Labour's shadow cabinet are female. Among the beneficiaries are two former stars of GMTV - Esther McVey for the Conservatives, and Labour's Gloria De Piero. The equation telegenic + down to earth = promotion has been proven. Though some rather less telegenic but talented people have done well too. For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class as well as gender. That isn't a misprint. For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class. What some of our tabloid colleagues have depicted as a process of replacing the "top hats" with the "flat caps". In fact Monday didn't really amount to a revolution in millinery. It's simply that some of those who haven't been to public school are winning more prominence. Racing up the junior ranks is Sajid Javid, son of a bus driver from Rochdale. And Mike Penning - a plain-speaking former soldier and fireman - will welcome the challenge of taking the heat for welfare reforms. As a former spokesman for Iain Duncan Smith, he should, at least, have a good working relationship with his boss. So expect some of the non-cabinet ministers to speak with less expensive accents. Allies of the chancellor have also done well from the reshuffle: the aforementioned Mr Javid; Matthew Hancock, a former chief of staff to George Osborne; and the former Treasury whip Greg Hands, are all moving up. Their careers may be moving forward but their advancement doesn't signal a change in direction. None of the better-known Conservative figures around the cabinet table have been moved - any purge at the top will await the outcome of next year's European parliament elections. It was, in fact, Nick Clegg rather than David Cameron that engaged in the night of the long knives. Or, rather, the long knife. It was plunged into the front rather than the back of Micheal Moore, the Secretary of State for Scotland. He had very competently carried out negotiations on the forthcoming referendum on Scottish independence. But now that thorny issues over timing and, crucially, what question to put to the Scottish people, have had been smoothed over, it was felt that it was time to move on from the constitutional niceties and in to campaigning mode. So step forward the robust figure of the former Lib Dem chief whip Alistair Carmichael, whose job it is now to tweak Alex Salmond's tail. But at more junior level, Jeremy Browne was dismissed. This surprised some at Westminster as he had been seen as close to Nick Clegg, and he could never be described as a coalition-sceptic. Certainly working with Conservative ministers didn't seem to trouble his conscience. So it's possible that the Lib Dem leader - while continuing to liaise closely with David Cameron's colleagues - also wants his own ministers to spell out the differences between the two coalition partners more clearly in the run-up to the next election. But even Lib Dems raised eyebrows at Mr Browne's replacement at the Home Office, the former transport minster Norman Baker, the author of a book alleging a cover-up over Dr David Kelly, the government scientist whose death led to the Hutton inquiry. At first glance Ed Miliband's reshuffle marks more of a shift in position - away from his party's Blairite past. At education, Stephen Twigg - who had praised a "free school" in his area and worked hard to find a way of reconciling Michael Gove's creations with Labour's existing (and more hostile) policy - has been dumped from the shadow cabinet, as has Liam Byrne - the former shadow work and pensions secretary who accepted the principle of a cap on benefits payments. And it just so happens that in an interview with the left-of-centre New Statesman earlier, the leader of the Unite trade union Len McCluskey had described both politicians in unflattering terms. Labour sources, naturally, say that Ed Miliband didn't discuss his reshuffle with union leaders. And certainly Tristram Hunt's appointment to replace Stephen Twigg hardly marks a lurch to the left. He is close to Peter Mandelson and was parachuted into his Stoke constituency at the last election with the blessing of the then leadership. And while he has reportedly described free schools as "a vanity project for yummy mummies", expect him to champion "parent-led academies" in the future . Rather, he represents a bit of generational shift - someone who is younger than the Labour leader (not yet 40) and who can potentially appeal beyond the Westminster village - albeit to viewers of TV history shows on BBC Two and Four, rather than breakfast telly. Labour insiders say they wanted to make space for some of the 2010 intake who could prove to be energetic campaigners. That was more important than whether they were Brownite or Blairite, David or Ed. The new shadow women's and equalities minister Gloria De Piero is an admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as her party leader. And there was additional ballast against the "Blairite purge" stories - which some of the papers will write tomorrow - in the shape of Lord Falconer. He is Tony Blair's former flatmate and he has agreed to advise the party on the transition from opposition to government. The shunting of the former shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle to the environment brief has led to speculation that Labour is preparing to derail HS2. Instead, party sources insist, Mary Creagh's move to transport from shadowing Defra is a tribute to her campaigning flair during the horsemeat scandal. She is now going to be tasked with standing up not for the consumer but the commuter, arguing against higher fares as part of Labour's pre-election theme of tackling what it calls the cost-of-living crisis. But if she is a fan of HS2, she may have to turn her campaigning skills to greater effect against some of her shadow cabinet colleagues who think the money could be better spent. Amongst the sceptics is Ed Balls, supportive of the rail project in principle, but in practice stressing he can't back it "at any price". And the shadow chancellor, like his opposite number, will be pleased to see some of his key allies in important posts - including Rachel Reeves, his former number two, taking over the work and pensions brief, and Vernon Coaker moving to shadow defence. Michael Dugher, a redoubtable attack-dog who initially backed Ed Balls for leader, has been given a key role in planning for the next general election. He will be joined by Douglas Alexander (in addition to his foreign affairs role) and Spencer Livermore - the former Gordon Brown apparatchik who was - he believed unfairly - criticised by some of his colleagues for the handling of the 2007 election-that-never-was. Well, with fixed-term Parliaments now, there is little doubt when the next election will come. But perhaps the wider significance of the Labour reshuffle is what it says about the other Ed. The fact that Messrs Twigg and Byrne accepted demotions, and Jim Murphy moved from defence to international development, suggests that his leadership is secure - that there is no prospect of a shadowy group of Blairites outside of the shadow cabinet waiting - or campaigning - for Ed Miliband's political demise. At least, not this side of an election. So, in the days and months ahead, the battle lines will be more clearly drawn between rather than within the parties. </body>

      <title>EU law and budget: a video guide</title>
      <description>Matthew Price explains EU laws and budget</description>

      <body>The EU has a reputation for being slow and cumbersome - largely because of the difficulty of getting agreement among 28 member states with different languages and traditions. Here BBC Europe correspondent Matthew Price gives a video guide to the complex bargaining that results in new EU laws and the EU budget. The right to initiate legislation in the EU belongs to the European Commission - the union's civil service and rule-enforcer. Usually Commission proposals go through many amendments before becoming law - a process that takes years. In most policy areas the Council of Ministers - representing EU governments - and the European Parliament reach joint decisions through negotiation. Their role is called "the ordinary legislative procedure". During their negotiations they come under pressure from lobby groups, for example industrial firms or environmentalists. Often EU laws arise because national governments and MEPs tell the Commission that there is a need for them. Public consultations, scientific research and impact assessments also feed into the legislation. Once a measure becomes EU law the member states have two years to adopt it nationally - "transpose" it, in the jargon. The Commission can fine them for failure to do so. The budget is one of the most contentious policy areas among the member states, whose priorities differ greatly. The 2013 EU budget is 132.8bn euros (£113bn; $178bn). The size of the budget has to be decided annually, but there is also a seven-year budget framework, agreed in advance so that money can be set aside for long-term projects. This year for the first time EU leaders agreed to cut the multi-year budget (for 2014-2020), under pressure from the UK and some other countries, including the Netherlands and Sweden. The eurozone crisis has exacerbated tensions in the budget negotiations. Net contributors to the budget - the richer countries including the UK - argue that it should reflect the tough austerity policies adopted nationally. But net beneficiaries, such as the new member states in Central and Eastern Europe, oppose EU cuts to key areas like agriculture and infrastructure projects. EU spending is a small fraction of what the national governments spend in total, but those governments have to pay for big public sector areas like education and health, which are largely outside the EU's remit. </body>
