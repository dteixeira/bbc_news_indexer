      <body>People are growing increasingly desperate for food, water and medical supplies in typhoon-hit parts of the Philippines, a congressman has warned. Martin Romualdez, from badly-hit Leyte, said a greater sense of urgency was needed to get aid to those in need. The UN says more than 11 million people may have been affected and some 673,000 displaced by Typhoon Haiyan. On Tuesday, eight people died when a wall collapsed as thousands of survivors mobbed a food warehouse. Police and soldiers were unable to stop the looters, who took more than 100,000 sacks of rice from the government facility in Alangalang, Leyte, said Rex Estoperez, spokesman for the National Food Authority. Speaking to CNN on Tuesday, Philippine President Benigno Aquino said the death toll may be lower than first thought. The widely reported figure of 10,000 killed may have come from officials facing "emotional trauma", he said, and the real figure was more likely up to 2,500. But he said 29 municipalities had yet to be contacted to establish the number of victims there. The president also warned that storms like Haiyan - known in the Philippines as Yolanda - were becoming more frequent, and there should be "no debate" that climate change was happening. He said either the world committed to action on climate change "or let us be prepared to meet disasters". Typhoon Haiyan - one of the most powerful storms ever recorded on land - hit the coastal provinces of Leyte and Samar on Friday. It swept through six central Philippine islands before going on to kill several people in Vietnam and southern China. The Philippines National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) has put the official death toll at 1,833, as of 06:00 local time (22:00 GMT) on Wednesday. The number of injured stands at 2,623 with 84 listed as missing. Relief operations are being stepped up, but damage to transport links and continuing bad weather have hindered aid distribution. The BBC's Jonathan Head in Tacloban - a city of 220,000 on Leyte island which is particularly badly affected - says residents are becoming angry at the lack of progress and increasing breakdown in security. Planes are arriving at the airport, but bringing little in and only taking people out, and there is little sign of a co-ordinated relief operation, he says. Martin Romualdez told the BBC that he believed the government was giving "conservative" estimates of the death toll "so as not to cause undue alarm". "But just viewing the disaster's scope - its magnitude and the areas affected - we believe that the 10,000 figure is more probable," he said. "As we start cleaning up we are finding more bodies." He said the "sense of urgency should be stepped up at the national level as the international relief organisations come in". "Better co-ordination is needed, because we are seeing a lot of relief goods, medicines, equipment, coming in, but it's not reaching the people affected, thereby causing a sense of hopelessness and desperation in many of those who have survived and are now fleeing their homes, their municipalities, their locales, out of sheer desperation." He said the damage to Tacloban was "so massive in scale and so extensive in our areas that we literally would have to rebuild from scratch". "We just imagine it, our area, as a ground zero, as if a nuclear bomb had exploded above us." Philippine armed forces spokesman Ramon Zagala told the BBC teams were struggling to reach isolated places. "Although we have a lot of helicopters at the moment, it's really a challenge for us to bring [aid] to all the places and [bring] the number of goods that are needed." But Philippine Interior Minister Mar Roxas told the BBC that relief efforts were on track. "Our first priorities were, number one, to establish law and order; number two, to bring food and water to the people; and, number three, to recover the cadaver bags," he said. "[Now] law and order has been stabilised, the supply of food and water is beginning - I'm not saying that we're anywhere near it - [but it] is beginning to be stabilised... and now we are concentrating on recovery of cadavers as well as on the distribution of the food and the relief that is coming in." On Tuesday the UN launched an appeal for $301m (£190m) to help survivors. It has already released $25m to meet immediate needs. The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says 11.3 million people are in need of vital goods and services, because of factors such as lack of food, healthcare and access to education and livelihoods. The UK's Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) has also launched an appeal. US and British navy vessels are heading to the Philippines and several nations have pledged millions of dollars in aid.

      <title>Afghan opium harvest at record high</title>
      <description>Afghan opium cultivation reaches a record level, with more than 200,000 hectares planted with the poppy for the first time, a UN report says.</description>

      <body>Afghan opium cultivation has reached a record level, with more than 200,000 hectares planted with the poppy for the first time, the United Nations says. The UNODC report said the harvest was 36% up on last year, and if fully realised would outstrip global demand. Most of the rise was in Helmand province, where British troops are preparing to withdraw. One of the main reasons the UK sent troops to Helmand was to cut opium production. The head of the UN office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Kabul, Jean-Luc Lemahieu, said that production was likely to rise again next year, amid uncertainty over the withdrawal of most foreign troops and the presidential election. He said that the illegal economy was taking over in importance from legitimate business, and that prices remained high since there was a ready availability of cash in Afghanistan because of aid. "As long as we think that we can have short-term, fast solutions for the counter-narcotics, we are continued to be doomed to fail," he added. Mr Lemahieu said there had been some recent successes, including the arrest of leading figures in the drugs industry, but it could take 10-15 years to deal with Afghanistan's opium crisis, even if policies improved. The report said the total area planted with poppies rose from 154,000 to 209,000 hectares, while potential production rose by 49% to 5,500 tonnes, more than the current global demand. Half of the cultivation area is in Helmand province. Meanwhile two northern provinces which had previously been declared poppy-free - Faryab and Balkh - lost that status. The report called for an integrated, comprehensive response to the problem. "If the drug problem is not taken more seriously by aid, development and security actors, the virus of opium will further reduce the resistance of its host, already suffering from dangerously low immune levels due to fragmentation, conflict, patronage, corruption and impunity," it said. But the report said there were some encouraging signs, with police tripling their effectiveness to capture "well over 10%" of production and a growth in services set up to tackle addiction. The findings of the latest report reverse a decline in production last year attributed to bad weather and disease. However, cultivation has been rising yearly since 2010 despite government efforts to eradicate the crop. More farmers have been trying to grow the poppy as the price of opium has been rising. Afghanistan produces more than 90% of the world's opium. </body>

      <title>Bacon painting fetches record price</title>
      <description>A Francis Bacon painting is sold for $142m (£89m) in New York, becoming the most expensive artwork ever auctioned.</description>

      <body>A painting by Francis Bacon of his friend and fellow artist Lucian Freud has become the most expensive artwork ever sold at auction after it fetched $142m (£89m, 106m euros) in New York. The triptych, Three Studies of Lucian Freud (1969), is considered one of Bacon's greatest masterpieces. It was sold after six minutes of fierce bidding, Christie's auction house said. The price eclipsed the $119.9m (£74m) paid for Edvard Munch's The Scream last year. At the same auction, Jeff Koons broke the world record for a price paid for a single artwork by a living artist. His sculpture Balloon Dog (Orange) - one of a series of five stainless steel sculptures in varying colours - fetched $58,4m (£36.7m). The previous record for a living artist was set by a Gerhard Richter painting depicting an Italian city square, which sold in May for $37.1 million (£23.3m). It was the first time Three Studies of Lucian Freud had been offered at auction and bidding opened at $80m (£50m, 60m euros). Its presale estimate was $85m (£53m, 64m euros). A telephone bidder won with an offer of $127 million (£80m), which, after commission, means they will pay a total of $142m. The auction house did not disclose the identity of the buyer. Bacon, known for his triptychs, painted Three Studies of Lucian Freud in 1969 at London's Royal College of Art, after his studio was destroyed in a fire. Francis Outred, head of Post-War and Contemporary Art at Christie's Europe, said the work was "a true masterpiece and one of the greatest paintings to come up for auction in a current generation". "It marks Bacon and Freud's relationship, paying tribute to the creative and emotional kinship between the two artists," he added. The pair met in 1945 and became close companions, painting each other on a number of occasions, before their relationship cooled during the 1970s. Exhibited in Bacon's renowned retrospective at the Grand Palais, Paris in 1971-1972, the three panels that form the painting were separated in the mid-1970s. One panel was shown at the Tate in 1985 before the three sections were reassembled. The complete work was displayed in New Haven, Connecticut in 1999. It got its first ever UK public viewing at Christie's in London in October this year. </body>

      <title>Israel backtracks on settlements</title>
      <description>Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu orders his housing minister to reconsider construction plans for more than 20,000 homes in the West Bank.</description>

      <body>Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered his housing minister to reconsider construction plans for more than 20,000 homes in the West Bank. He said the plans, announced by Housing Minister Uri Ariel earlier on Tuesday, would create unnecessary friction with the international community. The US had earlier said it was "deeply concerned" over the Israeli plans. The Palestinians had said they would appeal to the UN, warning that Israel's move would kill off peace talks. In a statement, Mr Netanyahu said he had asked Housing Minister Uri Ariel "to reconsider" plans for potential construction of new homes for Jewish settlers in the West Bank. The prime minister added that such a move would make no contribution to Jewish settlements and "creates an unnecessary confrontation with the international community at a time when we are making an effort to persuade elements in the international community to reach a better deal with Iran". Mr Netanyahu was referring to recent talks in Geneva on Tehran's controversial programme that ended without a deal. The statement added that Mr Ariel had accepted the prime minister's request. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas earlier warned that current stalled peace talks with Israel would be effectively over if Israel proceeded with the construction. The Palestinians also said they would appeal to the UN to urgently discuss the issue. In Washington, state department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said earlier the US was "deeply concerned" by Israel's plans. She added that America would seek "further explanation" from Israel on the issue. Last week, US Secretary of State John Kerry emphasised Washington's rejection of Israeli settlement activity as "illegitimate". The direct Israeli-Palestinian peace talks launched in July have shown little sign of progress. A previous round of negotiations collapsed in September 2010 in a bitter row over Israeli settlements. Mr Netanyahu wants Palestinian recognition of Israel as a Jewish state as a priority, whereas the Palestinians say borders and security top their agenda. The Palestinians want their state to include all land captured by Israel in 1967, but some 500,000 Jews now live in more than 200 settlements and outposts in the West Bank including East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. However, Mr Netanyahu has rejected any return to the pre-1967 ceasefire lines as "indefensible", saying it would not take into account the "demographic changes on the ground". Mutually-agreed land swaps have been discussed in previous talks as a way to overcome this problem. </body>

      <title>Concerns over UN rights body members</title>
      <description>China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam are elected to the UN's highest human rights watchdog, despite concerns about their rights records.</description>

      <body>China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Vietnam have been elected to the UN's human rights watchdog, despite concerns about their rights records. Campaign groups have condemned the election of the countries to the 47-seat Human Rights Council. Human Rights Watch said some new members had denied access to UN monitors investigating alleged abuses. The UN General Assembly elected a total of 14 new members to the Geneva-based council on Tuesday. China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Algeria and Cuba won seats unopposed, but human rights groups have complained that they are the countries that the body should be censuring. New York-based Human Rights Watch singled out five countries - China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and Algeria - which have denied access to UN human rights monitors keen to investigate alleged abuses. "Countries that haven't allowed UN experts appointed by the council to visit have a lot of explaining to do," said Peggy Hicks, the group's global advocacy director. And UN Watch, a frequent critic of UN practices, also accused these countries, along with Algeria, of systematically violating the rights of their citizens. The newly members will be on the council for three years from 2014. The body aims to shine a spotlight on rights abuses by adopting resolutions. UN Watch made a broader criticism of the Human Rights Council, accusing it of repeatedly criticising Israel while failing to adopt a resolution that has been critical of China, Russia or Saudi Arabia. The Human Rights Council was created in 2006 to replace the UN's widely discredited Human Rights Commission. But the council has faced similar criticism to the commission, with the election of countries with questionable track records in human rights. South Sudan and Uruguay failed to win seats in the competitive elections for their regional grouping on Tuesday. The other regions had uncontested votes. </body>

      <title>Syria Kurds plan transitional rule</title>

      <body>Syria's largest Kurdish party has said it plans to form an transitional administration. The administration would rule Kurdish-majority areas in the northeast until the broader conflict is over. Kurdish groups in northern Syria have tried to stay out of the civil war between the government and rebels. However, Islamist rebels have moved into Kurdish-controlled areas in recent months, causing increasing clashes between them and Kurdish militias. The Democratic Union Party (PYD) announced the move after two days of talks in the town of Qamishli in north-eastern Syria. Alan Semo, the PYD's UK-based representative, told the BBC his party was not seeking to carve out a separate Kurdish state. Mr Semo said the region would be "integrated in future in a united, democratic, plural Syria", adding that neighbouring Turkey, which has fought a long war against Kurdish rebels, had nothing to fear from the move. "I think Turkey will realise that this step is not a threat to any regional or international or global stability, it is temporary," he added. The PYD planned to introduce a constitution and regional parliament, with representation for non-Kurds in the area, he went on. However, it is not clear whether all Kurdish factions will take part in the administration. "I think that such a rushed, one-sided move will be seen as... an obstacle to the Syrian opposition," Nuri Brimo, a member of the Kurdish National Council (KNC), an alliance of 13 Kurdish parties, told AFP. A de facto autonomous Kurdish zone was created when government forces withdrew from the area in the summer of 2012. Last month Kurdish fighters took control of a border crossing with Iraq from an Islamist rebel group. Syria's Kurdish minority makes up around 10% of the population and is largely concentrated in the country's far north-east, near the borders with Turkey and Iraq. The fighting between jihadist rebels and armed Kurdish militia has added another layer to Syria's complex civil war. </body>

      <title>Abducted US sailors freed in Nigeria</title>

      <body>Two US sailors kidnapped in October from a ship off Nigeria's coast have been freed, the state department says. The two men were the captain and chief engineer of the US-flagged C-Retriever oil supply ship, it says. State department spokeswoman Jen Psaki declined to provide any details how the sailors were released. Incidents of piracy off Nigeria's coast have increased this year as gangs try to snatch cargoes from ships passing through the Gulf of Guinea. The C-retriever was stormed by gunmen on 23 October near the coastal town of Brass in Nigeria's oil rich Bayelsa State. The captain and the chief engineer - whose names have not been released - where then led away by the attackers. No group has said it carried out the attack. The International Maritime Bureau has recorded more than 40 attacks in the area this year with 132 crew taken hostage. The gangs usually target the oil vessels to steal the cargo. It is estimated that oil product worth approximately $100m (approximately £62m) has been stolen since 2010. In recent months there have been numerous kidnappings of foreign oil workers and wealthy Nigerians, especially in the oil-producing Niger Delta region. They have often been held until a ransom payment is made and then released unharmed. </body>

      <title>Clinton chides Obama on healthcare</title>
      <description>Bill Clinton says President Barack Obama should honour his pledge to let people keep their medical coverage, even if it means changing the health law.</description>

      <body>Former US President Bill Clinton says President Barack Obama should find a way to let Americans keep their health coverage under Obamacare. Insurance companies have cancelled numerous policies that do not meet the law's strict requirements, even though Mr Obama initially pledged otherwise. Mr Clinton said his fellow Democrat should "honour" his commitment, even if it means changing the law. Republicans seized on Mr Clinton's comments. In addition to the cancelled insurance policies, the federal website established under the law - which allows consumers to shop for private health insurance plans - has been plagued by glitches. Mr Clinton campaigned for the Affordable Care Act, but now he is the latest politician to speak out against it. "I personally believe, even if it takes a change in the law, that the president should honour the commitment the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they've got," Mr Clinton said in an interview published on Tuesday. The former president - who is a Democrat, like Mr Obama - did reaffirm his support for the healthcare law, though, saying: "The big lesson is we're better off with this programme than we are without it." His comments come just days after Mr Obama apologised to those people whose policies have been cancelled under Obamacare. "I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me," he said in an interview with NBC News on 8 November. "We didn't do a good enough job in terms of how we crafted the law," he added. "We've got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them, and we are going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this." On Tuesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the president was exploring possible administrative action. "The president has tasked his team with looking at a range of options," Mr Carney said. Republicans - who have fought the president's healthcare law at every turn - seized on Mr Clinton's comments, claiming they "signify a growing recognition that Americans were misled". "The entire healthcare law is a train wreck that needs to go," House Speaker John Boehner said, a form of words often-used in Republican attacks on the law. "While the two parties may disagree on that point, it shouldn't stop reasonable Democrats from working with us to shield Americans from its most egregious consequences - like the millions of current health plans being cancelled," he added. The House of Representatives is expected to consider Republican-sponsored legislation later this week that would allow consumers to keep their coverage. The White House has said it is against that proposal, which would allow insurers to continue selling medical coverage that does not offer the level of benefits required under Obamacare. "Any fix that would essentially open up for insurers the ability to sell new plans that do not meet standards would create more problems than it fixed," said Mr Carney. </body>

      <body>Somalia's government has declared the north-eastern region of Puntland hit by a tropical cyclone at the weekend a disaster area. The number of people killed by the cyclone has risen from about 100 to 300, unconfirmed reports say. Thousands of livestock had also died and hundreds of homes had been destroyed by the cyclone, known as 03A. More floods were expected during the next 48 hours, Somalia's Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon said. Puntland is a semi-autonomous region within Somalia, where many people are poor. The cyclone had swept through the Eyl, Beyla, Dangorayo and Hafun districts along the eastern coast and across to Alula at the tip of the Horn of Africa. Declaring a disaster, Somalia's Interior Minister Abdikarim Hussein Guled said the central government pledged $1m (£628,000) to help communities devastated by the cyclone. The government "shared the pain" of communities, Mr Shirdon said. Nearly 300 people are feared dead in the cyclone, the pro-Puntland government news site, Garoweonline, reports. On Monday, Puntland's government said up to 100 people had been killed. "Preliminary information also indicates that homes, buildings, boats and entire villages have been destroyed and over 100,000 livestock lost, endangering the livelihoods of tens of thousands of local people," it said, in a statement. Relief efforts have been hampered after roads and air strips were washed away. Electricity has also been disrupted and mobile phone masts destroyed, making communication extremely difficult, the Puntland government said. Trucks loaded with 60 tonnes of food, clean water and blankets headed are stuck in Puntland's Nugal region because flash floods have made many areas inaccessible, Garoweonline reports. Puntland's President Abdirahman Farole called on the international community to help, and said helicopters should be used to air-drop relief aid. "I have buried 10 members of my family, the icy storm and rain killed more than 100 people here," a resident of Eyl, Hussein Abdullahi, told the Reuters news agency on Monday. "I have never witnessed such fatal cold. Some people were blown away and others died after their houses collapsed on them." </body>

      <title>Hawaii passes gay marriage bill</title>
      <description>Hawaii is set to become the latest US state to allow gay marriage after it passed a bill legalising same-sex unions.</description>

      <body>Hawaii is set to become the latest US state to allow gay marriage after it passed a bill legalising same-sex unions. The state's Senate approved the measure by 19 votes to 4. Hawaii's Democratic governor indicated he would sign the bill into law without delay. It is expected to come into effect on 2 December. Same-sex marriages are currently legal in 14 US states and the District of Columbia. Correspondents say the bill is likely to make Hawaii a popular wedding destination for same-sex couples. Researchers at the University of Hawaii have said that the law will boost tourism income by $217m (£136m) over the next three years. "I look forward to signing this significant piece of legislation, which provides marriage equity and fully recognises and protects religious freedoms," Governor Neil Abercrombie said on Tuesday. US President Barack Obama welcomed Tuesday's vote, saying: "I've always been proud to have been born in Hawaii, and today's vote makes me even prouder." Many credit a 1990 Hawaii case in which two women applied for a marriage licence with starting the whole nationwide debate on gay unions. It led at least 30 other states to ban same-sex marriage and prompted Congress to pass the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act. That law, defining marriage as between a man and a woman, was struck down by the US Supreme Court earlier this year. Tuesday's vote in Hawaii adds to the momentum for gay marriage rights in the US. Illinois senators passed a same-sex marriage bill earlier this month, and Governor Pat Quinn said he would sign it into law on 20 November. </body>

      <body>The Colombian government says it has uncovered a plot by the country's largest rebel group, the Farc, to kill the former president, Alvaro Uribe. Defence Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon said the assassination was due to be carried out by a rebel column operating in central Colombia. Mr Pinzon said security around the former president had been reinforced. Mr Uribe is an outspoken critic of the current peace process between the rebels and the government. Mr Pinzon said he had met Mr Uribe, who is running for the Senate in next year's elections, to inform him of the threat. The assassination was being plotted by the Farc's Teofilo Forero Mobile Column, under the command of a rebel known as Paisa, said Mr Pinzon. Mr Uribe's father was killed by the Farc in 1983 in a failed kidnapping attempt. During Mr Uribe's two terms in office, from 2002 to 2010, the Colombian army inflicted heavy defeats on the rebels. The peace talks were launched a year ago in the Cuban capital, Havana. They are aimed at ending five decades of bloody conflict, with the left-wing rebels agreeing to give up their armed struggle and join the legal political process. Agreement has been reached so far on land reform and political participation - two of the six issues being discussed. The other four items on the peace agenda are disarmament, illicit drugs, rights of the victims and peace deal implementation. But fighting has carried on despite the talks. President Juan Manuel Santos's government has refused to agree to a ceasefire, as requested by the rebels, saying it would only help them regroup and rearm. Five decades of internal conflict in Colombia have led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people. A study by Colombia's National Centre for Historical Memory suggests 220,000 people have died in the violence. </body>

      <description>A ban on slaughtering animals anywhere except at a central abattoir comes into force in the Somali capital as part of moves to improve hygiene.</description>

      <body>A ban on slaughtering animals anywhere except at a central abattoir has come into force in the Somali capital. Until the start of the civil war in 1991, all meat had to be butchered at the Mogadishu Slaughterhouse. The local authorities have now paid for the premises on the eastern outskirts of Mogadishu to be revamped and the abattoir has reopened for business. The BBC's Ibrahim Mohamed says it is part of moves to improve hygiene in the city recovering from years of conflict. Our reporter says traders in Mogadishu have welcomed the move, saying it will be good for business to be able to market "clean meat". The Mogadishu Slaughterhouse is a partnership between the local city government and a private firm, Limco Ltd, he says. The head of the abattoir, Abdullahi Museh, says 452 people work at the slaughterhouse, which has running water and electricity and is divided into three sections for camels, goats and cows. At the moment 170 camels, 500 goats and 100 cows were slaughtered each day, he told the BBC's Somali Service. Lorries distribute meat each day to different markets across the city and herders and private individuals could make use of its services, he said. It costs about $10 (£6) to butcher a camel, $5 for a cow and $3 for a goat. Our correspondent says the opening of the abattoir is the latest public service to return to the city, which is slowly recovering from occupation by rival warlords and latterly Islamist militants. Somalia has the largest population of camels in Africa, many of which are exported to the Arabian Gulf. </body>

      <body>A committee of architects has declared New York City's newly erected One World Trade Center the tallest building in the US, at 1,776ft (541m). The Height Committee of the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat announced its decision in Chicago. The previous title holder was that city's tallest building, the Willis Tower, at 1,451ft (442m). The committee ruled a 408ft needle at the top counted toward its height. Antony Wood, executive director of the committee, which is seen as the final official word on building heights around the world, said the needle counted as a permanent structure. The spire will serve as a broadcast antenna upon the building's completion in 2014. Without that needle, the building measures 1,368 feet, well below the height of the Willis Tower, which was formerly known as the Sears Tower. Both skyscrapers fall well short of the world's tallest building, the 2,723ft (830m) Burj Khalifa in Dubai. One World Trade Center was built on the lower Manhattan site of the iconic Twin Towers, which were destroyed in the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 along with other buildings in the World Trade Center complex. More than 2,000 people were killed there. The tower's height of 1,776ft is a symbolic reference to the year of the signing of the US declaration of independence from Britain. "The committee was well aware of the gravity of the situation," Mr Wood said. One World Trade Center is also home to a museum and memorial to those lost in the attacks. In a plaza under the tower, two large pools sit in the footprints of the original Twin Towers and contain the largest manmade waterfalls in the country. </body>

      <body>A man with the eye-catching name Batman bin Suparman has been jailed on theft and drugs charges. Well before this case, his double-barrelled superhero name had given him something of cult following on social media. The jokes on social media are aplenty following the news that a 23-year-old man, Batman bin Suparman, has been given a prison sentence of 33 months by a court in Singapore. Batman was arrested after being caught stealing money from a shop, as well as using his brother's cash card to withdraw money. Far-fetched as it seems, this unusual name does appear to be entirely genuine - and it's not gone unnoticed. Back in May 2008, a Singaporean ID card belonging to one Batman bin Suparman began being widely shared on social media. It was picked up by the blog Gizmodo and ran from there. Since then, the picture has been re-posted over 300 times, there have been more 15,000 tweets using his name, and a Facebook fan page has been set up in his honour. It has more than 11,000 followers. Batman bin Suparman's family appear to be originally from the Indonesia island of Java - where the name Suparman is very common, explains Ben Zimmer, a language columnist for the Wall Street Journal, who has worked in Indonesia and who has written about Suparman. "Su" has Sanskrit origins and is a common prefix in Indonesia, featuring in a whole rung of Indonesian presidents' names - including the current one Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. "Bin" means "son of" in Arabic, making it very likely that Batman's father was also called Suparman. The Batman part is a bit harder to explain, however says Zimmer, as it's not a traditional name in the region. The most likely explanation is that his parents chose it as a joke - Batman the superhero is popular there, and Indonesians are often playful in the names they choose, says Zimmer. "I see the name as this interesting juxtaposition of local naming with Western pop culture." Zimmer, for one, says he was sad to hear the news of Batman's arrest and sentencing. He believes one of the reasons he became such a star on social media was because of how how young and innocent he looked. Reporting by Cordelia Hebblethwaite Have you got a very unusual name?

      <title>New US advice on cholesterol drugs</title>
      <description>A third of all adult Americans should consider taking cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, according to the first such guidelines issued in a decade.</description>

      <body>A third of all adult Americans should consider taking cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, according to the first such new guidelines in a decade. It is estimated that 33 million Americans - 44% of men and 22% of women - would meet the threshold for taking statins, under the advice issued by two leading US medical organisations. The drugs are currently recommended for 15% of adults. The guidelines for the first time take aim at strokes, not just heart attacks. Under the current advice, statins are recommended for those who have total cholesterol over 200 and LDL, or "bad cholesterol", of over 100. But the new recommendations, issued by the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology, place much less emphasis on setting numerical cholesterol-lowering targets for patients. The advice introduces a new formula for calculating a patient's risk of heart disease based on such factors as age, gender and race, instead of high cholesterol levels alone. "This guideline represents a departure from previous guidelines because it doesn't focus on specific target levels of LDL, or bad cholesterol, although the definition of optimal LDL cholesterol has not changed," Dr Neil Stone, author of the report, said in a statement. It is thought that more women and African-Americans, who are deemed to be at higher risk of stroke, could find themselves taking statins if they follow the guidelines. The panel focused on four groups they believe statins would benefit most: people already suffering from heart disease; those with LDL levels of 190 or higher because of genetic risk; older adults with type 2 diabetes; and older adults with a 10-year risk of heart disease greater that 7.5%. The panel also recommended a "diet pattern" based on vegetables, fruits and whole grains and moderate to vigorous exercise three to four times a week for all adults. Roughly half of those drafting the guidelines had financial ties to makers of heart drugs. But panel leaders said that no-one with industry connections was allowed to vote on the actual recommendations. "It is practically impossible to find a large group of outside experts in the field who have no relationships to industry," Dr George Mensah, of the AHA, told the Associated Press news agency. He said the guidelines were based on solid evidence. Many of the patents on popular statins, such as Lipitor and Zocor, have expired, with generic versions being offered cheaply. But Crestor, a statin made by AstraZeneca, remains under patent, with sales of $8.3bn (£5.2bn) in 2012. </body>

      <title>Starbucks to pay $3bn over Kraft row</title>
      <description>Starbucks has been ordered to pay almost $3bn in damages and other costs in a dispute with Kraft Foods over packaged coffee.</description>

      <body>An independent US arbitrator has told Starbucks to pay $2.76bn (£1.74bn) in damages and other costs to Kraft Foods in a dispute over packaged coffee. Kraft began selling bags of Starbucks branded coffee in 1998 under a deal that was due to run until March 2014. But the US coffee chain ended the contract in 2010, accusing Kraft of breaking the terms of their deal. Kraft challenged that move by starting arbitration proceedings saying it had built a business worth $500m a year. On Tuesday the arbitrator ruled that Starbucks must pay $2.23bn in damages plus $527m in interest and legal costs. Kraft Foods was spun off by Mondelez International last year and under an agreement between those two firms the payments from the case will go to Mondelez. "We're pleased that the arbitrator validated our position that Starbucks breached our successful and long-standing contractual relationship without proper compensation," said Mondelez. In a statement Starbucks said it "strongly disagreed" with the conclusions of the arbitrator. "We believe Kraft did not deliver on its responsibilities to our brand under the agreement, the performance of the business suffered as a result, and that we had a right to terminate the agreement without payment to Kraft," it said. </body>

      <title>Venezuela 'to expand price controls'</title>
      <description>Following the government's seizure of electronic shops, the Venezuelan leader says he intends to broaden price controls to all consumer goods.</description>

      <body>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says he plans to extend price controls to all consumer goods, if he is given powers to govern by decree. In a televised address, Mr Maduro said that he wanted to set legal limits on businesses' profit margins. His announcement followed the seizure on Saturday of shops accused of selling electronic goods at inflated prices. The National Assembly is expected to vote this week on his request to govern temporarily by decree. The president demanded there be "zero tolerance with speculators" in his speech broadcast on Sunday. "This is beyond usury, this is theft," he added. On the weekend, soldiers occupied a chain of shops selling electronic goods which, according to Mr Maduro, had sold items at vastly inflated prices. Hundreds of people flocked to the Daka stores after they were forced by the government to sell their goods at lower prices, some of them at a quarter of the price listed earlier in the week. "We're doing this for the good of the nation," the president said, accusing the managers of the stores of waging an "economic war" against Venezuela. He also announced the arrest of five managers from the Daka, JVG and Krash electronics stores on suspicion of hiking up prices. Five more people were arrested for allegedly looting a Daka shop in the city of Valencia. But President Maduro said reports of looting had been exaggerated by factions of the press, which he accused of "complicity with the bourgeois parasites". The president announced that he would next turn his attention to stores selling toys, cars, food items, textiles and shoes. Opposition leader Henrique Capriles said the move proved that the president "is a failed puppet of the Cuban government". "Every time he opens his mouth, he scares away the investments that create employment, and he worsens the crisis," said Mr Capriles, who narrowly lost to Mr Maduro in April's presidential election. Official figures suggest inflation is running at more than 50%. Price hikes have become an important issue in next month's local elections. Mr Maduro blames most of Venezuela's economic woes on "sabotage" by opposition forces, but critics say government mismanagement is behind the country's problems. Opponents say the president's crackdown on price inflation is an attempt to boost his popularity with poor voters ahead of the local polls on 8 December. Mr Maduro has asked the National Assembly to give him special powers to fight corruption and "economic sabotage". The measure is expected to be voted on this week. </body>

      <body>Fifa has decided to use an accredited laboratory in Switzerland to analyse player blood and urine samples for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Brazil, which hosts the World Cup next summer, does not have a functioning anti-doping laboratory. The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) revoked the status of the current lab in Rio de Janeiro earlier this year. As the lab cannot be re-accredited in time for next summer, samples will be flown to Lausanne. Fifa said in a statement: "For next year's World Cup, Fifa and Wada will ensure the best possible analysis of urine and blood samples and the proper implementation of the new strategy in the fight against doping by means of the steroid module of the athlete biological passport. "Fifa is now taking the necessary logistical steps for the shipment of samples overseas." Jerome Valcke, Fifa's general secretary, wrote on Twitter:  "Fifa anti-doping decision wasn't our first choice. Together with @wada_ama we had no other alternative to protect integity of #WorldCup." Last month, Fifa's chief medical officer Michel D'Hooghe said it was "nearly impossible to believe" that Brazil, which also hosts the Olympic Games in 2016, does not have a facility to carry out testing. He added that sending samples to Europe would increase costs significantly and would also delay the whole testing process. The Wada-accredited facility in Lausanne was used during the 2013 Confederation Cup in Brazil to analyse the biological profile of athletes. </body>

      <title>Egypt lifting state of emergency</title>
      <description>Egypt's state of emergency and night-time curfew - in place since 14 August - are being lifted, the army-backed government says.</description>

      <body>Egypt's government says it is lifting the country's three-month state of emergency and night-time curfew. The move comes two days earlier than expected, after a court ruling. An aide to the prime minister said the measures had ended at 14:00 GMT, but the government later said it was still waiting for the text of the ruling. The measures were introduced on 14 August after security forces forcibly ended sit-ins in support of ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. They had been due to last a month, but the government extended them for two more months on 12 September. An adviser to Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi told the BBC that both the state of emergency and the 01:00-05:00 curfew were lifted with effect from 16:00 local time (14:00 GMT) on Tuesday. This followed the ruling by the administrative court that said the decree extending the measures should only be effective for two calendar months. However, a cabinet statement then said Cairo was still waiting for the text of the ruling before implementing it. The statement also stressed that the army-backed government would abide by the verdict. The state of emergency and the curfew allowed the authorities to make arrests without warrants and search people's homes. Many people have also blamed the curfew for a fall in business in Cairo - at a time when the government is trying to create jobs and revive the economy. The measures were introduced after hundreds of people died following the clearing of the pro-Morsi camps in the capital. Mr Morsi, the country's first democratically elected president, was ousted by the army in July following widespread demonstrations against his rule. He is currently on trial for allegedly inciting the killing of protesters outside the presidential palace in 2012. Egyptians lived under a state of emergency - which gives extra powers to the security services - for more than three decades, until President Hosni Mubarak was forced from power amid mass protests in 2011. Even with Thursday's moves, Egypt's military-backed government will still be keeping a tight grip, the BBC's Orla Guerin in Cairo reports. The authorities say security forces will be deployed on main streets and in city centres across the country to tighten control, our correspondent says. And she adds that stringent new limits on freedom of movement are expected to be introduced soon, in a law regulating public protest. Human rights campaigners say the proposals will give police the power to ban protests outright. A draft legislation - currently being considered by Interim President Adly Mahmud Mansour - requires protest organisers to notify police in advance of any meeting of more than 10 people, in public or in private. </body>

      <body>The Democratic Republic of Congo has refused to sign a deal with the rebels it defeated last week, the country's information minister has said. Lambert Mende said the title of the Ugandan-mediated document was the problem, not its contents. It should be called a declaration not an accord as that gave too much credibility to the rebels, he said. Last week, the M23 rebel group ended its 18-month insurgency in eastern DR Congo and surrendered. The two sides had been due to sign the document in the Ugandan capital, Kampala. But Mr Mende told the BBC's Focus on Africa radio programme that DR Congo's delegation had now left the talks in Kampala. He said the Ugandan mediators had refused to accede to DR Congo's request that the document be titled "a declaration". By calling the document an agreement or an accord, "they are trying to give credibility to criminals", the minister told the BBC. "You sign an agreement with a body that is legitimate and that exists. The M23 is not legitimate: on the contrary it is a criminal group - labelled as such by the international community. It was also a question of the government's credibility in the eyes of the Congolese people - it could not be seen to be signing an agreement on an equal footing with "criminals", Mr Mende said. "Militarily, we have finished M23 and what is more important for us is to maintain our credibility towards the Congolese people," he said. Okello Oryem, Uganda's junior foreign affairs minister, did not comment on the accusations, but said he expected it would take a few more days before any deal to be signed, the Reuters news agency reports. The BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga in Kampala says some Congolese security officials and other delegates are still in Kampala. Mr Mende said there were 11 points in the document on which both sides agreed. "We didn't go to Kampala to negotiate, we went to hear the grievances of our compatriots of M23," he said. The UN special envoy to DR Congo, Martin Kobler, told Focus on Africa that he was confident the talks would resume after a "cooling off" period. While the M23 had been defeated, a political solution was still required, he said. "It's the military end of the M23 but the political problem of the M23 doesn't go away," Mr Kobler added. At least 800,000 people fled their homes after the M23 took up arms in April 2012. Eastern DR Congo has been wracked by conflict since 1994, when Hutu militias fled across the border from Rwanda after carrying out a genocide against Tutsis and moderate Hutus. According the charity Oxfam, there are currently more than 30 other groups are operating in the east. </body>

      <body>Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has begun steps to scrap the carbon tax, introducing a repeal bill at the first meeting of the new parliament. Mr Abbott, who was elected in September, had made revoking the controversial tax an election pledge. He intends to replace the tax with a Direct Action plan, where industries will be paid to reduce emissions. However, the bill is not expected to pass the Senate, where Mr Abbott's coalition lacks a majority. Australia's new parliamentary season began on Tuesday, with Liberal MP Bronwyn Bishop overseeing proceedings as the new Speaker. Introducing the legislation, Mr Abbott described the 7 September election as "a referendum on the carbon tax". "This is our bill to reduce your bills, to reduce the bills of the people of Australia," he added. The controversial tax, which was introduced under the previous Labor government, imposed a levy on the 300 biggest polluters. Australia is the developed world's worst polluter per head of population. But Mr Abbott said that the tax cost jobs and forced energy prices up. The bill is expected to be approved by Australia's lower house, where Mr Abbott's Liberal-National coalition has a majority. However, the opposition Labor party, which introduced the original carbon tax, and the Greens are both opposed to Mr Abbott's Direct Action plan, and say they will vote down the bill in the Senate. Senator and Greens leader Christine Milne said the government was destroying Australia's means of reducing carbon emissions. "When are we going to stand up and accept the science and act?" she said. The repeal bill cannot be passed without Senate approval. The new senators elected in September's polls, including those representing minor parties who may support the repeal, do not take their seats until July 2014. Mr Abbott's speech was interrupted by several shouting protesters, who were ejected from the public gallery. </body>

      <body>The chief of India's top investigation agency has said he regretted his remark on rape after criticism from women's groups. Ranjit Sinha made the remark while speaking on illegal sports betting. "If you cannot enforce the ban on betting, it is like saying 'if you can't prevent rape, you enjoy it'," he said at a meeting on sports ethics. Women leaders like Brinda Karat of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) said Mr Sinha's remarks were "shocking". Mr Sinha, the director of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), later said he regretted "any hurt" caused by his "inadvertent and unintended remarks". "I gave my opinion that betting should be legalised and that if the laws cannot be enforced that does not mean that laws should not be made. This is as erroneous as saying that if rape is inevitable one should lie back and enjoy it," he said in a statement on Wednesday. "I regret any hurt caused as the same was inadvertent and unintended. I reiterate my deep sense of regard and respect for women and commitment to gender issues." Women activists had criticised Mr Sinha's comments and demanded that he resign. "It is sickening that a man, who is in charge of several rape investigations, should use such an analogy. He should be prosecuted for degrading and insulting women," Ms Brinda Karat told The Hindu newspaper. Ranjana Kumari of the Delhi-based Centre for Social Research told The Hindustan Times newspaper that "such a senior police officer... should not have passed such a remark". "It is not acceptable and he should apologise for it. It has become a habit of people in senior positions to treat the issue of sexual assault lightly." Activist Kavita Krishnan told the BBC Hindi that if the head of India's main investigating agency "doesn't understand the difference between rape and enjoyment, then he should step down from his position". On Tuesday, Mr Sinha told The Hindustan Times that he was "using a proverb" to "make a point" about "how difficult it was to enforce a ban on betting". "[The reaction to the remark is] malicious propaganda, it's hitting below the belt, and it's unfair," he told the newspaper. The issue of sexual violence against women in India has been under intense scrutiny since the gang rape and murder of a student on a Delhi bus in December led to widespread protests. </body>

      <body>Negotiators in Brussels have clinched a deal on the 2014 EU budget after a night of hard talks, cutting spending by about 6% compared to 2013. Spending will total 135.5bn euros (£113.3; $181.3bn), or 0.5bn less than the Commission sought and 0.9bn short of the European Parliament's target. However, the budget is 0.5bn euros bigger than what austerity-conscious government leaders were demanding. It reflects stricter new terms agreed by EU leaders in February. There will be greater funding for economic growth, jobs, innovation and humanitarian aid, Lithuania's Deputy Finance Minister Algimantas Rimkunas said in a statement. His country currently holds the six-month rotating EU presidency. EU agencies dealing with migration, asylum and border control will also be strengthened, as will the European financial supervisory authorities, he added. About two-thirds of the budget will go on subsidies for farmers and on development projects in the EU's poorer regions, as in previous years. But the spending on such projects - called the "cohesion" budget - is being cut by about 7bn euros. Four governments voted against the compromise deal - the UK, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden, German ARD television reported. They wanted the EU to make deeper cuts. The Economic Secretary to the UK Treasury, Nicky Morgan, said the deal showed that Prime Minister David Cameron's influence was "genuinely bearing down on EU spending". "However, the final budget wasn't low enough to gain UK backing. When governments and families across Europe are taking difficult decisions to make savings, it would be wrong and irresponsible for the EU to not show similar restraint," he said. The deal was reached early on Tuesday after 16 hours of negotiation, and still requires final approval from the parliament and EU ministers next week. The UK Conservative leader in Europe, Richard Ashworth MEP, welcomed "what is an effective freeze of the EU budget - headline spend is still set to fall by 6%". He said that "alongside the historic 3.8% reduction which we have secured on the EU's long-term budget, this is further evidence of us bringing genuine discipline to EU spending". "It is particularly welcome that money has been switched away from less-useful budget headings to the important areas of research and development, education, training and jobs," he added. He called the budget "a step in the right direction". For the UK Liberal Democrats, George Lyon MEP said the budget deal boosted research and development funding by 200m euros compared to the original Commission proposal. "That means more money for UK universities, who currently receive more EU research funding than any other country," he said. There remains some opposition to the deal in the European Parliament, however. Helga Truepel MEP of the Greens said it was "a bad deal that will continue the perpetual cycle of EU under-budgeting". "With the budget to be reduced 6% compared with 2013, the outcome is not only devoid of ambition, it will also lead to a situation again next year where the EU is facing budget shortfalls compared with programmed spending." The deal, once signed off, should pave the way for the European Parliament to adopt the EU's long-term trillion-euro budget for 2014-2020. At the same time, the negotiators in Brussels agreed to allocate an extra 3.9bn euros to pay outstanding bills for 2013 incurred in cohesion projects. An additional 400.5m euros will also be spent from the EU "solidarity" fund to help areas of Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria and Romania which were hit by flooding this year. </body>

      <body>The Russian foreign ministry has demanded an apology from Poland after nationalist rioters attacked the Russian embassy in Warsaw on Monday. It conveyed the demand after summoning the Polish ambassador to Moscow, Wojciech Zajaczkowski. Poland's foreign ministry has expressed "deep regret" at the incident, blaming it on ultra-nationalists. Rioters threw fireworks at the embassy and burnt a rainbow-coloured arch symbolising tolerance. Polish police used rubber bullets to break up groups of masked youths from an ultra-nationalist march which attracted thousands of supporters. Four police officers were injured as the rioters set alight two cars and a guard's booth in front of the embassy, AFP news agency reports. Russia wants an official apology as well as measures to provide for "the security and normal operation of Russian diplomatic representations in Poland", the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement on its website. The Russian foreign ministry accused Polish police of "passivity and tardiness" in failing to prevent the rioters attacking its property. It called for the cost of damage to the embassy to be reimbursed and for the attackers to be prosecuted. A couple of hours before the Russians demanded an apology, the Polish foreign ministry posted a statement, in Russian, on its website which expressed "deep regret over the aggressive behaviour and incidents" outside the Russian embassy on Monday. Blaming the attack on ultra-nationalist groups, it added: "Behaviour of this kind with regard to a diplomatic mission merits absolute condemnation and does not correspond to a worthy celebration of Independence Day on 11 November." Poland's relations with Russia, which dominated it in Soviet times and under the tsars, have frequently been strained. </body>

      <body>Iran's foreign minister has blamed divisions between Western powers for the failure to agree a deal on its nuclear programme on Saturday. Mohammad Javad Zarif rejected US Secretary of State John Kerry's claim that Iran had been unable to accept the deal "at that particular moment". He said "no amount of spinning" could change what had happened in Geneva, but it could "further erode confidence". Mr Zarif appeared to blame France for "gutting over half" of a US draft deal. Representatives from Iran and the so-called P5+1 - the US, UK, France, Russia and China plus Germany - will meet again on 20 November. Iran stresses that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only, but world powers suspect it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons. Some reports said the latest talks failed because France had wanted to place tight restrictions on the heavy-water reactor being built at Arak; others that the Iranian government's insistence on formal recognition of its "right" to enrich uranium had been the major obstacle. During a visit to Abu Dhabi on Monday morning, Mr Kerry told reporters that the P5+1 had been "unified on Saturday when we presented our proposal to the Iranians". "The French signed off on it, we signed off on it, and everybody agreed it was a fair proposal," he added. "Iran couldn't take it at that particular moment." Later, Mr Zarif responded to the claim on Twitter. "No amount of spinning can change what happened within 5+1 in Geneva from 6pm Thursday to 5:45pm Saturday. But it can further erode confidence," he wrote. "Mr Secretary, was it Iran that gutted over half of US draft Thursday night? And publicly commented against it Friday morning?" Mr Zarif appeared to be referring to French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who on Friday morning cautioned in a statement that his country wanted a "credible agreement". At the end of the day's talks, Mr Fabius told France Inter radio that Paris could not accept a "fool's game". A Russian foreign ministry source was also quoted by the Interfax news agency on Tuesday as saying the failure was "not Iran's fault". "Iran was happy about the draft joint document, but since a decision during the negotiations is approved by consensus, it was impossible to reach a final agreement," the source said. Mr Zarif was nevertheless positive about the prospect of a breakthrough. "We are committed to constructive engagement. Interaction on equal footing key to achieve shared objectives," he wrote. Mr Kerry also told the BBC that negotiators had been "very, very close... extremely close" to agreeing a deal. "I think we were separated by four or five different formulations of a particular concept," he said. On Monday, Mr Fabius denied responsibility for the talks' failure and revealed that there had been several issues that "still need to be discussed with the Iranians", including the Arak facility. Tehran says the reactor is intended for the production of radioisotopes for medical purposes, but its spent fuel will contain plutonium suitable for use in nuclear weapons. Questions also remain over Iran's stockpile of uranium enriched to a medium level of purity, or 20%. Experts say it could be enriched to 90%, the level required for a nuclear bomb, in a relatively short time. </body>

      <body>A Lebanese Sunni Muslim cleric whose group is allied to Syria's government has been killed in the northern city of Tripoli, security sources say. Saad al-Din Ghiyyeh, an official in the Islamic Action Front, was shot in his car by masked gunmen on a motorcycle. He was rushed to hospital but died shortly afterwards. Soldiers were deployed to the area to prevent further violence in the city, which has seen deadly sectarian clashes aggravated by the conflict in Syria. Since 2012, at least 50 people have been killed in fighting between residents of the predominantly Alawite district of Jabal Muhsin and the neighbouring Sunni areas of Bab al-Tabbana and Qobbeh. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is an Alawite and members of the heterodox Shia sect dominate the government and security forces. Syria's majority Sunni community bore the brunt of the crackdown on dissent and is at the forefront of the armed revolt against the state. Ghiyyeh, who survived an attempt on his life several months ago, was reportedly close to the head of the IAF, which has good relations with the Syrian government and Lebanon's Shia Islamist movement, Hezbollah. Two IAF members are said to have been arrested on suspicion of involvement in the bombings of two Sunni mosques in Tripoli in August that killed at least 42 people and wounded hundreds more. </body>

      <title>NHS shake-up proposes two-tier A&amp;E</title>

      <body>A two-tier AandE system in England should be created as part of an overhaul of services, NHS chiefs say. The review by NHS England suggested the biggest 40 to 70 units - specialising in heart attacks, strokes and trauma - be called major emergency centres. It would leave the remaining 70 to 100 AandEs - known as emergency centres - to deal with less serious conditions. It also suggested changes to the way ambulance crews and the new 111 phone service work to "decongest" AandEs. Greater co-ordination between community services, such as GPs and pharmacists, would also help, it said. The measures have been put forward in response to the growing pressures on accident and emergency departments. Patient numbers have risen by 50% in the past decade and last winter the problems got so severe that the NHS missed its four-hour waiting time target. Extra money has been set aside to help the NHS through this winter and the next one. But this review aims to set out the long-term vision for the service. Many of the proposals are already in operation somewhere and in essence the review is calling for this to be formalised across the system. For example, there are already a number of AandE units that act as major centres in everything but name. But by setting a target of having between 40 and 70 major emergency centres it means this will have to be extended across the health service. NHS medical director Prof Sir Bruce Keogh, who led the review, said: "AandE is creaking at the seams. It is not broken, but it is struggling. "We need to change the way we work. But what we are suggesting here already exists in places, we are just trying to formalise it so it is available for everyone." The review said there also needed to be further changes to the system if pressure was going to be relieved. About 40% of people who attend AandE do not need treating there. What is more, the problems developed by a fifth of patients who are eventually admitted to hospital with emergency conditions could have been avoided with better and earlier treatment in the community. The review said key to tackling these problems was ensuring patients got access to the services that were best suited to them first time. To achieve this, 111, which has been beset by problems since it was launched in April to replace NHS Direct, will need to be much more responsive, giving patients direct phone access to doctors, nurses and other health professionals. Ambulance crews will need to treat more patients at the scene to reduce the number of patients transferred to hospital. Meanwhile, there needs to be greater co-ordination between GPs, pharmacists and the network of minor injury clinics and walk-in centres to give patients 24/7 access to care outside of hospital. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said Labour welcomed Sir Bruce's report but deplored "the government's attempt to avoid presenting it to Parliament and abdicate all responsibility for the crisis in AandE". "Ministers said this report would have lessons for the immediate winter, as well as the longer term," he added. "But they are failing to act and their response remains 'crisis, what crisis'? They are forcing AandEs to go into winter with too few nurses, doctors and beds." He said the prime minister had "made it harder to get a GP appointment, closed NHS walk-in centres and scrapped NHS Direct, leaving people with no alternative but to go to AandE". Patients Association chief executive Katherine Murphy said the review had presented a "promising vision". "At present there is genuine confusion amongst some patients, who then opt for AandE as a safe default option," she added. College of Emergency Medicine president Dr Clifford Mann welcomed the proposals, although he said NHS chiefs would need to be careful the reorganisation of AandEs did not lead to "detrimental" increased journey times. He also said: "Any plan to provide emergency care must be based upon an adequate number of appropriately skilled clinicians and on this matter the review is disappointingly silent." The changes will now go out to consultation and the review team will spend the next six months looking at the cost and staffing implications before producing another report in the spring. It is likely to take three to five years before the overhaul is completed. </body>

      <title>UK aid flight lands in Philippines</title>
      <description>The first plane carrying humanitarian aid from the UK to the Philippines lands at Cebu airport.</description>

      <body>A plane carrying humanitarian aid from the UK has arrived in the Philippines. It landed at midnight local time (16:00 GMT), carrying almost 9,000 shelter kits for families made homeless by Friday's devastating typhoon. The UK is also sending an emergency team of 12 medical staff at the request of the Philippine Department of Health. The stricken country's president has said the estimated death toll of 10,000 was too high, but the UN estimates 11 million have been affected in some way. President Benigno Aquino says the number of people killed is more likely to be up to 2,500. More than half a million people have been displaced. The UK kits that arrived at Cebu airport contain plastic sheeting, rope and rope tensioners. They were flown to the Philippines from UK stores in Dubai. Officials from the Department for International Development (DfID) said each kit would keep a family of five sheltered. It will be down to charity World Vision - one of 14 aid organisations that make up the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) - to distribute the kits. The other charities are Action Aid, Age International, British Red Cross, Cafod, Care International, Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Islamic Relief, Merlin, Oxfam, Plan UK, Save the Children and Tearfund. While several countries have deployed ships and aircraft to help, many people are still without food, water and shelter. Aid agencies have warned the security situation is deteriorating and there are reports of looting, as those preparing to enter the disaster zone face logistical hold-ups. "There's a lot of work going on behind the scenes to make sure that when we're bringing aircraft in, they're the right aircraft, that the runway can accommodate them, that there's things like fuel so we can get them back out there," said Claire, from the British Red Cross. "If we try and rush in too quickly, without any of this pre-planning, then we're going to have massive bottlenecks where aircraft are stuck on the ground and that's not going to help anyone." John Cordell, from the charity ShelterBox, which is delivering emergency shelters and supplies, added: "It sounds as though the security conditions are getting a little bit worse. There've been reports of attacks on food convoys and looting of aid. "I think that is deterring a lot of aid agencies from getting in there." DEC chairman Salah Saeed likened the destruction in the city of Tacloban, which was particularly badly hit, to that seen after the devastating tsunami of 2004. "There is currently no food, water or electricity. We can only imagine how much worse the situation will be for families living in towns and remote villages," he said. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said the 12-strong UK medical team consisted of "volunteer surgeons, doctors and paramedics who are expert at operating in emergency situations such as this". The team will be led by professor of international emergency medicine Anthony Redmond, of Manchester University. Later Ms Greening is due to host a meeting to discuss the international response to the ongoing disaster. She will be joined in person or via video link by representatives from UN agencies, donors and other organisations. The meeting is expected to focus particularly on how to help women and girls affected by what the Philippine president declared a national calamity earlier this week. Meanwhile, British ship HMS Daring, a Type-45 destroyer deployed near Singapore, is due to arrive at the disaster area on Saturday. The ship's captain, Angus Essenhigh, told the BBC its mission would be to provide "life-saving assistance" such as water, shelter and food. A DEC appeal was broadcast on Tuesday evening, and the committee said £1.5m had been donated so far. The UK government, which has already pledged £10m in aid, said it would match donations to the appeal pound for pound up to £5m. It said its overall contribution would help to get food, aid and shelter to a total of 800,000 people. The UN has launched an appeal for $301m (£190m) to help relief efforts in typhoon-hit areas. </body>

      <title>Chinese leaders unveil reforms</title>
      <description>China's leaders end a crucial meeting by announcing a series of economic reforms aimed at overhauling the world's second largest economy.</description>

      <body>China's leaders have unveiled a series of reforms aimed at overhauling its economy over the next decade. In a statement issued after a closed-door summit, they promised the free market would play a bigger role. A new committee will oversee internal security to guard against social unrest, and farmers will be given more property rights over their land. A BBC correspondent says the leaders will now have to persuade officials below them to implement the reforms. The so-called Third Plenum talks began in Beijing on Friday, and ended with a brief communique outlining areas that had been agreed on. The BBC's Celia Hatton in Beijing says the reforms could carry enormous importance - a more complete list of changes to the economy and the social sector is expected to be released in the coming days, or even weeks. Details of what was agreed are still emerging. The Communist Party leaders said markets would be allowed to play a leading role. State ownership would remain a pillar of the economy. "The core issue is to straighten out the relationship between government and the market, allowing the market to play a decisive role in allocating resources and improving the government's role," the statement said, Reuters news agency reports. Our correspondent says the party is vowing to carry out deep reforms across the economy and the government to reach a "new stage of development". A lengthy television story heading China's flagship state newscast showed rows of Communist Party officials, including Chairman Xi Jinping, sitting at long tables studying paper documents in front of them. The report contained a long list of vague party pledges - from a plan to create a modern military to one that encourages foreign investment in China's coastal cities, our correspondent adds. Other changes include promises to institute stronger systems to check corruption. Ahead of the meeting another area expected to be discussed was China's household registration system. The meeting was being closely watched after senior Communist Party official Yu Zhengsheng said last month that "unprecedented" economic and social reforms would be discussed at the meeting. Analysts did not expect any political reforms to be on the agenda. How successful the reforms turn out to be remains to be seen. It will take time to assess their impact. And where economic or social reforms are agreed, local officials and groups with vested interests may be reluctant to implement them, correspondents say. Third Plenums refer to the third time new leaders of China lead a plenary session of the Central Committee. They generally take place a year after new leaders take office, after they have established their power base. Previous Third Plenums have had a major impact on China's development. At the Third Plenum in 1978, former leader Deng Xiaoping announced the opening-up of China's economy, spearheading major market-oriented reforms. In 1993's Third Plenum, former leader Zhu Rongji announced the "socialist market economy" and dismantled a large part of China's state-owned sector. Security was tight in Beijing for the meeting, with tensions higher than usual in the wake of an incident on 28 October in Tiananmen Square and bomb blasts in the north of the country days after. Five people were killed in what Chinese officials called a "terrorist attack" incited by extremists from the western region of Xinjiang when a car drove through crowds and burst into flames near an entrance to the Forbidden City. Less than a week later, a series of small blasts killed at least one person outside a provincial office of the ruling Communist Party in Shanxi province. </body>

      <title>US airlines settle merger suit</title>
      <description>American Airlines and US Airways settle an anti-trust suit, paving the way for a merger which would create the world's biggest airline.</description>

      <body>American Airlines and US Airways have settled an anti-trust suit with US regulators, paving the way for their proposed merger to be finalised. The merger would create the world's largest airline. As part of the agreement, which must still be approved by a judge, the airlines will give up slots at several US airports. The two companies argued the consolidation was necessary to their survival. The US Justice Department had sued to stop the $11bn (£6.9bn) merger in August, arguing it would reduce competition and result in higher prices for consumers. "This agreement has the potential to shift the landscape of the airline industry...[and] ensures airline passengers will see more competition on nonstop and connecting routes throughout the country," said Attorney General Eric Holder in a statement. The two airlines will each give up 57 slots to low-cost carrier airlines at Ronald Reagan International Airport in Washington DC and 34 slots at LaGuardia Airport (LGA) in New York City. The companies say this will result in 44 fewer daily departures at Reagan and 12 fewer daily departures at LGA - a fraction of the close to 400 daily flights that the airlines operate from those two airports. "They dominated Reagan Airport, that's why they had the Department of Justice concerned," Ray Neidl, an airline analyst at Nexa Capital, told the BBC, who said that giving up slots at the airport was an unsurprising part of the agreement. "It was better than litigating," he added. An additional two slots each at Boston Logan International, Chicago O'Hare International, Dallas Love Field, Los Angeles International and Miami International airports will be released. The slots will be given to low cost airlines like JetBlue and Southwest. "This agreement allows us to take the final steps in creating the new American Airlines," said Tom Horton, head of American Airline's parent corporation, AMR, in a statement. The company now says it expects the merger to be finalised in December 2013. AMR Corp has been in a bankruptcy restructuring for two years and it is hoped that once the merger is finalised, the company will be able to complete its turnaround. Shares in US Airways traded 3.5% higher before being halted on pending news. They were lower once the specifics of the deal had been announced. The anti-trust trial had been scheduled to start later this month. The US Justice Department had been joined by the attorneys-general of Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Tennessee, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, but all have agreed to the proposed settlement. </body>

      <title>PFA to discuss homegrown Euro quota</title>
      <description>The Professional Footballers' Association is to discuss proposals calling for European teams to use more homegrown players.</description>

      <body>The Professional Footballers' Association plans to send proposals to Uefa calling for European teams to use at least three "homegrown" players in starting XIs. The union will discuss the issue at its annual general meeting on Wednesday amid concerns that BT Sport's record £897m European TV deal could increase pressure on managers to use ready-made players rather than youngsters. BBC Sport has revealed the number of English under-21 players in the Premier League has dropped to a new low. But European Union laws have prevented previous attempts to introduce quota systems. The PFA hopes a Europe-wide plan for the inclusion of three players educated by the club between 16 and 21, regardless of nationality, would avoid potential legal problems. And some of Europe's big five leagues have also seen a fall in the use of young players over the past eight years. The PFA says that, in England, five out of six players who join clubs full-time at 16 are out of the game by 21. Chesterfield defender Ritchie Humphreys will officially become the new PFA chairman at the meeting, replacing outgoing chairman Clarke Carlisle, who has retired from playing. Humphreys will also join the Football Association commission attempting to improve the fortunes of the England team. And a number of other new appointments are expected to be announced. BT's record-breaking three-year deal to show all Champions League and Europa League matches from 2015 will form a backdrop to discussions. Although more money being fed into the game is thought to be welcomed, there is also a concern that it could increase the disparity between player earnings in the Premier League and Championship compared to Leagues One and Two. Humphreys, 35, spent most of his career playing for Hartlepool, having left Sheffield Wednesday when he was 23 in order to gain more playing time. Other issues to be discussed at the PFA's headquarters in Manchester will include player safety after a recent spate of concussions such as for Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, who was allowed to continue playing against Everton despite being knocked unconscious. The lack of black managers in the top four divisions will also be high on the agenda. Only three non-white bosses are employed and there is a frustration from the PFA that an assembled group of already qualified coaches have not gained recognition from the Premier League and Football League. </body>

      <body>England's bowlers were frustrated on the first day of their final Ashes warm-up match against an Australian Invitational XI in Sydney. Stuart Broad took three wickets and Steven Finn two as England reduced the hosts to 93-5. But an unbroken sixth-wicket stand of 178 between Ryan Carters (94no) and Peter Nevill (76no) helped them close on 271-5. The first Test against Australia in Brisbane starts on 21 November. England will hope their bowlers pose more of a threat at the Gabba than they did in the second half of the day at the SCG. With James Anderson rested and Chris Tremlett left out, Finn and Boyd Rankin were given the opportunity to stake their claim for the third seamer's spot in England's Test side. However, other than the superb Broad, the tourists' attack struggled after captain Alastair Cook won the toss. Broad, bowling a probing line and getting the ball to nip off the seam, dismissed Aaron Finch and Callum Ferguson cheaply before returning to remove Ben Rohrer with the help of a fine catch at backward point by Michael Carberry. Finn accounted for Kurtis Patterson and opener Ed Cowan, who was dropped by Australia during this summer's 3-0 Ashes defeat in England, for 51 shortly after lunch. However, Finn proved expensive at times and Rankin, despite being slightly more economical, could not find the right line and length to truly threaten the batsmen. Carters and Nevill batted cautiously before growing in confidence, and 23-year-old Carters, who had a first-class average of just 20.75 before the game, went on to the highest score of his career. With rain forecast for the final two days of the four-day match, England will hope to take the final five wickets quickly on the second day to give their batsmen some time at the crease. Kevin Pietersen will be hoping to find form after having an injection in a knee, while Jonny Bairstow, who was tidy behind the stumps on the opening day, will also be keen to impress in the absence of injured wicketkeeper Matt Prior. </body>

      <title>Tendulkar is the greatest - Lara</title>

      <body>West Indies legend Brian Lara believes Sachin Tendulkar should be remembered as the greatest cricketer in history. The 40-year-old will start his 200th and final Test in his hometown of Mumbai against West Indies on Thursday. The Indian is the highest runscorer in international cricket, with 15,847 runs in 199 Tests and 18,426 runs in 463 one-day internationals. "Tendulkar has had the greatest cricket career of anyone who has ever played the game," said Lara. Lara, 44, and Tendulkar have similar records, with Lara averaging just under 53 in his 131 Tests and Tendulkar a fraction over 53. Tendulkar, though, made his Test debut aged only 16 and will end his career having played 69 more matches than Lara. Tendulkar last year became the only batsman in history to score 100 international centuries, and he will become the first man to play 200 Tests. "The impact he has had on his game, his country, the rest of the world is incredible," added Lara, who scored 11,953 Test runs. "His stats speak for themselves," continued Lara. "I don't think there is any 16-year-old who is going to embark on the sort of career that Sachin Tendulkar has had and walk away from the game at 40 with such great achievements. "He's the Muhammad Ali and the Michael Jordan of cricket. You think of the great boxers and basketball players, but if you were to talk about the game then you would have to talk about Sachin." </body>

      <title>Composer Sir John Tavener dies at 69</title>
      <description>Sir John Tavener, one of the leading British composers of the past 50 years, dies at the age of 69.</description>

      <body>Tributes have been paid to Sir John Tavener, a leading British composer of the past 50 years, who has died at 69. Fellow composer John Rutter told BBC Radio 3 that Sir John, known for his spiritual music, "was absolutely touched by genius at every point". In 1992 The Protecting Veil topped the classical charts for several months and in 1997 his Song For Athene was played at the funeral of Princess Diana. He suffered ill health for much of his life, and died at his home in Dorset. "He could bring an audience to a deep silence which is a very rare gift," Rutter added. "He believed that music was for everybody and was a prayer." Sir John made his name with the avant-garde oratorio The Whale, which was released by The Beatles on their Apple label in 1968. He went on to become one of the few contemporary composers to find wide acclaim beyond the classical world. Sir John's other well-known works included his setting of William Blake's poem The Lamb and A New Beginning, which was chosen to see in the new century at the end of 1999 in the Millennium Dome in London. He was nominated for the prestigious Mercury Prize twice - in 1992 and 1997 - and was knighted in 2000. Sir John also won a Grammy in 2002 for best classical contemporary composition for Lamentations and Praises, recorded with San Francisco male choral ensemble Chanticleer. Grammy president Neil Portnow said the musician "strived to create compositions that were noble, magnificent and inspirational". Having started his musical career as a teenage organist at a Presbyterian church in London, he converted to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1977 and once said that "my way towards God has been to write music". James Rushton, managing director of Sir John's publisher Chester Music, described him as "one of the unique and most inspired voices in music of the last 50 years". "His large body of work... is one of the most significant contributions to classical music in our times," he said. "For all of those fortunate enough to have known him, John was a man of strong beliefs, huge personal warmth, loyalty and humour. He will be much missed." Sir John was also known for his imposing 6ft 6in (198 cm) frame and his flowing hair. As well as music, one of his great passions was luxury cars. He had suffered a stroke in 1979, and in 1990 was diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome, a hereditary condition that can cause heart defects. In 2007 he suffered a heart attack that caused him to spend six months in intensive care. He defied doctors who did not expect him to return to work, and in his last months described composing as a welcome distraction from constant pain. Sir John was heard on BBC Radio 4's Start the Week on Monday in an interview recorded on 31 October. He recounted how his heart attack had left him unable to "sense the idea of God any more, [and] I couldn't sense any music". He added: "It was only after being nursed by my wife back into some state of health that the music and a different kind of faith started to come back." Sir John premiered three works at the Manchester International Festival this summer, The premiere of his latest work, Three Shakespeare Sonnets, is scheduled to take place at Southwark Cathedral on Friday. Others paying tribute included cellist and collaborator Steven Isserlis, who remembered the composer as "full of humour, very funny". "He's unique," Isserlis told Radio 3. "Classical music has fractured into all these completely different languages and voices and he had his own voice. He wasn't writing to be popular - he was writing the music he had to write." Gill Graham, his publisher of 11 years, said he was a "true inspiration" to her. "He was a gentle, funny, kind, strong-willed and beautiful man. I will miss him terribly," she added. Composer and conductor Sir Peter Maxwell Davies said Sir John's contribution to spiritual music was "immense", adding his death "is a great loss to the world of spiritual music". Soprano Patricia Rozario said: "He really connected with our humanity, and people from all walks of life and different areas. "Once he told me there were a whole group of youngsters who listened to his music while at a rave party, and he was quite touched by that, that even young people connected with his music." Radio 3 controller Roger Wright described Sir John as "of one of our most powerful and individual voices". A Clarence House spokesman said: "The Prince of Wales was saddened to hear of the death of John Tavener." He was widely reported to be Prince Charles's favourite composer. </body>

      <title>Catching Fire 'had minor cuts'</title>
      <description>The director of the latest Hunger Games film says he "cut a couple frames" to secure a PG-13 rating in the US.</description>

      <body>The director of the latest Hunger Games film has said he had to make some very minor changes to secure a PG-13 rating in the US. "We didn't have too many issues with the ratings board," Francis Lawrence told the BBC. "We had to go back and we cut a couple frames, adjusted some volume, took a little bit of blood out, but it was very little that we had to do." The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is out in the UK on 21 November. The film's star, Jennifer Lawrence, and other cast members walked the red carpet on Monday night in London's Leicester Square at the film's world premiere. It is released in the US on 22 November. Catching Fire is the second film of the franchise based on the best-selling trilogy of novels by Suzanne Collins. It is set in a society where adolescents fight to the death on live TV. In this latest instalment, last year's victors Katniss (Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) become targets of the ruling elite after they help spark a rebellion. They are shocked when it is announced that the next Hunger Games will feature victors from previous years. The cast includes Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz, Donald Sutherland and Philip Seymour Hoffman. In the US, the film is rated PG-13 for "intense sequences of violence and action, some frightening images, thematic elements, a suggestive situation and language". "We always aim in America for the PG-13," said Francis Lawrence, who is not related to Jennifer. "You're always aware of those guidelines so whenever you get into a scene or sequence that could be tricky, you try and stay vigilant, you try and shoot some options, have an idea ahead of time so you don't get stuck." He assumed that Gary Ross, director of the first film The Hunger Games, may have had a harder challenge. "It must have been a different ball game because kids killing kids is always really tough no matter how much you show. "Fortunately, I didn't have to deal with that because this time in there's far less human-on-human violence, the arena is more of a threat and the tributes [fighters] are now adults - the youngest that are in there are Katniss and Peeta. That alone makes it a completely different ball game." In the UK, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire has been rated 12A after being passed uncut by censors. The BBFC report said the film contained "moderate violence and threat, and infrequent strong language". Cuts were made to the original Hunger Games film in 2012 in order to avoid a 15 rating in UK cinemas, which would have potentially decreased box office takings. The first instalment of the franchise made £27.2m at the UK box office, and nearly $700 million (£441m) worldwide. Most early reviews of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire have been glowing. The Telegraph's Robbie Collins observed: "Set against many intellectually bloodless teenage fantasies, this is as juicy as a cut of sirloin... Is it too soon to say I can't wait for the next one?" The Hollywood Reporter's Todd McCarthy called it "a safe, serviceable, carefully crafted action drama". He went on: "As before, Jennifer Lawrence is the superb centre of it all and the massive success of this Lionsgate release is as certain as the turning of the Earth." In a three-star review, The Guardian's Paul MacInnes said: "There's never quite the sense of satisfaction that the first film provided. You can feel the franchise dynamic chugging beneath, with the result that Catching Fire is not quite a full course, more of an amuse bouche, making its mammoth audience hungry for future, meatier instalments." </body>

      <title>Mammogram finds US reporter's cancer</title>
      <description>Good Morning America's Amy Robach will have a double mastectomy this week, after a mammogram she underwent on the show found breast cancer.</description>

      <body>Good Morning America's Amy Robach has revealed she will have a double mastectomy this week, a month after undergoing a mammogram on the show. The 40-year-old correspondent discovered she had breast cancer after reluctantly agreeing to have a screening filmed for the ABC show. She said GMA anchor Robin Roberts had persuaded her that if the story saved one life, it would be worth it. "It never occurred to me that life would be mine," said Robach. Producers chose Robach to cover the mammogram story because it is recommended that women at the age of 40 regularly check for breast cancer. During Monday's programme, and in a blog post following the show, Robach said doctors had not yet determined what stage the cancer had progressed to, or whether it had spread. The original story, which was part of the GMA Goes Pink breast cancer awareness day, featured Robach emerging from her on-air mammogram, before telling colleagues that it hurt much less than she thought it would. A few weeks later she was told she had cancer, after returning for what she thought would be some follow-up images. Robach said that her husband, actor Andrew Shue, had returned from his work trip that night and her parents had also caught a flight to New York to join her. "We started gearing up for a fight," she said, as she revealed that she would have both breasts removed this Thursday, followed by reconstructive surgery. Robach joined ABC in 2012 from NBC, where she was a Weekend Today host. She frequently filled in as a presenter on ABC's top-rated morning show GMA, while host Roberts was fighting a serious blood and bone marrow disease. Robach said that with a full-time job and two children she had always found reasons to put off having a mammogram herself. However a doctor told her that the test had saved her life. "I can only hope my story will inspire every woman who hears it to get a mammogram, to take a self-exam," said Robach. "No excuses. It is the difference between life and death." </body>

      <title>Who shot Nasiruddin Haqqani?</title>
      <description>Mystery of the murdered militant - and the cover-up</description>

      <body>At first it appeared as if two men had been injured in a gun attack at a bread shop in the eastern suburbs of Pakistan's capital, Islamabad - just a routine shooting, a senseless crime in a large city. But eyewitnesses noticed a number of aberrations. Some told local press that the police who arrived at the crime scene collected bullet casings and other evidence and then washed the area down to clean away the blood stains. One of the injured was taken to a nearby house, witnesses said. Later, the injured man - or was he dead by then? - was put in a vehicle and driven away in the presence of senior police officers. Local police registered a report saying unknown assailants on a motorbike injured a naan-bread maker at a suburban market. When confronted by the reporters, they denied there had been a second injured man. The capital's main hospitals also reported only one casualty from the scene - one Mohammad Farooq, the naan maker. But by mid-afternoon on Monday rumours were swirling that the second mystery man hit in the attack was in fact Nasiruddin Haqqani, a key leader of the so-called Haqqani network, considered one of the deadliest Afghan Taliban groups fighting Western forces in Afghanistan. Confirming the rumours, a relative of Mr Haqqani told BBC his body had been spirited from Islamabad to the town of Miranshah in North Waziristan - roughly six hours drive across two provinces and one federal tribal territory, all dotted with heavily-manned military and police checkpoints. There are obvious reasons for this cover-up. For years, Pakistan has been accused by the West of backing the Haqqani network to counter the influence of arch-rival India in Afghanistan, a charge it denies. So the idea that some of the group's key leaders were freely moving around in Islamabad - and even had a permanent home in the city, as has become apparent following the attack - could cause the country some embarrassment, a reminder of what it faced in 2011 when al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden was killed by the Americans in a Pakistani city. Nasiruddin was the son of Jalaluddin Haqqani, a veteran of the Afghan war against the Soviets in the 1980s who then set up the Haqqani network to fight the Americans in the post-9/11 era. He was also the elder brother of Sirajuddin Haqqani, who heads the Haqqani network these days. The Haqqanis belong to the Jadran tribe which is a native of eastern Afghanistan's Loya, or greater, Paktia region, and pledge allegiance to the Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar. But they have their main sanctuary in Pakistan's tribal territory of Waziristan and maintain operational independence from the Afghan Taliban. The group is known for launching spectacular attacks against Western and Indian targets in Afghanistan. And it is known to have played a prominent role in seeking to bring the anti-Pakistan militant groups in the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) alliance to the dialogue table with Islamabad. Nasiruddin Haqqani was not central to the group's military operations, but had a vital role as a fundraiser and emissary who frequently travelled to the sheikhdoms of the Middle East to raise cash, and also, according to some reports, to look after his family business there. He also played a part in last year's efforts to set up a Taliban office in Doha for peace talks with the United States, although the Haqqani network was not a direct interlocutor in those talks. In addition, he was understood to be the group's main contact person for pro-Taliban elements in Pakistan, and was frequently seen moving around in Islamabad. According to local residents, some family members of Nasiruddin Haqqani had been living in the Shahpur area on Islamabad's eastern outskirts for well over four years. He was apparently using this base to organise financial and logistic;al support for his group and the Afghan Taliban. So there were a number of groups who could have wanted to see him dead. Analysts believe his assassination has dealt a blow to the group's fundraising activities, because they think Nasiruddin was the only Haqqani free to exploit his father's vast Middle Eastern contacts. The others are either dead, or engaged in operational matters. Some quarters also suggest he was Islamabad's main link to the TTP leadership in its recent peace overtures to that group. For these circles, the obvious suspects behind his killing would be either the Americans or the Afghans. But others point to growing unease within the wider Taliban community in the North Waziristan sanctuary as the time for Nato's drawdown in Afghanistan gets nearer. This unease is partly due to a fluid situation in Pakistan, where the political and military establishments are putting up a half-hearted battle against some right-wing politicians who appear bent on exploiting the anti-American feelings in the country to push it into international isolation. Tribal sources say there is a clear split within the TTP, with some ethnic Mehsud commanders accusing the Haqqanis of toeing the Pakistani line. The Haqqanis have also faced opposition from some Punjabi Taliban groups that were initially hosted and feted by them but have now sunk their own roots in the area and consider the Haqqanis to be as foreign to Waziristan as they are themselves. Analysts feel 10 years after it was created, the Waziristan sanctuary is readying for change, with dozens of groups realigning amid shifts in relations and tactical priorities concerning Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. For a while, there may be no clear friends or enemies in the area, they say. </body>

      <body>The faded photograph on Yineth Trujillo's book case tells the whole story. She stands at the back, looking tall and broad-shouldered next to her younger brothers and sisters. In the photo she is 17 and has long dark hair. She's muscular, unsmiling, almost masculine. Her eyes are swollen. "I had been crying all day," she tells me. "It was the first time I had seen my family in years. They had given me up for dead." She is one of thousands of child soldiers to have demobilised in the last 15 years. Most of them were recruited by Colombia's biggest left-wing guerrilla groups - the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) and the National Liberation Army (ELN). Two years before the picture was taken, Ms Trujillo had ceased to be a child soldier with the Farc, the largest of Colombia's left-wing guerrilla groups Today, at 27, she is a sophisticated woman with a radiant smile and two young, happy daughters - a far cry from the little 12-year-old girl who was brainwashed by the guerrillas and made to act as an informant. "They gave the boys lots of training in handling explosives and me in intelligence gathering," she recalls. "The Farc really wanted to recruit [girls] for this reason, because no-one suspects a little girl. A little girl can transport money, weapons, drugs much more easily." She said she was made to perform abortions on other female recruits, who were not allowed to have children, in order to keep them focused on their guerrilla duties. "This was the thing that scarred me most," she explains. "The women [recruits] think that if they get pregnant, then they're lucky and they will be free. They are mistaken. It doesn't matter how long a woman has been pregnant. It could be two or eight months. Either way, she will get an abortion," Ms Trujillo said. Her resilience is similar to that of many other former combatants I spoke to at a government-run rehabilitation programme, based at a farm in western Colombia. Government figures suggest that the rate of desertion by combatants rose by 40% in the first six months of this year, compared with the same period last year. The rise coincided with the start of peace talks between the Farc and the government, though it is impossible to say if there is a link. Some of the demobilised children are taken to the farm. Its exact location is kept secret to protect them from the rebel factions they recently deserted. We were the first foreign journalists to be allowed there to talk to the children. We have changed their names to protect their identities. Carlos, who wears a purple T-shirt, told us how - at the age of 15 - he spent up to five hours in battle at a time, seeing his friends shot dead next to him. Juan, now 16, showed us where he was shot and injured in the head while he was with the Farc. From the age of 12, he was a unit commander, meaning he and his subordinates were tasked with guard duties. Yolanda, a delicate girl with long black hair, also 16, described how she fell asleep while on guard duty one night. Her punishment was being made to carry heavy rifles during the next patrol. To help ease the trauma of what they have experienced, the children may now spend several months on the farm, until they have shown proper signs of recovery and safe homes are found for them. They grow vegetables, feed the animals and learn to trust strangers again. The rehabilitation centre's child welfare psychologist, Carolina Maya Rivera, says many of the child soldiers had little choice about being recruited. "They were led to take up these weapons and uniforms not because they wanted to, but because there was no other option," she says. I ask her how difficult reforming those who were trained to kill could be. "These kids are neither victims nor murderers. People are not good or bad. This is just something that happens to them," she explains. The experiences of many of those on the farm are so raw that they are still focused on their day-to-day lives, though they seem a determined bunch. One older ex-combatant, Leonardo, who was drafted by the Farc at the age of 11 after being tortured by the army, explains that he would like to go into politics. He says that in 20 years' time, he would like to be president. The children's stories paint a picture of brutality in Colombia 50 years since its civil conflict began. The government accuses the guerrillas of continuing to recruit children, though over the years all sides have used brutal tactics. As well as trying to end the war through dialogue, the government continues to try to defeat the guerrillas on the battlefield. The Farc have lost many members, but the military believes they are increasingly dependent on a malleable and ever younger fighting force. In Meta province, we saw a military hearts-and-minds campaign in full swing: a marching band paraded around town and a football match was organised for the town's young. Bicycles and stereos were given away as prizes. War-weary rank-and-file soldiers in T-shirts and baseball caps handed out balloons. Maj Armando del Rio, who runs the campaign, says it is squarely aimed at preventing the recruitment of children. "These rural areas are prime targets for the illegal armed groups. It is rather ironic but we know that what we are doing is for the good of the Colombian kids," he said. But not everyone shares Maj del Rio's view, Jose Luis Campo, leader of a charity for former child soldiers, Benposta, says he has seen cases in which children have been used as informants by the military. "There have been many cases [...] of boys and girls that were threatened by the Farc because they found out they were doing intelligence operations on the payroll of the army [or] the police," Mr Campo says. Deputy Minister of Defence Jorge Bedoya denies the allegation: "No, it is illegal, it is prohibited, in Colombia and by our own internal framework, using minors in the way you mentioned." Back in her home near the capital, Bogota, Ms Trujillo is now writing a book about her experiences. She is also helping to rehabilitate other ex-combatants with the government's reintegration agency. She clearly is pleased with the help the authorities have given her to adjust to normal life, but says more needs to be done. "The more people demobilise, the bigger the need for a better education, for more houses, and more business so it will be easier to get a job," she says. "Everybody has to work for this, not just the government or the Farc, but all Colombians." On the wall is a framed picture showing her with her two young daughters, all of them smiling. It encapsulates her dream for a fulfilling family life, a dream which now looks achievable. </body>

      <description>Your stories of sibling bullying - and the lasting pain</description>

      <body>A recent BBC News Magazine article asked when scrapping between siblings becomes bullying. Readers responded with stories of being bullied - as well as tales of being the bully. Deborah, US: My two sons (ages 17 and 16) got into such a fight in the car just this morning, I pulled them into the counsellor's office at school. It was a first for the school - which is a top-ranked high school in the US. Both my boys are well-known and well-liked at school, but privately we have a real problem. My oldest is a bully, my youngest is borderline autistic. It's beyond sibling rivalry - today the oldest was snarling in the youngest's ear like a psycho - "I'm going to kill you. I'm going to destroy your (new French) horn, I'm going to destroy ..." He couldn't get further because I ordered him to shut up or face criminal charges. I've had him sent to jail for three days once for stabbing his brother in the stomach with a pen. His temper is psychotic, he's even slapped me across the face, and his brother has been in terror, shaking all over, that John's going to do something to him. We have broken doors, walls, and furniture, and just this weekend the oldest smashed some of my favourite art while he was in a fit that I wasn't doing enough to help him apply to college. I've been trying to correct his behaviour all these years, and nothing seems to work - it just gets worse. Louise, UK: We bullied each other very badly. I had aggressive physical fights with my brother all the way into our mid-teens. He told me I was fat and ugly until after I left home and dropped to six stone, when he seemed to realise the effect of his words and wouldn't shut up about how thin I was. I was scared of him physically and so I made comments to try and dent his confidence. I suppose it was a self-perpetuating circle of his physically punishing me for my comments and me making comments to punish him for physically beating me. For my part, I said some absolutely unforgiveable things to him which even as an adult that I feel incapable of repeating because I still feel so ashamed. My brother and I now have very little contact. He's struggling with life and has struggled with drug problems, relationship and mental health issues. I feel responsible for this and I don't think I'll ever be able to let that guilt go but I don't know how to apologise or make up for the things I said and did. Kristina, US: As a young child I remember my brother (the middle child) beating me up, but in a playful manner. It was rarely, if ever, malicious. He would pick on me and call me names sometimes, as I was a chubby child. I had "dead arms" from my brother punching me in the same spot repeatedly. It could be deemed abuse by most researchers, but it made me a stronger person and built my character to withstand the real negative comments in school. Bullying is never okay. But you make the decision as to whether or not you let it bother you. Of course it stings for the moment, but if you don't react to it people generally stop and life goes on. Today, I am 24. I have a wonderful relationship with my brothers. Parents need to teach their kids to stand up for themselves in situations where it calls for it. They need to use their words and, as a last resort, actions. I always fought back against my brothers, I never let them win. Caroline, UK: I have hardly seen my sister in 30 years and I prefer it that way - as an adult I do not choose to live a life full of violence, rage, jealousy and bitterness. She is still the same jealous, deceitful, cruel bully as ever, but less violent than when we were growing up. As a young child she attacked me constantly, [she would] sneak up behind me and push me down flights of stairs, down concrete steps, off walls and even a bunk bed. My hearing has always been terrible, I had no idea she was behind me and at three years younger than her, I was a lot smaller and she was a lot stronger. On one occasion she slammed a glass door into me and my hand went through the glass. I had to remove the piece of glass that was sticking out of my wrist and then spent hours in A and E waiting for the deep lacerations to be stitched up. She broke, destroyed or sold most of my things and was always up to manipulative, devious, tricks and lies, including ripping up my books to ensure I got another beating from my mother, who she took after. My mother knew what my sister was doing and what was happening to me. However she preferred to drink with her friends and couldn't be bothered to deal with such a disturbed child who was such a nightmare to deal with; it was easier to target me. My childhood was a living hell because of this; I spent most of the time in a state of extreme terror and fear and suffered from chronic depression, anxiety, stress and insomnia, which I still suffer from as an adult. I regularly shook from head to foot with fear at the prospect of another beating, or another onslaught and if I wet my pants with terror I got another beating. I was very lucky not to have been killed, or permanently injured by the violent, relentless and persistent attacks; I would now describe their behaviour as psychotic. Kathy, UK: I was bullied by my older brother throughout my childhood. He was eight years older and put a lot of energy into bullying. He drew scary pictures on the wall near my bed when I was three years old. He used a soldering iron to write a horrible message - "you are a fat pig" - on a school pencil case my Mum made for me. At age 11 I remember wishing that I hadn't been born. I stopped speaking to him at home for two years. My parents did very little to stop it. Christmas was always ruined by it. I was also bullied at school but it wasn't as bad as the bullying at home. I suffered from depression for many years and have experienced workplace bullying and domestic violence. I know it is all connected to my childhood. Anne, UK: I am the eldest of five. The sister immediately after me (11 months younger) went through a phase of trying to boss all of us. According to my other siblings, she was particularly vicious with me. I can remember the feeling of helplessness because I was not believed and because I did not know how to defend myself. I tried to get my parents to help, but they just called me a drama queen... until my mother overheard my sister tell my brother to hit me with a wooden plank, and as he was very reluctant, she threatened him with breaking some toy. I love my sister, she is extraordinary in many respects, she has worked on aid projects in the Third World etc, and I think it was very positive that my parents put an immediate stop to her bullying and instilled proper moral values into her. But it left traces - our younger siblings were quite traumatised by the malice she exerted against me. Jack, UK: My older brother used to bully me all the time and at times it was actually quite horrific. But then I believe it's a natural part of sibling rivalry and as bad as it made me feel at the time, I know that I can face the worst of other people. We're now 19 and 23 and I would now consider him one of my best friends. Charlotte, UK: When we were growing up I used to hit my sister (hard) almost daily and whenever I think about it now I feel sick. Many years ago I apologised for my actions and she forgave me unconditionally, but the guilt never really goes away. I do my best to be a good sister and aunty to her son to make up for the past. I was hit by my brother who is eight years older than me on a regular basis, who in turn was hit by my father. I know I am to blame for my actions but I look back and wish an adult had put a stop to it. Don't allow your children to hit each other and punish them severely (without violence) when they do. The scars can last for life. Anonymous, 21 years of age: My brother is a contributing reason why I suffer from severe depression and self harm. There was nothing worse than coming back home after a day of being bullied at school, and on the way home from school, to then be bullied at home. He used to beat me around a lot while my mother was working and we were together. I was, and still am, scared of him, but to everyone else he is one of the nicest people they have ever met, he is popular and very social. Complete opposite to how he treated me. In turn, I have become very introverted. This has happened more recently too. Last year while I was coming out of severe depression he told me to kill myself on several occasions and hit me several times. I called the police about his violent outbursts on a number of occasions (he would also be violent towards my mother), but due to the fact that he was a sibling and not a spouse/partner they could not do anything against him on domestic violence grounds, only assault. He is a sibling in genetics and we occasionally talk, but I do not consider him my brother. June, UK: I was the third of five children. Our oldest brother was a bully and a pervert. The awful thing was that my mother favoured him against the other four. I can still remember one evening when big bro was supposed to be "in charge" of us - which meant he tried to beat us all up. Second-oldest brother decided he'd had enough and set about oldest brother with a poker. I was delighted, I regret to say. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>What do you get if you give musical instruments to a group of elephants? Just a loud noise, or an orchestra? One elephant ensemble in Thailand demonstrates - according to its creators - that animals can really make music. Classical purists might find its percussion section a bit heavy and not all performers pay attention to the conductor. But then this is the orchestra that literally plays for peanuts. "Mei Kot likes to smash the hell out of a gong. Chapati is very, very good at the bass," says Dave Soldier, co-founder of a group that boasts it weighs three times as much as the Berlin Philharmonic. "Phong would pick up a stick and we couldn't get him to stop. "Luk Kop could play three drums at the same time. He could even set up rhythms. But he grew to be fairly dangerous, and he's no longer with the orchestra." The Thai Elephant Orchestra is the creation of Soldier and Richard Lair, an American known as "Professor Elephant" who runs the conservation centre in Lampang, northern Thailand, that is the animals' home. "We thought that maybe elephants would play on instruments if they were ergonomic," says Soldier, an accomplished musician and composer who has performed and recorded with the likes of Bo Diddley and David Byrne. "We thought about designing large instruments that were unbreakable, as even a little hit would break a regular instrument into smithereens." Formed in 2000, the orchestra provided Soldier with an opportunity to explore the cognitive and musical abilities of elephants - he is also a professor of neuroscience at Columbia University. For Lair, instrument-playing elephants provided an attraction that might help raise the funds his conservation centre badly needed. Not long before, the government had tightened controls on the logging industry, leaving many domesticated elephants out of work - and their mahouts (keepers) struggling to pay for their upkeep. "Richard invited me to Thailand and I built giant instruments in the metal workshop," says Soldier. The orchestra now has 22 of them, all designed to be operated with the elephant's trunk or with a stick held in the trunk. Soldier was aware of research by the University of Kansas that showed elephants had the ability to distinguish basic melodies. But he imagined training the animals to actually make music for themselves would be difficult. "I thought that we'd have to give them a banana every time they hit it and an apple every time they made a note," he says. "But it was nothing like that - I would play it, hand them the stick and that was it. They were playing in a few minutes." "Thai people tell me it sounds like the music in the Buddhist temples." The mahouts had always played and sung music to their elephants, believing it made them calmer and happier. Now they sometimes accompany the elephants by singing or playing string instruments. All the custom-designed instruments are made to look and sound Thai, but the elephants can also play a standard harmonica. "Asian elephants can hold a harmonica very easily, as the end of their trunk has finger like abilities," explains Soldier. "One morning I got to the jungle at sunrise and all around me was the sound of a dozen elephants playing the harmonica as they converged on the river for their morning bath. That was really an astonishing experience." The orchestra has so far recorded three albums of music. Some of the tracks are improvised, the mahouts only signalling to the elephants when to start and when to stop. Other tracks feature traditional Thai melodies, in which each elephant plays a note of the scale at a cue from a mahout. So are the Thai elephants genuine musicians? The sounds of certain animals have long been considered musical. Mozart transcribed the melody of his pet starling in a diary. The second movement of Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony includes a passage for three woodwind instruments imitating a nightingale (flute), quail (oboe), and cuckoo (clarinet), and the 20th Century French composer Olivier Messiaen made a habit of incorporating transcribed birdsong into his works. Meanwhile, whale song has been marketed as music to sit back and enjoy ever since marine scientist Roger Payne released an LP, Songs of the Humpback Whale, in 1970. But these are reproductions of natural animal sounds, unlike the music of the Thai elephants which Soldier believes are consciously using instruments to improvise new tunes - and doing so because they enjoy it, just as human musicians do. "The elephants develop and learn to play in different ways," says Soldier, who believes the elephants now enjoy well-tuned instruments. "They learn where the sweet spot on the instrument is, but no-one has taught them how." Soldier conducted a test in which he planted a dissonant note on a ranat, a Thai version of the xylophone, and observed how the elephant then avoided it, preferring those that were in tune. The orchestra mainly uses the five notes of the Thai "lanna" scale. Last December Soldier investigated whether the music of the elephants could even be passed off as "genuine" music. A human orchestra in New York performed an arrangement of one of the elephants' own compositions. The audience was then asked to guess who the composer was. To Soldier's delight, suggestions included John Cage, Alan Hovhaness, Dvorak, Milica Paranosic, and Charles Ives. "When you spend time with elephants you are astonished at the depths of their personalities," he says. "They do things that you just can't imagine other animals doing and they are capable of incredibly complicated behaviour." Soldier has also conducted tests to see whether other species will play instruments. His conclusion is yes, they will. He designed a system of levers for captive zebra finches which, when pecked, would trigger playback of a sample of music. The only reward for the bird was the sound of the music. In another experiment, Pygmy chimpanzees in San Diego Zoo were given hand-bells, and gave every sign of enjoying the opportunity to experiment with sound. Soldier, however, accepts some are sceptical about his theories but he is certain that his experiments do prove something. "I'm saying let's spark our imagination when we think of our relationships with other animals," he says. "This appreciation for art and music seems to go far, far beyond our species." Dave Soldier was speaking to the BBC World Service programme Outlook. Listen to the interview here You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Why the Japanese love Peter Rabbit</title>
      <description>Why the Japanese love ピーターラビット (Peter Rabbit)</description>

      <body>Once upon a time Beatrix Potter wrote a story about a naughty rabbit named Peter. Far away in Japan, he was so popular people flew half way around the world to buy key rings with his picture on. But why? The huddle of Japanese tourists appears from nowhere and waits patiently. They have come from Osaka and Tokyo to a small tourist attraction in the Lake District dedicated to this famous rabbit and his friends. It is Peter - and the shop - they want and I am delaying them by asking them why. But they smile and, via interpreter and tour guide Akiko Wada, politely offer shy descriptions of life-long adoration. Many, like Kazuko Kobayashi, read it in English as a child at school and now share it with their grandchildren. With a wry smile, her husband Iichi Kobayashi says he is here because she brought him. But he is still buying presents and admits the "impressive story" is very popular at home. Perhaps unfortunately for Mrs Tiggy-Winkle, Squirrel Nutkin and the rest of Peter Rabbit's cohort, the Japanese are only really interested in the bunny. Those at the World of Beatrix Potter are ready to buy anything with his image. They move round the displays in no time - considering how far they have come to see them - and descend on the shop. Deputy manager Stacey McShane is used to this speed. "They want to shop as soon as they come in. They go straight into the attraction and they're in and out, they go round the garden, take their pictures of all the characters as quickly as they can and then, once they're in the shop, it's whatever they can buy with Peter Rabbit on. "It's all little magnets or mirrors or pocket books that they can write in. They always buy about 20 of each - once one buys one, they all buy the same." Size is an issue - the smaller and sturdier the trinket the better it fits in a suitcase. Mrs McShane believes if they did not have to transport their purchases back to Japan "they would buy the shop out, they would buy everything". And they already buy a lot, she says. In groups, they are the attraction's best customers "by far". Three days a week, every week, right through the season. They are "very, very" polite and inclined to make "little origami things" for shop staff while they wait to pay. The attraction does not take the interest for granted, however, and managers make trips to Japan every few years to meet tour operators face to face and make sure Peter Rabbit stays on their itineraries. The chief executive of the attraction is on a trade mission in Tokyo to encourage even more Japanese tourists to visit the Lake District. "It might seem odd to be travelling 6,000 miles to a very different culture in order to promote my business," Andy Poole says. "Japan, however, is unlike any other of our overseas markets in that it has a huge affinity with one of Miss Potter's characters in particular, Peter Rabbit. "We welcome some 15,000 visitors from Japan every year, so for us it is very big business." This tour is small by usual standards - only about 10 when 30 or more is not unknown - but it fills the little gift shop. Fujiko Miyazawa is adding to her collection of Peter Rabbit dishes, cups, and "so many pretty things". She is well travelled but has always "longed" to make the trip here, even though supply is plentiful back home. The Japanese passion for all things Peter Rabbit extends to themed shops, restaurants and hotels. There is a replica of Beatrix Potter's house Hill Top, a theme park and a series of Mr McGregor's gardens in one of the country's largest banks. Requests to use the name are sanctioned - or not - through a complicated chain of command that stems down from publishers Frederick Warne via Silvergate Media, who are responsible for global merchandising, and their agent in Japan, Sony Creative Products. Their figures suggest 80% of the population have heard of Peter Rabbit - but why are people interested? What is it about a 120-year-old disobedient animal that has them flocking? Makiko Tanaka, from Sony's content marketing department, says rabbits are very popular in Japan - after bears - because they are "small, fluffy and cute". This particular rabbit taps "a certain admiration or yearning for European culture which is very different from ours". Potter's "British cynicism" or "British way of thinking" is also attractive, she says, especially to the young. "People here think it's mean to refer to Peter's father by a pie, though it came from the original book. I understand it's a sort of euphemism to tell Peter not to go to Mr McGregor's garden, but it's a shock for some Japanese especially who do know Peter Rabbit as a cute character, but do not know the story." Yuriko Allen, a Japanese woman who now lives in Gateshead, says the character is "really famous for baby goods" but also acceptable for adults. She says Peter Rabbit's combination of being "cute" and at the same time not entirely childish is appealing. In a world where many characters aimed at children are bright to the point of garish, she is not the only one to mention the draw of the soft, subtle colours. A Japanese travel operator, Kimoko Ikegami, sums it up like this: "Peter Rabbit is so cute, but he also is very British and people in Japan admire both of those qualities. The books were translated into Japanese 40 years ago and were an instant hit with children of that generation. We have read them ever since." So, Peter Rabbit is cute, British, natural, pastel-coloured, cynical and a guaranteed draw. But his uses are not limited to key rings, toys and a name that will bring in customers. In June 2006 a replica of Potter's house, Hill Top Farm, was recreated, brick-for brick, in Saitama Children's Zoo, an hour from Tokyo. It is "remarkably similar" to the original, says George Wallace, who helps run it. He is associate professor of English and American Literature at nearby Daito Bunka University, which built the replica to house its Beatrix Potter reference library. "On the inside, however, it is a modern museum, built to withstand earthquakes - fingers crossed. We have tried to give the interior an English feel by using materials brought over from the UK, for example the slate floor, the wallpaper, the wooden staircase," he says. "At first I found the popularity of Peter Rabbit rather bizarre. His face appears on all manner of things, often on plates for some reason." But now, 25 years after moving to Japan, the obsession is "just part of the fabric of my everyday life". Meanwhile, in Tokyo, Shino Morishige, who runs Peter Rabbit Flowers, is pleased she went to the trouble of seeking official approval to use the name for her florist shop. It is one up on the other shops and, after all, he is the "most famous rabbit in the world". </body>

      <body>It's not the $1m question. It's the million Swiss francs question. It has become a depressingly universal truth in education that children from poorer backgrounds tend on average to do less well than their richer counterparts. But what would happen if you took those poorer families and gave them money, real hard cash? If you make a poor family richer, will their children's chances of success rise accordingly? Or is it too complicated for such a direct approach? Are children being held back not by lack of money, but by poverty's fellow travellers, such as bad housing, ill health, unemployment, chaotic parenting or family breakdown? Or are poor children getting stuck in a downward spiral of poorly educated parents and bad schools? A US economist, Prof Greg Duncan, has won a million Swiss franc (£680,000) research prize to find out, in an annual award by the Zurich-based Jacobs Foundation, a charity that supports research into improving childhood. Prof Duncan, an expert on the impact of poverty in childhood, wants to take a randomised group of a thousand low-income single mothers with a newborn child and give them $4,000 (£2,890) each for the first three years of the children's lives. Another control group of mothers will get a much smaller amount. Prof Duncan, from the School of Education at the University of California, Irvine, is going to to measure what happens next. The experiment will be a big, expensive, long-term venture, with the prize money supporting the pilot stage. But Prof Duncan wants this to answer some big questions about what happens if you reduce hardship in the earliest years. Can raising income deliver a measurable change in family life and children's progress? Will neuroscientists find a difference in cognitive development between those who receive the $4,000 and those who don't? "We want to see whether we can find a direct link between poverty reduction and brain development in very young children," Prof Duncan says. The idea of giving financial support to low-income families is well established - it underpins a range of family benefits, allowances and tax credits in many countries. But what this study wants to discover is the specific impact of changing income in the years before school. Prof Duncan's earlier research has suggested strong links between experiences in the early years and how adults fare in later life. This is the time when children are developing most rapidly, when the "architecture of the brain" is being established, he says. There won't be any constraints on how these low-income families spend the extra money. If families throw away the cash recklessly, rather than spending it on supporting children, that will be part of the findings. The purity of the experiment is to see what happens in the real world if poor young parents are made slightly less poor. Will their children's school performance be less poor as well? Prof Duncan's research has highlighted how the achievement gap is already entrenched by the age of five, suggesting that intervention needs to come earlier. Before pupils turn up for their first day at school, middle-class children are already ahead of their poorer classmates at such tasks as recognising letters or putting numbers in order. And children who are poor at the age of five are on a downward track that makes them more likely to leave education earlier, earn less money and suffer poor health than richer children. There are also striking differences in family structure. A poor girl is more than five times more likely to grow up and have children outside of marriage than her wealthier classmates. The experiment, which is planned to launch in 2015, will try to establish to what extent living on a low income is the "active ingredient" in such different outcomes. If parents are under less financial pressure, will they behave differently to their children? Will family time change with more spending power? The study will try to separate the low-income effect from other factors such as family relationships, individual character and personal resilience. This experiment has a particular resonance for the US education system. In the past, even though the poor in the US might have lacked some social security "safety nets", Prof Duncan says there was a very valuable compensation from public investment in the education system. It provided a ladder upwards. But that is no longer the case, he says. The US education system had been a world leader, a superpower in education as well as in economic and military terms. But more recently it has faced a stream of bad news. Last month, there was a new low ebb when the influential the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development think tank published research showing that young people in the US workforce had the lowest levels of maths skills in the developed world. Such weaknesses in education have a great significance for the life chances of children born into poverty. A major study this month from the independent Pew Research group, based in Philadelphia, looked at the factors that helped people born into low-income families in the US to rise up the income ladder. Such "rags to riches" stories are more common in Hollywood movies than in real life, the study concludes. But where people do beat the odds and rise up the ladder, the key factor is education. Getting a college degree is the surest route to social mobility, the research shows. College graduates were over five times more likely to escape the bottom rung of the ladder. Family structure was also a big influence. Two-parent families were more than three times as likely to move out of the lowest-income bracket compared with single-parent families. The study shows that education and family are the dominant influences on escaping poverty. What Prof Duncan's research will investigate is whether inserting cash into the equation can improve the odds of success. </body>

      <title>Challenging the image of Ashura in Iran</title>
      <description>How unofficial ceremonies give Ashura a different image in Iran</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24910383</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/71065000/jpg/_71065407_6.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>As Shia communities around the world mark Ashura, the image of the festival in Iran has become one of scenes of black-clad mourners and grief. As BBC Persian's Siavash Ardalan reports, this is part of the state's efforts to reinforce an ideological message and retain clerical control - but unofficial ceremonies create a different picture. Iran places high importance on keeping the tradition of Ashura alive, given its pivotal role in inspiring the state's ideology. As such, Ashura, its ethos and its rituals have been monopolised by the state, leaving a poignant but incomplete impression of Shia Islam both inside Iran and around the world. Some are supported and promoted, others are officially ignored or downplayed, while some Ashura rituals are banned. According to Shia narrative, despite being outnumbered by enemy forces, the Prophet's grandson, Hussein, fought an epic battle in 680 AD on the day of Ashura, knowing that he and his followers would be killed so that future generations could draw lessons from their sacrifice. The Iranian government's narrative of Ashura has been self-serving, centred around the concepts of resistance and martyrdom - President Rouhani may have stretched it too far by declaring last week "the lesson of Ashura is one of negotiations and logical reasoning". Alternative takes on Ashura by dissident Iranian clerics helping to advocate tolerance and pacifism were never allowed to find their way into public awareness and advocates were silenced. Instead the state's propaganda machine had no scruples during the violent 2009 pro-democracy protests - that coincided with Ashura - to draw parallels between protestors and the enemy troops that killed Hussein. Yet the state's take on Ashura in style and form has been more visible than it has in content. Iran's clerical establishment likes to stress its independence from government policies, yet it adheres to the government's own particular guidelines on how to observe Ashura. According to the state, an appropriate Ashura ceremony is one in which black-clad, chest-beating and head-slapping participants congregate in emotionally charged ceremonies involving a mullah or Madah (a professional Ashura story-teller) reciting tear-jerking and often dubious tales of what happened on the fateful day when Hussein and his followers were killed. This not only keeps the custom under clerical control but can also be tailored to incorporate politically convenient messages. These are officially funded with substantial budget allocations going to "religious institutions". In 2102, over $5bn were earmarked for the promotion and propagation of state-approved religious activities. Additionally, in the lead up to Ashura, state radio and TV continuously show scenes of crying, anguish and despair mixed with melancholy songs and poems. Artistic innovations - and even the invention of new ceremonies - are allowed within this framework, with substantial state support. For example, one ceremony called "Congregation of Hussein's Infants" - mothers taking their babies to mourning gatherings that commemorate the infants killed in Ashura's battle - was introduced 10 years ago by a state-funded religious institution. The ritual has now become a regular feature of Ashura's celebrations among Iran's urban middle class, drawing millions of families. Its promoters even tried to register it as a cultural heritage of Iran in Unesco. Traditional but less grim theatrical performances that re-enact the events which took place on the day of Ashura, Tazieh, receive almost no funding, leaving local communities to organise these events themselves. Tazieh is a Unesco-registered cultural heritage. Ruling clerics are ambivalent about Tazieh and divided over other rituals practiced in small towns and rural country. Some clerics consider them permissible while others view them as heretic or demeaning. For many of the rural faithful, Ashura is more of a sombre occasion than a tragic one - stylistically influenced by a community's geography and history. While in some coastal communities like Bushher, Ashura is marked by washing theatrical instruments crafted for the occasion in sea water, the faithful in mountainous areas like Shahre-Kord carry lit candles in a procession over the hills and prairies at midnight. In Bijar and Khoram-abad, locals cover themselves in mud with rosewater from head-to-toe, and in towns like Ardebil, worshippers carry special basins filled with water in remembrance of Hussein's thirsty warriors. Instead of basins, other rural communities carry palm wood, shovels or handicrafts. In some other towns like Khomeini-Shahr, Ashura is marked as a sombre but colourful costume festival. The state's disregard for such ceremonies has skewed not just the view of outsiders and non-Shia of Ashura ceremonies but also that of ordinary Iranians, many of whom have poor knowledge of, or little exposure to, the diversity of the country's customs practiced during Ashura. Historically, the clerical establishment had no qualms with Ashura rituals that involved self-flagellation. Devout Shia across the world continue to follow these violent practices that require blood to be spilt from scratches or cracks on the skin as a sign of readiness to shed blood for Huseein. However, once the practice came under scrutiny and was used by secular people to highlight an underlying fanaticism of state ideology, ruling clerics began to disavow it. Iran's Supreme Leader issued a fatwa against Ghamezani - worshippers cutting their heads open with razor sharp instruments. Reported clashes between Iranian police and security forces in communities where self-flagellation takes place during Ashura eventually ended Ghamezani. The justification for the crackdown was that such practices defame Shia Islam and also projects a negative image of Shia to outsiders and non-believers. The same rationale has been applied to other customs which clerics themselves practiced and promoted before but distanced themselves from once they gained power. For example, the tradition of telling stories telling and tear-jerking tales about Ashura's events always provided ample pretext for ridicule and derision by non-believers as many of these stories were made up by the speakers who earned credits for how well they could make their audiences cry and wail to accounts of Hussein's death. Once again Iran's Supreme Leader stepped in declaring that all such stories need to have been substantiated by scholars. Establishment clerics also fell out with their colleagues over the descriptive language used in many of these recitations. Traditionally, self-deprecation has been the order of the day in such story-tellings, with many mullahs likening their followers to dogs loyal to Hussein. They also use inappropriate language to describe the physical beauty of Hussein and his followers. Many devout Shia still hang imaginary photos and paintings of an aesthetically pleasing Hussein on the walls of their homes and shops. The state has yet to win this battle. </body>

      <title>NHS shake-up proposes two-tier A&amp;E</title>

      <body>A two-tier AandE system in England should be created as part of an overhaul of services, NHS chiefs say. The review by NHS England suggested the biggest 40 to 70 units - specialising in heart attacks, strokes and trauma - be called major emergency centres. It would leave the remaining 70 to 100 AandEs - known as emergency centres - to deal with less serious conditions. It also suggested changes to the way ambulance crews and the new 111 phone service work to "decongest" AandEs. Greater co-ordination between community services, such as GPs and pharmacists, would also help, it said. The measures have been put forward in response to the growing pressures on accident and emergency departments. Patient numbers have risen by 50% in the past decade and last winter the problems got so severe that the NHS missed its four-hour waiting time target. Extra money has been set aside to help the NHS through this winter and the next one. But this review aims to set out the long-term vision for the service. Many of the proposals are already in operation somewhere and in essence the review is calling for this to be formalised across the system. For example, there are already a number of AandE units that act as major centres in everything but name. But by setting a target of having between 40 and 70 major emergency centres it means this will have to be extended across the health service. NHS medical director Prof Sir Bruce Keogh, who led the review, said: "AandE is creaking at the seams. It is not broken, but it is struggling. "We need to change the way we work. But what we are suggesting here already exists in places, we are just trying to formalise it so it is available for everyone." The review said there also needed to be further changes to the system if pressure was going to be relieved. About 40% of people who attend AandE do not need treating there. What is more, the problems developed by a fifth of patients who are eventually admitted to hospital with emergency conditions could have been avoided with better and earlier treatment in the community. The review said key to tackling these problems was ensuring patients got access to the services that were best suited to them first time. To achieve this, 111, which has been beset by problems since it was launched in April to replace NHS Direct, will need to be much more responsive, giving patients direct phone access to doctors, nurses and other health professionals. Ambulance crews will need to treat more patients at the scene to reduce the number of patients transferred to hospital. Meanwhile, there needs to be greater co-ordination between GPs, pharmacists and the network of minor injury clinics and walk-in centres to give patients 24/7 access to care outside of hospital. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said Labour welcomed Sir Bruce's report but deplored "the government's attempt to avoid presenting it to Parliament and abdicate all responsibility for the crisis in AandE". "Ministers said this report would have lessons for the immediate winter, as well as the longer term," he added. "But they are failing to act and their response remains 'crisis, what crisis'? They are forcing AandEs to go into winter with too few nurses, doctors and beds." He said the prime minister had "made it harder to get a GP appointment, closed NHS walk-in centres and scrapped NHS Direct, leaving people with no alternative but to go to AandE". Patients Association chief executive Katherine Murphy said the review had presented a "promising vision". "At present there is genuine confusion amongst some patients, who then opt for AandE as a safe default option," she added. College of Emergency Medicine president Dr Clifford Mann welcomed the proposals, although he said NHS chiefs would need to be careful the reorganisation of AandEs did not lead to "detrimental" increased journey times. He also said: "Any plan to provide emergency care must be based upon an adequate number of appropriately skilled clinicians and on this matter the review is disappointingly silent." The changes will now go out to consultation and the review team will spend the next six months looking at the cost and staffing implications before producing another report in the spring. It is likely to take three to five years before the overhaul is completed. </body>

      <title>UK aid flight lands in Philippines</title>
      <description>The first plane carrying humanitarian aid from the UK to the Philippines lands at Cebu airport.</description>

      <body>A plane carrying humanitarian aid from the UK has arrived in the Philippines. It landed at midnight local time (16:00 GMT), carrying almost 9,000 shelter kits for families made homeless by Friday's devastating typhoon. The UK is also sending an emergency team of 12 medical staff at the request of the Philippine Department of Health. The stricken country's president has said the estimated death toll of 10,000 was too high, but the UN estimates 11 million have been affected in some way. President Benigno Aquino says the number of people killed is more likely to be up to 2,500. More than half a million people have been displaced. The UK kits that arrived at Cebu airport contain plastic sheeting, rope and rope tensioners. They were flown to the Philippines from UK stores in Dubai. Officials from the Department for International Development (DfID) said each kit would keep a family of five sheltered. It will be down to charity World Vision - one of 14 aid organisations that make up the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) - to distribute the kits. The other charities are Action Aid, Age International, British Red Cross, Cafod, Care International, Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Islamic Relief, Merlin, Oxfam, Plan UK, Save the Children and Tearfund. While several countries have deployed ships and aircraft to help, many people are still without food, water and shelter. Aid agencies have warned the security situation is deteriorating and there are reports of looting, as those preparing to enter the disaster zone face logistical hold-ups. "There's a lot of work going on behind the scenes to make sure that when we're bringing aircraft in, they're the right aircraft, that the runway can accommodate them, that there's things like fuel so we can get them back out there," said Claire, from the British Red Cross. "If we try and rush in too quickly, without any of this pre-planning, then we're going to have massive bottlenecks where aircraft are stuck on the ground and that's not going to help anyone." John Cordell, from the charity ShelterBox, which is delivering emergency shelters and supplies, added: "It sounds as though the security conditions are getting a little bit worse. There've been reports of attacks on food convoys and looting of aid. "I think that is deterring a lot of aid agencies from getting in there." DEC chairman Salah Saeed likened the destruction in the city of Tacloban, which was particularly badly hit, to that seen after the devastating tsunami of 2004. "There is currently no food, water or electricity. We can only imagine how much worse the situation will be for families living in towns and remote villages," he said. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said the 12-strong UK medical team consisted of "volunteer surgeons, doctors and paramedics who are expert at operating in emergency situations such as this". The team will be led by professor of international emergency medicine Anthony Redmond, of Manchester University. Later Ms Greening is due to host a meeting to discuss the international response to the ongoing disaster. She will be joined in person or via video link by representatives from UN agencies, donors and other organisations. The meeting is expected to focus particularly on how to help women and girls affected by what the Philippine president declared a national calamity earlier this week. Meanwhile, British ship HMS Daring, a Type-45 destroyer deployed near Singapore, is due to arrive at the disaster area on Saturday. The ship's captain, Angus Essenhigh, told the BBC its mission would be to provide "life-saving assistance" such as water, shelter and food. A DEC appeal was broadcast on Tuesday evening, and the committee said £1.5m had been donated so far. The UK government, which has already pledged £10m in aid, said it would match donations to the appeal pound for pound up to £5m. It said its overall contribution would help to get food, aid and shelter to a total of 800,000 people. The UN has launched an appeal for $301m (£190m) to help relief efforts in typhoon-hit areas. </body>

      <body>A painting by Francis Bacon of his friend and fellow artist Lucian Freud has become the most expensive artwork ever sold at auction after it fetched $142m (£89m, 106m euros) in New York. The triptych, Three Studies of Lucian Freud (1969), is considered one of Bacon's greatest masterpieces. It was sold after six minutes of fierce bidding, Christie's auction house said. The price eclipsed the $119.9m (£74m) paid for Edvard Munch's The Scream last year. At the same auction, Jeff Koons broke the world record for a price paid for a single artwork by a living artist. His sculpture Balloon Dog (Orange) - one of a series of five stainless steel sculptures in varying colours - fetched $58,4m (£36.7m). The previous record for a living artist was set by a Gerhard Richter painting depicting an Italian city square, which sold in May for $37.1 million (£23.3m). It was the first time Three Studies of Lucian Freud had been offered at auction and bidding opened at $80m (£50m, 60m euros). Its presale estimate was $85m (£53m, 64m euros). A telephone bidder won with an offer of $127 million (£80m), which, after commission, means they will pay a total of $142m. The auction house did not disclose the identity of the buyer. Bacon, known for his triptychs, painted Three Studies of Lucian Freud in 1969 at London's Royal College of Art, after his studio was destroyed in a fire. Francis Outred, head of Post-War and Contemporary Art at Christie's Europe, said the work was "a true masterpiece and one of the greatest paintings to come up for auction in a current generation". "It marks Bacon and Freud's relationship, paying tribute to the creative and emotional kinship between the two artists," he added. The pair met in 1945 and became close companions, painting each other on a number of occasions, before their relationship cooled during the 1970s. Exhibited in Bacon's renowned retrospective at the Grand Palais, Paris in 1971-1972, the three panels that form the painting were separated in the mid-1970s. One panel was shown at the Tate in 1985 before the three sections were reassembled. The complete work was displayed in New Haven, Connecticut in 1999. It got its first ever UK public viewing at Christie's in London in October this year. </body>

      <title>SSE in price vow over green levies</title>
      <description>SSE becomes the latest of the big energy companies to say it will adjust its prices if the government cuts green levies.</description>

      <body>SSE has become the latest of the big energy companies to say it will adjust its prices if the government cuts green levies. SSE's Alan Young told BBC Radio 5 live that if the levies were cut, "we will adjust our bills accordingly - no ifs, no buts". Both Npower and EDF made similar comments on Tuesday. E.On has already promised to cut its bills "pound for pound, penny for penny" if levies are reduced. SSE is due to increase its average energy tariffs by 8.2% from 15 November. SSE's comments came as the firm reported pre-tax profits of £336.4m for the six months to 30 September. Stripping out one-off items, SSE's underlying profits fell to £354m from £400.8m in the same period a year ago. The company said that its retail business recorded an £89.4m operating loss, and within this its energy supply division made a loss of £115.4m, compared with a profit of £48.3m a year earlier. SSE said this reflected "the impact of higher wholesale gas, distribution, environmental and social costs". However, the company is increasing its dividend by 3.2% to 26 pence a share. Mr Young told the BBC: "Profit that we make has a purpose. In the last five years we have invested £2.5bn more in the energy networks and in the power generation in this country than we've made in profit after tax." In the past few weeks, five of the "big six" energy companies have announced price rises, blaming the government's social and environmental policies for some of the increases. However, the green levies account for just 8% of the average energy bill, so there is limited capacity to reduce the increases already announced. Nevertheless Npower said on Tuesday that if the cuts went through as anticipated, it would reduce its planned price increase from 10.4% to 6%. Smaller energy companies are already protected from many of the green levies. Those with fewer than 250,000 customers do not pay the Energy Companies Obligation (ECO) or the Warm Home Discount. As a result smaller companies may have less scope to cut bills, should levies be changed. The government will make an announcement in the Autumn Statement on 5 December. It has also announced a review of the way that competition is working in the market. Labour has said that it will freeze gas and electricity bills for 20 months if it wins the 2015 election. </body>

      <body>Consumers face 17 more years of above-inflation increases in energy and water bills as they help pay for the renewal of the UK's infrastructure, Whitehall's spending watchdog has warned. The National Audit Office added that "gaps" in the official analysis meant government lacked "an overall picture of affordability". It expressed particular concern about low-income households. But the government said it was "committed" to keeping bills down. Fuel costs have become a highly charged political issue in recent months. Five of the UK's six main energy companies have announced price rises, at an average of 8.1%. On Tuesday, EDF Energy became the latest provider to increase bills, by an average of 3.9%. Alan Young, from energy company SSE, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "Standards in this industry do need to improve." But he denied his company was trying to make a "quick buck" from its customers. "We're interested in making a sustainable profit that allows us to invest in the long term," he said. "This country has had reliable supplies of energy. When people have gone to switch the lights on, they have come on. "Have there been shortcomings in standards? Absolutely. Is there a commitment on our part to improve them? Totally. "But fundamentally people have got reliable supplies of energy for their money. We're concerned that they should continue to do so, but in a way that is affordable." In September, Labour leader Ed Miliband announced plans for a 20-month energy price freeze from May 2015, should his party win the next election. And the government has launched a competition review and will review green and social charges, responsible for some of the cost of bills. In an escalation of rhetoric, Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey told an industry conference on Tuesday that firms should not use customers as "cash cows". The Treasury estimates that at least two-thirds of the £310bn of planned infrastructure investment over the next decade and beyond will come from private companies, ultimately paid for by consumers. In its report, the National Audit Office (NAO) said it was estimated there would be an 18% average real-terms increase in household energy bills between now and 2030. For water, the figure would be 28%. The NAO also said: "Affordability can only be assessed taking into account all household bills, household incomes and wider costs of living. "Gaps in analysis, and the lack of a common approach to measuring affordability, mean that the government does not have an overall picture of affordability, either for the average household or for those on low incomes." The NAO expressed particular concern about the plight of the low-income households where energy and water bills accounted for 15% of spending in 2011 - almost double the overall average of 8% - while their incomes had fallen by 11% in real terms since 2002. A Conservative source said: "We agree with the NAO that government should 'rigorously scrutinise all decisions on both value for money and affordability grounds', that is why the prime minister has announced that we need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills at the Autumn Statement." And a government spokesman said: "Decades of underinvestment have left the UK struggling with insufficient energy infrastructure, but we are committed to fixing the failures of previous governments, and to making the difficult decisions that will allow us to have the infrastructure we need. "The government is committed to supporting hard-working families and that's why we're cutting tax for 25 million people and taking 2.7 million people out of income tax altogether by 2014, helping the most vulnerable with their bills, freezing fuel duty and sticking to the economic plan that has got all sectors of the economy growing." </body>

      <body>A global investigation into alleged currency-market manipulation has been expanded to 15 of the world's biggest banks, the Financial Times says. The probe now includes euro-dollar trading, the biggest part of the market, according to the London-based newspaper. Last month Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it was examining whether traders had colluded. Regulators in Switzerland, Hong Kong and the US are also involved. The global foreign exchange market is worth more than $5tn a day, and London is the most important hub, accounting for about 40% of all foreign-exchange trading. Several banks have confirmed that they are co-operating with the investigation, including Royal Bank of Scotland, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Barclays. Earlier this month Barclays suspended six traders as part of a probe into suggestions that currency markets could have been rigged. Suspicions of exchange rate manipulation centre on a one-minute window of trading at 16:00 every day that is used to set exchange rates. The suggestion is that traders colluded to push through high volumes of trades in the run-up to and during the window to influence rates. Last month Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) suspended two traders in connection with the investigation into the currency markets. </body>

      <body>Sainsbury's has reported a half-year pre-tax profit of £433m, up 9.1% from the same period in 2012. The supermarket giant said the results were "strong" considering the "tough trading environment". Like-for-like sales, which strip out the impact of new stores, were up 1.4% excluding fuel. Sainsbury's has now overtaken Asda and moved into the number two spot for the largest supermarket in the UK, second to Tesco. Total sales for the 28 weeks to 28 September rose 4.4% to £13.9bn. Online sales were up 15% while sales at its convenience stores rose more than 20%. Chief executive Justin King said the firm's share of the grocery market was at its highest for a decade, after 35 consecutive quarters of like-for-like sales growth. But Mr King told the BBC that the retailer still had a long way to go to catch Tesco in terms of sales. He said customers still had less money to spend after the recession. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: "Without question, this is a strong performance from a resurgent Sainsbury's." However, he added that "intense competition, rising commodity prices and the group's sole UK focus limited its scope for further expansion". In October, Tesco reported a 23.5% drop in profits for the first half of its financial year to £1.39bn, which it said was down to a challenging retail environment, particularly in Europe. </body>

      <body>Shop stewards at Portsmouth dockyard will find out later whether there is a future for shipbuilding in the city. They are due to meet with BAE Systems management on Wednesday to hear the outcome of two days of talks. Last week the defence giant announced plans to cut 1,775 jobs at its sites in Scotland and southern England, where building would cease altogether. However union officials say they have not yet given up hope of retaining some shipbuilding at the south coast yard. Discussions at BAE Systems' Farnborough headquarters between the union and bosses broke up earlier with neither side giving much away. The results of the talks will be put to workers at mass meetings in Hampshire and on Clydeside on Thursday morning. BAE - which employs 1,200 people in Portsmouth and 3,200 across its Govan, Scotstoun, Rosyth and Filton sites - has said it will end shipbuilding on the south coast in the second half of next year. It plans to transfer the remaining work, on the Royal Navy's two Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers, to Govan and Scotstoun. The move threatens 940 staff jobs at the Portsmouth yard and a further 835 in Glasgow, Rosyth and Filton in Bristol. BAE says the cuts are necessary because of a "significant" fall off in demand. Meanwhile, Minister for Cities Greg Clark has said parts of a regeneration deal signed between the government and Portsmouth were included because of the BAE job cuts. The so-called "city deal" is aimed at boosting employment and development in the area. </body>

      <title>'Flu watch' coming to UK schools</title>
      <description>Scientists are to begin collecting data on flu outbreaks from UK schools this winter to better understand its spread.</description>

      <body>Scientists are to begin collecting data on flu outbreaks from UK schools this winter to better understand its spread. The Flusurvey surveillance project is in its fifth year, but for the first time classrooms are being asked to take part. It coincides with the NHS beginning to roll out childhood flu vaccinations. In time, the nasal spray vaccine will be available for children aged 16 and under. This flu season it is being offered to all children aged two and three, as well as children of any age with long-term health conditions such as diabetes. In Scotland and seven pilot areas in England, children aged four to 11 will also be eligible for it this year. In order to help control and lower the impact of flu, the Flusurvey researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine want to understand what role children play in catching and spreading the disease. In 2012-13, the highest rates of infection were reported in the under-18 age group. Head of the project Dr Alma Adler said: "Last year we found that taking public transport does not increase your risk of catching flu and we discovered that 'man flu' didn't really exist - in fact women were slightly more likely to report feeling worse when they have flu than men. "This year we're keen to find out more about children because they are the 'key spreaders' of flu." The Flusurvey team will be working with the British Science Association to link up with schools for the 2013-14 flu season to monitor the impact of the virus. They will also be looking to see what role exercise and diet might play in keeping flu at bay. Public Health England compiles its own weekly update on flu incidence rates. Currently, there is no sign that the flu season has begun - GP consultant rates for flu-like illnesses have so far remained low throughout the UK. Figures suggest a fifth of eligible two and three-year-olds have received their flu vaccine. A third of eligible "at risk" adults and children, such as those with asthma, have been immunised, as have half of people in the over-65 age group. A new vaccine is needed each year to protect against the flu viruses expected to be in circulation that winter and to boost the immune response. Although influenza activity in the UK rose to only low levels in the 2012-13 season, activity was prolonged and reached levels higher than those seen in 2011-12. If you have flu, you generally start to feel ill within a few days of being infected. Flu causes a sudden high temperature, headache, general aches and pains, tiredness and a sore throat. The symptoms are far more severe than with a common cold. </body>

      <title>Shortfall in free nursery place scheme</title>
      <description>Data shows just seven out of 10 of the most disadvantaged two-year-olds earmarked for free childcare have been offered a place.</description>

      <body>Just seven out of 10 of the most disadvantaged two-year-olds earmarked for free childcare on a flagship scheme have been offered a place, data shows. Ministers pledged 15 hours a week of free childcare to 130,000 two-year-olds in England from September. But the latest Department for Education figures show that just 92,000 children are receiving such childcare. Childcare providers said the offer, which was heralded by the deputy prime minister, was not properly funded. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-School Learning Alliance, said at a time when many providers were still underfunded for the existing free nursery place scheme for all three- and four-year-olds, it was vital that the government makes sure the two-year-old scheme is adequately funded. "This will determine the success of the initiative and the positive impact for generations to come." Some nursery providers say the average rate of funding, £5.12 per hour, is so low the work they would have to carry out with these disadvantaged children would effectively be "pro bono". This is because of the very high level of need that the children have because they are younger and sometimes highly troubled. The scheme has struggled to find enough free childcare places for disadvantaged two-year-olds, often because nursery provision tends to be in more affluent areas where the disadvantaged children being targeted do not live. Also places have to be in settings rated good or outstanding by Ofsted. In May, the BBC News Website reported that the scheme was 55,000 places short, and there were warnings that it would not open fully in all areas, with shortages predicted in London and other urban areas. Both Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Education and Childcare Minister Liz Truss have stressed the need to give disadvantaged children, who tend to do worse at school, the best start in life. Mr Clegg praised the number of places made available on the scheme, saying: "Early access to high-quality childcare is vitally important to ensure children are ready for school, ready for the world and able to get a good start in life. "Giving disadvantaged children early support gives them the best possible chance to succeed, it means they're less likely to fall behind their wealthier classmates and it can make a huge impact on their future. It is vital for a fair and prosperous society." However, the Department for Education has now said the funding for the places will in future be on a "use it or lose it basis". "The number of participating children will determine the amount of funding they get," it said. "Where parents are not taking up these place, local authorities will get less money." The department is due to expand the scheme to 260,000 children in England next September. Childcare workers association Pacey, which represents many childminders, said it was concerned that the government had already noted that in some areas it might not have enough providers rated good or outstanding to cover all the children entitled to the two-year-old offer, and would have to use providers graded as requiring improvement. Its chief executive, Liz Bayram, said: "This is of even more concern given the emerging evidence that individual childminders are struggling to access funding through this scheme, as local authorities seem to show a preference for nursery settings to deliver this care, even if those settings might not be good or outstanding. "Many families benefit from the flexible home-based service that childminders offer, so ensuring parents can make a real choice about the type of childcare that is right for them could only help increase uptake even further." Labour's shadow minister for childcare and children, Lucy Powell, said the "cost of living crisis" was being made worse by families who were promised free childcare finding that they do not have a place. "This government has hit families with reduced support, rising childcare costs and fewer places. Labour's primary childcare guarantee and the extension of free childcare for working parents from 15 to 25 hours for three and four year olds will be a real boost for families feeling the pinch and struggling to balance work and family life." </body>

      <title>Row over UKIP's poppy wreath logo</title>

      <body>UKIP has denied a wreath it laid to mark Armistice Day was a political statement after receiving criticism from other political parties. The wreath - with a UKIP logo in the centre - was laid at the war memorial on Burrow Hill, Plymstock and one of four laid by the party in Plymouth. The city council's Conservative and Labour leaders said using a political logo on Remembrance Day was wrong. But UKIP insisted the wreaths were symbols of honour and respect. David Salmon, UKIP party chairman for Plymouth and South West Devon, said it was hypocritical of the Conservatives and Labour to accuse UKIP of "dirty tricks". "I'm boiling and furious that they're trying to score points over something as important as Remembrance Day," he told BBC News. "These are the same wreaths we laid last year and nothing was said then - but there were no elections last year - so I think their 'outrage' is more a ploy to besmirch UKIP." A personalised card on the wreath said: "We come not to mourn our dead, but to praise them". Tudor Evans, leader of the Labour-controlled city council, said the logo on the wreath should be removed. "It is very bad taste - we have always made Remembrance Day an apolitical event," he said. "Propaganda in this way is not at all the right thing in a military city which has seen a lot of war deaths." The council's Conservative group leader, councillor Ian Bowyer, said he was appalled by the size of the UKIP logo which he described as "overtly political". "A discreet card on the wreath saying who it's from is one thing, but to have the UKIP logo festooned on it is disrespectful." Mr Salmon said the wreaths were ordered through the Royal British Legion. "The logo may be a bit over the top, so next year I'll consider a smaller one," he said. "But I want to retain the logo because I'm proud of what we stand for." The Royal British Legion's poppy factory in Richmond said wreaths were produced every year with logos for "all the mainstream political parties". A statement from the national UKIP party said: "This was far from a malicious act and the local branch just thought it was the nicest way to collectively remember those who have served our country." </body>

      <title>Poor pupils 'miss top universities'</title>

      <body>Richer teenagers are three times more likely to go to top universities than working class pupils, even if they have the same grades, research suggests. Researchers compared the proportion of teenagers in England with good grades with figures for those with places at "high status" institutions. The gap between the groups is not simply due to grades, they conclude. "We need to talk about other possible causes," said Dr John Jerrim of London University's Institute of Education. The researchers also looked at the extent of the access gap between the social classes to elite universities in Australia and the United States. "Although academic achievement is an important factor, a substantial proportion of the elite university access gap in each country remains unexplained. "This suggests that there are working-class children whom, even though they have the grades to attend, choose to enter a non-selective institution instead," said Dr Jerrim, who led the research. The study suggests that children of professionals in England are 3.2 times more likely to go to a Russell Group university than working-class children. But the study found that the gap was not just down to poorer grades among working-class pupils. Once the researchers had taken pupils' exam achievements into account, they found that teenagers with good grades from professional families were 1.4 times more likely to go to one of these universities than working-class pupils with similar grades. The research suggests the access gap is in fact less pronounced in England than in the United States and Australia. In Australia, children of professionals are 2.7 times more likely to attend a highly selective university than their working-class peers but only half of this difference is explicable by high school grades, say the researchers. In the United States entry to elite private universities is dominated by students from professional backgrounds who are more than six times more likely to attend than those from working-class families. The researchers say less than half (48%) of the difference is explained by high grades. The figures for leading US public universities show wealthier students are 3.3 times more likely to attend, with around 40% of the difference explicable by grades, says the study. The paper will be presented to a summit on university access organised by the education charity Sutton Trust. Dr Jerrim will also tell the summit about differences in student funding in the three countries. Bursaries for low and middle-income students at Harvard, for example, can allow them to graduate "debt free", despite fees of more than £37,000 a year, he will say. Dr Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group, said the report showed the main reason pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds were less likely to go to leading universities "is because they are not achieving the right grades" in the right subjects. "It is also the case that some very bright students are not encouraged to apply for leading universities. We cannot offer places to those who do not apply or who have not done the right subjects to study their chosen course. "Access is an issue for leading universities across the globe - there is no silver bullet to this entrenched problem." Dr Piatt said the group was working hard to tackle the access gap, "pumping millions more into outreach programmes" and publishing advice to help students choose their A-levels. Pam Tatlow, chief executive of the million+ group said: "The Sutton Trust wrongly assumes that the interests of well-qualified students are best served if they study at a small number of universities which label themselves as elite. "Students are much more savvy than this. They understand that high-quality, top-class degrees leading to high-flying, professional careers are available at a wide range of universities. It is therefore unsurprising that they choose to study at these universities." </body>

      <body>Six projects across England have been awarded £6m in government funding to teach English to the public using non-conventional methods. They competed for funding with the aim of reaching 24,000 non-English speakers in so-called priority areas across London, the Midlands and the North. The projects will be given funding initially but then encouraged to become self-sustaining. Councils have been told they must encourage people to speak English. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles told local authorities in March they should encourage speaking English by not translating documents into foreign languages. He said: "Speaking English is crucial to allow us to come together and be part of British society. People are unable to do this and are condemned to a limited life if they can't speak our language." Jan Bros, director at one of the six projects, the London based e3 Partnership, said learning English was far more preferable to relying on translators. She said: '"It is better to empower individuals to undertake things for themselves than encourage them to be passive. "Our learners would rather be able to have conversations themselves than rely on family members to do everything for them." The winners, picked from 124 entrants, were tasked with coming up with innovative approaches for English tuition in local communities. The projects are meant to put language learning into daily activities. Figures from the 2011 census show that across England 1.7% of the population cannot speak English. This rises up to 9% in some parts of London. Another funding winner is a project called Timebank, targeted at women from Bangladeshi, Somali and Pakistani communities, which aims to reach 1,300 participants in Leicester and Birmingham. Director Helen Walker said they were trying to find those most in need. She added: ''Although no-one is excluded from our programme, women are the largest non-English speaking group here. "We will teach functional everyday English using volunteers who understand the difficulties of being a non-English speaker in the UK. "Over 12 weeks we teach a different module every week on practical English like going to the doctors and using computers. Most importantly the lessons take place in a community centre - somewhere safe, secure and familiar, which has childcare facilities like a creche.'' Another winning entry, from a group called FaithAction, called 'Creative English' involves holding classes in mosques and churches. In Manchester, the winning project #TalkEnglish intends to train shop-staff to be 'sympathetic listeners' - so that while out buying groceries participants are encouraged to speak English. But critics argue that the projects are not a sufficient replacement for English lessons for migrants which have been subject to central government funding cuts. Guy Taylor, from the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said previous methods of teaching were sufficient and the new approach through community projects was outsourcing services previously provided by the government. He said: "While we support these kinds of projects, the government is cutting free provision of ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) for migrants. These kinds of classes were useful, often giving participants lifelong language skills. "Outdated approaches can be improved but replacing traditional language-teaching with unestablished projects could be a superficial solution." The government said the overall aim of the competition was to increase integration and ultimately save public money by developing self-sustaining projects. According to the competition criteria, planning for long-term sustainability was a key part of being selected. Ms Walker said that had always been Timebank's plan. She said: "The whole point of this is to have a sustainability element beyond the initial phase. We hope the volunteers will train other volunteers and we are developing core learning materials which will be accessible online for the foreseeable future." Those behind the e3 Partnership say they also aim to increase the employment prospects of those taking part. Ms Bros said as part of their programme they will encourage learners to take part in local markets, including setting up their own stalls. If successful there are plans to roll out the winning projects on a larger scale. </body>

      <body>Plans to kill a non-native species of fish by poisoning a north London brook have led to residents voicing concerns that the move is an "experiment". The Environment Agency will use Rotenone in Cuffley Brook, Enfield, to eradicate the Asian Topmouth Gudgeon. But the poison will also kill every other fish along the stretch. The Environment Agency said mammals and birds would not be affected and has pledged to restock the brook with native fish species "if required". One resident, Jill Simpson, said she had been told it was the first time "they've used it in running water so we're an experiment". "We're worried about the eels that the Environment Agency were very pleased to get back in the brook so is this the right thing to do?" she said. The work is scheduled to start on 18 November and will eradicate the Topmouth Gudgeon, considered one of the most damaging non-native fish in Western Europe, with the potential to dominate food supplies and habitats. But the native species in the brook that will also die include roach, eel, minnow, stickleback and stone loach. The Environment Agency said: "The piscicide contains rotenone, which is selective to fish so mammals and birds that eat it will not be affected. "Once the Topmouth Gudgeon have been removed we will ensure that the area is restocked with native fish, if required." The RSPB said the course of action was "not ideal" but "unavoidable". Spokesman Tim Webb said: "Rather than it have an impact and lose all our native species it's best to remove this threat. "We're not sure what the [future] impact will be at the moment and we'll be doing all we can to restore that habitat." </body>

      <title>Vast iceberg poses risk to shipping</title>
      <description>UK researchers are awarded a £50,000 emergency grant to track and predict the movement of a vast iceberg that could enter Southern Ocean shipping lanes.</description>

      <body>UK researchers have been awarded an emergency grant to track a vast iceberg in Antarctica that could enter shipping lanes. Latest images show several kilometres of water between the iceberg, estimated to be about 700 sq km (270 sq miles), and the glacier that spawned the block. The £50,000 award will fund a six-month project that will also predict its movement through the Southern Ocean. The icy giant broke away from the Pine Island Glacier (PIG) in July. "From the time it had been found that the crack had gone all the way across in July, it had stayed iced-in because it was still winter (in Antarctica)," explained principal investigator Grant Bigg from the University of Sheffield. "But in the last couple of days, it has begun to break away and now a kilometre or two of clear water has developed between it and the glacier." "It often takes a while for bergs from this area to get out of Pine Island Bay but once they do that they can either go eastwards along the coast or they can… circle out into the main part of the Southern Ocean. Prof Bigg told BBC News that one iceberg was tracked going through The Drake Passage - the body of water between South America's Cape Horn and Antarctica's South Shetland Islands. If the iceberg did follow this trajectory, it would bring the Singapore-size ice island into busy international shipping lanes. Eyes in the sky The team of scientists from Sheffield and the University of Southampton will use data from a number of satellites, including the German TerraSAR-X, which first alerted researchers at the Alfred Wegener Institute to the July calving. PIG is described as the longest and fastest flowing glacier in the Antarctic, with vast icebergs being calved from ice shelf every 6-10 years. Previous notable events occurred in 2007 and 2001. Scientists first noticed a spectacular crack spreading across the surface of the PIG in October 2011. As well as tracking the movement of the iceberg, Prof Bigg explained that the team also planned to predict its path through the Southern Ocean. "Part of the project is to try and simulate what we think the berg might do, given the... wind fields being experiencing in the region recently. He added that the team would attempt to predict possible tracks into the coming 12 months or so. If the berg did move towards or into shipping lanes then a warning would be issued via the services numerous ice hazard agencies around the world. </body>

      <body>A woman has written a thank you letter to the burglars who broke into her house and apologised for not having "particularly expensive tastes". Kate Barrett, 36, wrote that she and her partner, Dan Owens, were "disappointed" the thieves had ignored her VHS video and cassette collection. Miss Barrett stuck the letter to the back door of the Northampton home she shares with Mr Owens. The burglars smashed through the door on Sunday evening. The couple were both away at the weekend and Miss Barrett, who works as a communications officer, got home first to discover the "ransacked" house. Mr Owens, 34, said: "I'd gone to my parents for the weekend while Kate went to London to watch the Strictly Come Dancing live show. "She called and I came straight over and the place had been ransacked." The burglars had gone through every room but "there wasn't too much to take - some cash, a camera, an ipod, but nothing too major". He added: "I think they were planning to go out through front door with the telly, but luckily the spare key doesn't work. "She's a big hoarder and has all these old tapes and videos from way back when and they are welcome to those." The thieves broke in by climbing the garden wall and smashing through the patio door. Northamptonshire Police said officers are investigating the burglary and appealed for witnesses to come forward. </body>

      <title>Warning of NI reform delay penalty</title>

      <body>The work and pensions minister has renewed pressure on the Northern Ireland Executive to pass its Welfare Reform Bill. Mike Penning also warned that Stormont faces millions of pounds in penalties over the delay. He is due to meet NI's social development minister in Belfast later. The reforms are being introduced at Westminster and include a new universal credit payment to replace child tax credit and housing benefit. But the legislation is still going through the assembly at Stormont. It was pulled by Social Development Minister Nelson McCausland in April, before it could reach the Northern Ireland assembly's consideration stage. The Treasury has said the financial implications of delays to Northern Ireland implementing reforms equate to about £5m of lost savings every month. It has said that unless the reforms are introduced in Northern Ireland, the block grant will have to be reduced in order to compensate for lost savings. Speaking ahead of the meeting, Mr Penning said he was hoping to find a way forward "to avoid substantial reductions in funding and to ensure there's a system in place that is right for claimants and fair to taxpayers both in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK".‪ "While this is ultimately a devolved matter, I'm concerned about the lack of progress that has been made which has already cost over £30m in lost savings and this figure is increasing by around £5m every month," he said. "If this continues we are potentially talking about tens of millions of pounds more that will need to be found elsewhere by the Northern Ireland Executive.‪‪" There have been claims that the financial impact is greater in Northern Ireland than other parts of the UK because of the large number of people who claim Incapacity Benefit (IB) and Disability Living Allowance (DLA). Mr McCausland said: "I am committed to taking the Welfare Reform Bill through the assembly as soon as the parties in the executive can agree to move forward to consideration stage. "I have developed a package of measures which I believe shapes welfare reform to meet the needs of the people of Northern Ireland. "I would hope to be able to bring this package, to the executive in the very near future." Sinn Féin MLA Alex Maskey sits on the social development committee. "We're being threatened basically by the British government to penalise us further for trying to make sure that we represent the interests of the people here, that we represent, that no Tory represents," he said. The Welfare Reform Bill marks the biggest overhaul of the benefits system since the 1940s. Mr McCausland has also said the Northern Ireland Executive received £6.5bn from the Treasury through tax credit and social security, with the contribution from the National Insurance Fund in Northern Ireland amounting to £2.5bn. He warned that should the executive fail to agree welfare reform and therefore break with GB parity there was a "potential £4bn" shortfall for Northern Ireland's budget. </body>

      <title>Lyric contract 'likely rigged' - PAC</title>
      <description>The Public Accounts Committee (PAC), says it has a "strong impression" that the awarding of the £11m contract for the rebuilding of the Lyric Theatre was "rigged and manipulated".</description>

      <body>Stormont's spending watchdog has said it has a "strong impression" that the awarding of the £11m contract for the rebuilding of Belfast's Lyric Theatre was "rigged and manipulated". However, the most senior civil servant in the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure has said he did not believe there was evidence to support the claim. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) report centres on the way in which the contract was awarded to the building firm Gilbert Ash. The report is a follow-up to an investigation by the NI Audit Office, however, it draws stronger conclusions. It focuses on the way in which the consultants running the bidding process adjusted the costs in the tenders made by five construction firms. The adjustment meant that Gilbert Ash, which had initially submitted the most expensive bid, came into line with the other firms. Gilbert Ash was then awarded the contract on the basis of a "quality ranking". Six months later, the firm made a £150,000 donation to the Lyric rebuilding fund. The PAC is strongly critical of the failure to retain the detailed documentation which shows how the bids were evaluated and adjusted. Public sector best practice states that those documents should have been retained for seven years, however, the consultants running the process destroyed them shortly after the contract was awarded. The PAC says that the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) and the Arts Council should have taken ownership of the documents or ensured that they were kept by the consultants. It considers that some of the adjustments made to the bids are "unexplained". It also states that conflict of interest arrangements were "not adequate" and that the Lyric fundraisers were "pursuing patronage" from Gilbert Ash at the same time as contract negotiations were continuing. It concludes that "taking all of the points in the round" it is "left with a very strong impression that the outcome of the tender process was both rigged and manipulated". The chair of the PAC, Michaela Boyle, explained how its members had come to conclude there had been "serious flaws" within the tendering process. "When the committee strongly said that we believed there had been manipulation around this process, that was in the absence of a strong documentation case coming before us," she said. "There was insufficient evidence to conclude that the best practice approach and value for money was applied, there was no scrutiny of the tender evaluation process by the department or its agents which is central procurement. "We recommended a number of different recommendations, but we're not a disciplinary committee so we can't recommend disciplinary action." An earlier report by the NI Audit Office (NIAO) had concluded that it was "unable to obtain assurance" that the evaluation of the bids applied best practice. It added that that there was no assurance that the adjustments made were "accurate and equitable". An internal audit conducted by DCAL, which is attached to the PAC report, concluded that it was "highly unlikely" that the sponsorship donation from Gilbert Ash influenced the awarding of the contract. Meanwhile, Gilbert Ash said it had "no control over the adjustment to tender costs made during the procurement process" - a practice it described "as standard in our industry to allow for like-for-like comparison of bids". Its statement added that the firm was "delighted to sponsor the Lyric Theatre, a fantastic arts venue and a major contributor to cultural life in Northern Ireland. "'We implemented a similar sponsorship partnership when working on the Waterfront Hall project and may follow similar practice in the future, should the opportunity arise." A Lyric Theatre spokesperson said The Lyric "completely rejects the wholly unevidenced claims made against the project". A senior source associated with the delivery of the Lyric project told the BBC that they believe the PAC conclusions were "deeply unfair" and that it was "untenable" to believe that all the parties involved had been colluding over the bid. DCAL Minister Carál Ní Chuilín said: "I welcome the recommendations in the report. We will consider the PAC report and provide a formal response in due course. "Significant changes have been made to the way in which the department manages its capital projects and many of the recommendations in the NIAO Report have already been implemented." </body>

      <title>National parks visitors spend £1bn</title>
      <description>Wales' three national parks attract more than 12 million visitors who spend £1bn a year, according to a report into their economic value.</description>

      <body>Wales' three national parks attract more than 12 million visitors, who spend £1bn a year, a report claims. A review into Snowdonia, Pembrokeshire Coast and Brecon Beacons was commissioned by National Parks Wales, the WLGA and Natural Resources Wales. It said it meant £557m was added to the Welsh economy as a direct result of the parks. But criticism about the management of planning issues has been raised by small businesses within the parks. The Federation of Small Businesses said it had recently carried out a survey of its members which found that many thought the three national park authorities in Wales did not understand business and economic issues in particular with planning matters. It said it hoped Wednesday's report called Valuing Wales' National Parks would lead to recognition within the park authorities to recognise the importance of supporting businesses. The report found: The report based its findings on research conducted by a variety of organisations including the Welsh government, Office for National Statistics, visitor spending estimates and other sources. Culture Minister John Griffiths said the parks were an "asset" to Wales and its economy. Speaking on behalf of National Parks Wales, Snowdonia chief executive Aneurin Phillips said the parks were "very much the lungs of our nation". He added: "Unlike the national parks in the United States - which are largely uninhabited areas - Wales' national parks are very much living communities with over 80,000 people residing within their boundaries, providing employment for approximately 30,000 people. "This report has given us a real insight into the tangible economic benefits of our national parks and I'm naturally pleased with its findings." However, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Wales questioned whether the study was a response to its own recent report in which respondents claimed the national park authorities did not understand businesses and economic issues. Iestyn Davies, head of external affairs for FSB Wales, said: "We can only take today's report as much-needed recognition of the importance of economic development within Wales' national parks. "FSB Wales hopes that recognition will now be reflected in the dealings of the national parks and their officers with small businesses, particularly when it comes to planning." Simon Hart, Tory MP for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, said he was pleased with with the "positive picture". However, he added: "People come to the national parks because of the landscape and the people who live there - they don't come because of the national park authorities. "They clearly have a role in protecting and maintaining the park, but so does everybody who runs a business or a farm there. "I think we should be cautious about believing this is all down to a layer of public sector government." He has previously described the national parks planning system as an obstacle to economic regeneration, and claims parks should be able to consider social and economic factors as well as environmental matters. </body>

      <description>Fire service chiefs across Wales urge the public to be vigilant during a four-hour strike over pensions.</description>

      <body>Fire service chiefs across Wales have urged the public to be vigilant as crews stage a four-hour strike. Members of the Fire Brigades Union will walk out between 10:00 and 14:00 GMT on Wednesday in their fourth strike in recent weeks. UK ministers plan to raise the retirement age for firefighters from 55 to 60 and say the industrial action is "completely unnecessary". The FBU says 60 is too old to be fighting fires. It also says its members face redundancy if they fail fitness tests. Officers across Wales have warned there will be a reduced service operating during strike hours. Rod Hamilton, assistant chief fire officer at South Wales Fire and Rescue Service, said none of the normal appliances would be available. Instead, six military and up to 10 auxiliary support appliances will be used. South Wales will also be supported by its neighbours in the Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service. Mr Hamilton said: "What that means is, of the normal 64 appliances, we'll be cut down to 10 to 15 appliances, so there will be a reduced capability during that period. "What I'd ask is for the public to be vigilant, to stay safe, but if they do have any genuine emergencies, they should report them." Once incidents are reported, he said the service would "use our limited resources to prioritise for the ones that are highest life risk". Simon Smith, chief fire officer for North Wales Fire and Rescue Service, advised people to ensure they have working smoke alarms, and to avoid drinking and cooking, amongst other advice. He added: "I would warn residents that it is likely that during the strike period we won't be able to respond as we normally would - prevention is best". Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it had "robust contingency plans in place and will continue to operate business as usual as far as reasonably practicable", but urged people to take extra care. Assistant chief fire officer Chris Davies said: "Our contingency planning is going well and we are fortunate to have a number of operational staff who are not affiliated with the Fire Brigades Union and will be working as usual during this period of action." However, he said emergency responses would be "slightly reduced" and urged people to familiarise themselves with the service's safety tips. </body>

      <title>Calls for tougher deer controls</title>
      <description>MSPs on Holyrood's Rural Affairs Committee are to hear calls for tougher controls on the number of deer in Scotland.</description>

      <body>MSPs are to hear calls for tougher controls on the number of deer in Scotland. Evidence on the subject is being heard by Holyrood's Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee. The damage caused by Scotland's large deer population has been described by environmentalists as the country's "most pressing conservation issue". Many of the deer are on privately-owned sporting estates which operate a voluntary system of deer management. Scottish Environment Link, which represents the country's biggest environmental organisations, claims the population of red deer alone has increased from 150,000 in the 1960s to about 400,000 today. Those figures are disputed by land managers. The Association of Deer Management Groups said the population had declined in many areas and was now less than 300,000. The environmental groups, which include the John Muir Trust, the Scottish Wildlife Trust and RSPB Scotland, argue large areas of the country's uplands and native woodlands have been "ecologically impoverished" due to the large number of deer on Scotland's sporting estates. They are calling for major changes to the present voluntary system and want to see a new statutory system which would require private landowners to meet deer cull targets set by Scottish Natural Heritage. In its submission to the committee, the Association of Deer Management Groups said new regulations would fail to resolve disputes over deer numbers, while increasing bureaucracy and costs. The association also highlighted the economic benefit of deer stalking to Scotland's rural economy. Stalking is estimated to be worth £105m and to support the equivalent of more than 2,500 full time jobs. Land managers also believe undergrazing may become a problem if deer numbers are heavily reduced, leading to the loss of species-rich grassland and an increased risk of wildfires. </body>

      <title>Munro Top demoted on new measurement</title>
      <description>A rocky peak on Skye's Pinnacle Ridge is shorter than previously thought, according to a new measurement.</description>

      <body>A rocky peak on Skye's Pinnacle Ridge is shorter than previously thought, according to a new measurement. Knight's Peak had been listed as a Munro Top with a height of 915m (3,002ft). Munros and Munro Tops are mountains of more than 3,000ft (914.4m). They are prized by hillwalkers and climbers. Knight's Peak, however, has lost its status after surveyors using GPS technology found it to be 16.5cm (6in) too short to qualify as a top. A Munro Top is a subsidiary of a nearby Munro. Climbers do not regard them as having the "sufficient gap" from a neighbouring mountain to be considered as a Munro proper. The classifications take their name from Victorian climber Sir Hugh Munro, who began writing a list of Scotland's highest mountains in the late 1800s. Knight's Peak, a subsidiary of Sgurr nan Gillean, was named after W Knight, who made the first recorded ascent of it 140 years ago. John Barnard, one of the surveyors involved in calculating the new height, said GPS allowed measurements to be made down to a few centimetres. He told BBC Scotland: "It doesn't take anything away from the hill. The hill is still there and it is a fantastic hill. It is just the categorisation that has changed." Alistair Milner, who coordinates height records for The Munro Society, said new technology made it "inevitable" that some peaks would lose their status. He added: "We want to make the list as accurate as we can. "Sir Hugh Munro was a stickler for accuracy. We are just carrying on his tradition." Mr Milner said that because of the challenging route up to Knight's Peak climbers would still want to tackle it. The same survey team also found that another Munro Top on Skye, Basteir Tooth, was 1.2m (4ft) higher than previously recorded. Last year, Beinn a'Chlaidheimh, a Munro near Ullapool, was demoted to Corbett status following a fresh measurement of its height. Corbetts are Scottish hills of 762m to 914.4m (2,000-3,000 ft). Also last year, two peaks that had twin Corbett status because mountaineers could not determine which was taller were separated by new measurements. Buidhe Bheinn above Kinloch Hourn and Sgurr a' Bhac Chaolais, overlooking Glen Shiel and linked by a ridge, were previously thought to be 885m (2,903.6ft). But modern survey equipment recorded Buidhe Bheinn the higher at 885.50m. It now solely holds the status as a Corbett. </body>

      <body>A man who broke his spine when he deliberately ran into a brick wall while in detention awaiting deportation is suing for damages. Gambian Amadou Nyang, 39, is now paralysed from the neck down and lives in a care home in West Sussex. The incident at Tinsley House removal centre near Gatwick was allegedly triggered after he was told he could not watch his football team on TV. The claim is contested by G4S Care, Justice Services Ltd and medical staff. Simon Readhead QC told the High Court in London that Mr Nyang's had been confined constantly at Tinsley House and not being allowed to see his national team was the last straw. It was clear that Mr Nyang responded to those who took the time to counsel him and he could be calmed down if handled properly, he said. While imprisoned in 2007 for possession of a false passport, Mr Nyang tried to hang himself with an electric cord and was then assessed by a psychiatrist, His history was not followed up as it should have been when he was transferred to Tinsley House that December, the hearing was told. The 10-day hearing, which is concerned with liability, is contested by G4S Care, Justice Services Ltd and three medical staff who provided cared for detainees. They dispute that Mr Nyang was suffering from a mental health disorder but say he was frustrated and angry. He sustained his injury by his own deliberate act of running into the wall when he was of sound mind, they will claim. The hearing continues. </body>

      <body>The government body which sanctioned the use of a controversial aerial pesticide over a Berkshire woodland had "quite serious concerns" about the method, it has been revealed. A Freedom of Information request showed Natural England's worries about the method being used to kill off the larvae of a caterpillar. However it still permitted spraying to take place at two copses in Pangbourne using a helicopter. A Forestry Commission spokesman said it was the "least damaging" way to tackle a larvae that "could be a serious problem to human and tree health". The spraying took place at the Herridge and Broom Copses, both within a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), in an attempt to eradicate the oak processionary moth (OPM) larvae. The caterpillar which feeds at the top of oak trees contains a toxin in its hairs that can cause itchy rashes, eye and throat irritations. Natural England licensed the Forestry Commision (FC) to carry out the aerial spraying of the pesticide Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) - the first of its kind in the UK. But a Freedom of Information (FoI) request submitted by concerned Pangbourne resident Antoinette Earl showed Natural England believed the spray would have "a very significant impact" on other moths and butterflies in the area. The body's briefing report also stated the method would not succeed in "eliminating OPM from this woodland". Miss Earl has called the spraying an "act of environmental vandalism". She added: "I decided to look into it further, and I was shocked to discover that Natural England was opposed to the spraying, but approved it, against the advice of its own expert scientists, knowing that the impact could be devastating to rare species and the wider food chain at this very sensitive site." Natural England said in a statement that it did indeed have "concerns" that other species of moth and butterfly "may be impacted" but that "the effects on these populations would be short-lived and they would rapidly re-colonise". It added that it granted consent on condition that a five-year monitoring programme of birds, moths, butterflies and bats would be carried out on the site, compared with other unsprayed woodlands in the area. Miss Earl said she was concerned the pilot exercise would lead to aerial spraying elsewhere. "OPM is a big issue in several London boroughs," she said, "and I worry that the Forestry Commission will use Pangbourne as the starting point for a much bigger spray operation there, with the potential for a massive impact on wildlife across a much wider area." A Forestry Commission spokesman said of the OPM larvae that it "shared concerns about the potential impacts of the options for controlling it", but that it had "worked closely with scientists and regulators". </body>

      <description>England's bowlers struggle as an Australia Invitational XI close on 271-5 on the first day of the final Ashes warm-up match.</description>

      <body>England's bowlers were frustrated on the first day of their final Ashes warm-up match against an Australian Invitational XI in Sydney. Stuart Broad took three wickets and Steven Finn two as England reduced the hosts to 93-5. But an unbroken sixth-wicket stand of 178 between Ryan Carters (94no) and Peter Nevill (76no) helped them close on 271-5. The first Test against Australia in Brisbane starts on 21 November. England will hope their bowlers pose more of a threat at the Gabba than they did in the second half of the day at the SCG. With James Anderson rested and Chris Tremlett left out, Finn and Boyd Rankin were given the opportunity to stake their claim for the third seamer's spot in England's Test side. However, other than the superb Broad, the tourists' attack struggled after captain Alastair Cook won the toss. Broad, bowling a probing line and getting the ball to nip off the seam, dismissed Aaron Finch and Callum Ferguson cheaply before returning to remove Ben Rohrer with the help of a fine catch at backward point by Michael Carberry. Finn accounted for Kurtis Patterson and opener Ed Cowan, who was dropped by Australia during this summer's 3-0 Ashes defeat in England, for 51 shortly after lunch. However, Finn proved expensive at times and Rankin, despite being slightly more economical, could not find the right line and length to truly threaten the batsmen. Carters and Nevill batted cautiously before growing in confidence, and 23-year-old Carters, who had a first-class average of just 20.75 before the game, went on to the highest score of his career. With rain forecast for the final two days of the four-day match, England will hope to take the final five wickets quickly on the second day to give their batsmen some time at the crease. Kevin Pietersen will be hoping to find form after having an injection in a knee, while Jonny Bairstow, who was tidy behind the stumps on the opening day, will also be keen to impress in the absence of injured wicketkeeper Matt Prior. </body>

      <body>England loose-head prop Alex Corbisiero has been ruled out of Saturday's match against New Zealand after a reoccurrence of a knee injury. Corbisiero joins prop Mako Vunipola on the sidelines with wings Christian Wade and Marland Yarde also out. Harlequins prop Joe Marler will have to prove he has recovered from concussion in order to be considered. Marler was taken off at half-time in England's win over Argentina and will have to pass cognitive tests to play. Wasps prop Matt Mullan, 26, who won his only cap as a replacement against Italy in 2010, remains with the squad and will almost certainly be on the bench. Apart from the inclusion of Mullan for Corbisiero and scrum-half Ben Youngs for Danny Care, this is the same squad which featured in the 31-12 victory over Argentina. Youngs, a late withdrawal from the bench against Argentina with a hip complaint, has been given the all-clear for this week. Head coach Stuart Lancaster will name his starting XV on Thursday. Northampton and Lions loose-head Corbisiero, 25, who replaced Marler for the second half against Argentina last weekend, was thought to have recovered from the knee injury that saw him miss the win against Australia in the opening autumn Test. But England head coach Stuart Lancaster said: "Alex took part in Tuesday morning's forwards training session but suffered some discomfort to his knee. "He did not train on Tuesday afternoon and will not be available for selection for the weekend. "It's disappointing for Alex having missed last year's Six Nations because of an injury to his other knee. "With Mako also unavailable, it's a great opportunity for Joe Marler and Matt Mullan, who has been with us all week and is raring to go in the 23." London Irish wing Yarde failed to recover from his hip problem, while Wasps winger Wade will miss the game against the world champions with a tight hamstring. Ahead of Saturday's game, Lancaster added: "We've had a good start to the week and now it's a case of tapering down the training and getting ourselves ready for the ultimate challenge. "The Twickenham crowd has been great over the last two weeks and we know they will be just as vocal as they were against New Zealand last year." England 23-man squad v New Zealand: Forwards: D Cole (Leicester Tigers), D Hartley (Northampton Saints), J Launchbury (London Wasps), C Lawes (Northampton Saints), J Marler (Harlequins), B Morgan (Gloucester Rugby), M Mullan (London Wasps), G Parling (Leicester Tigers), C Robshaw (Harlequins), B Vunipola(Saracens), D Wilson (Bath Rugby), T Wood (Northampton Saints), T Youngs (Leicester Tigers). Backs: C Ashton (Saracens), M Brown (Harlequins), L Dickson (Northampton Saints), O Farrell (Saracens), T Flood (Leicester Tigers), B Foden (Northampton Saints), A Goode (Saracens), J Tomkins (Saracens), B Twelvetrees (Gloucester Rugby), B Youngs (Leicester Tigers). </body>

      <title>Bairstow's keeping worries Vaughan</title>
      <description>Michael Vaughan says he would "worry immensely" if Jonny Bairstow keeps wicket for England in the first Ashes Test.</description>

      <body>Former England captain Michael Vaughan says he would "worry immensely" if Jonny Bairstow keeps wicket in the first Ashes Test against Australia. Bairstow, 24, will take the gloves in Brisbane on 21 November if Matt Prior fails to recover from a calf injury. "Jonny Bairstow will be fine batting at number seven but I would worry immensely if he has to keep in a Test match," Vaughan told BBC Radio 5 live. "I wouldn't put him in the top five keepers in England." Prior, 31, has played 57 consecutive Test matches for England, having missed the fourth match against West Indies in February 2009 following the birth of his child. Bairstow, Yorkshire's first-choice wicketkeeper, has played 12 Test matches but is yet to keep in the longest form of the game. Vaughan, who led England to victory in the 2005 Ashes, added: "I questioned it as soon as the squad was selected. "I just don't think he's done enough of it to withstand the pressure of an Ashes series keeping wicket." Bairstow has mainly been used as a specialist batsman by England, keeping in just one Twenty20 international. Opportunities to develop his keeping with Yorkshire have been hampered by his international commitments, though he has been training with England wicketkeeping coach Bruce French. "Bairstow is a package that could work in 20-over and 50-over cricket, but in five-day cricket, yes you need someone who can bat, but also to take those important catches," added Vaughan, who played 82 Test matches. "He hasn't done enough for Yorkshire this summer because he has been playing for England. "He may have to keep in the hottest of pressure zones, the Gabba, in front of 40,000 spectators. The selectors feel Bairstow is the next best, but I would question that." Vice-captain Prior led England in the absence of Alastair Cook for their first match of the Australia tour against Western Australia. However, he suffered the calf injury against Australia A and will miss the final four-day warm-up match against an Invitational XI, which starts on Wednesday. With 220 Test match victims, Prior is third on England's all-time list of wicketkeepers,  behind Alan Knott (269) and Alec Stewart (241). In all Test cricket, of players to have scored 2,000 runs and claimed dismissals, only current England team director Andy Flower (51.54), Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara (56.98) and Australia's Adam Gilchrist (47.60) can better Prior's batting average of 42.36.  "The injury to Matthew Prior is a massive, massive concern," added Vaughan. "He's been brilliant for England for three or four years and is the engine of the team. "Prior is a confidence player, he really likes to in the middle, scoring runs. He could go into that first Test without any cricket." Vaughan believes Chris Tremlett will join James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann to form England's bowling attack in Brisbane, but the former skipper also has concerns about the Surrey pace bowler. Tremlett was a key member of the squad that won 3-1 down under in 2010-11, taking 17 wickets, but he has played only five Tests since then. "I think it will be Tremlett, but it would be one the biggest acts of faith I have seen on behalf of the selectors for a long time," said Vaughan. "He was a pivotal member of the Ashes winning team but he hasn't bowled anything near that standard since." </body>

      <title>How hard is it to swim the length of Britain?</title>
      <description>Sean Conway this week finished his swim from Land's End to John O'Groats - via Ireland. But what makes it such a tough challenge?</description>

      <body>Sean Conway this week finished his four-and-a-half month long swim from Land's End to John O'Groats - via Ireland. But what makes it such a tough challenge? He was the first: People have swum from Cuba to the US, across the Bering Strait, and between New Zealand's north and south island. But no-one had swum from Land's End to John O'Groats before. "So I had no-one to ask for advice," says Conway. The physical toll: He was not a serious swimmer before the trip. His technique unravelled as tiredness set in. "The first hour of the day would be great, my technique would be good. After an hour and a half I'd start dropping the shoulders and the elbows, then it's a downhill spiral, feeling weak and cold." He was swimming about 2,500 strokes an hour. Over the course of the whole trip he swam about three million strokes. The neck and shoulders get chafing. He lost a lot of weight. He was nearly 11 stone (70 kg) when he set off and ended up under 10 (63.5 kg) . "I didn't have enough body fat. I was burning more calories than I could eat," he says. Icy water: The cold was always there. "I could barely talk when I got out," he says. Not only was it uncomfortable, it sapped the strength. And there was no shower on the boat where he could warm up. The water averaged 14 or 15C for most of the swim. There were two extra cold "patches" - the swim across from Northern Ireland and the waters around Skye were both 12 Celsius, he says. After the first two weeks, he found his body adjusting to the cold. But unfortunately this was offset by his weight loss. His wetsuit became baggier, meaning it let more water in and allowed his body heat to escape. His jaw was so cold in the water that feeds had to be via pureed food. "Sean had to control his core body temperature within fine limits to swim, digest food and survive," says Mark Kleanthous, who coached Conway before the swim. "Water is 25 times more conductive than air, resulting in a great loss of body temperature. When muscle temperature drops by just one degree performance dips by as much as 3% making it harder to swim." The time: Swimming 10 miles a day is not an "enormous" amount, says Andrew Lane, professor of sports psychology at the University of Wolverhampton. But to do this for four-and-a-half months is a huge challenge. When Conway set off on 30 June, he expected the swim to take two months. A nice summer adventure. In the end it took more than twice that. It would have been easy to think after two months that he'd done his bit, says Lane. He could have found plausible excuses and felt satisfied with his efforts. But that's not how endurance athletes can think. "You have to be born a little different maybe," says Martin Strel, the Slovenian long distance swimmer who in 2001 swam for 84 hours non-stop along the Danube - a world record. "Don't change your mind. You have to say this before the start. You don't change the schedule halfway," Strel says. By the end Conway was worried the weather would prevent them completing it before Christmas. The support crew had already given up far more time than planned. In desperate moments he thought about letting the crew go home and pressing on without the boat. It wasn't realistic, he admits. Luckily the weather cleared enough for them to be able to finish. Wildlife: He swam through shoals of jelly fish. After being stung on the face, he grew a beard to protect himself. Long distance swimmers have to overcome fears of "what lurks in the deep", says Lane. Salt water: By the end he was extremely sensitive to swallowing sea water. "My gag reflex from salt water would make me throw up. In the last three weeks just swallowing half a teaspoon full would make me vomit." The tide: The sea's pull went north to south and vice versa in roughly six-hour periods, meaning he had to try and cover as much distance as possible when the tide was with him. And then sit it out when it was against him. "So I had six hours to do my best." Logistics: He slept on a 55-year-old wooden support boat. "The biggest dreams I had were about the boat sinking." It took four-six hours to traverse between the start and end of each day's swim and a suitable mooring. Finding places to anchor was far more difficult than anticipated, he says. The loneliness: Head down in the water for hours on end, with only darkness below, alone with one's thoughts is not easy. Fewer people have successfully swum the English Channel than climbed Everest, says Kleanthous. The relatively high failure rate is partly due to the mental discipline required. Conway says he is a stubborn character. He broke the day up into 90 minute segments rather than think about how far was left. A crucial factor was the "ability to switch off", he says. "You stop thinking about negative stuff and have fun." Music helped. There was one dubstep song by Australian band Knife Party that helped. "I shouldn't say which one as the lyrics are not very nice." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>What happened in the rest of the world in 1066?</title>
      <description>British people tend to see the world through the key dates - 1066, 1707, 1918, 1945 etc. But what was happening in other parts of the world?</description>

      <body>British people tend to see the world through key dates - 1066, 1815, 1914, 1945 etc. But what was happening in other parts of the world in those fateful years, asks Dr Michael Scott. Last year I was watching the build-up to the London Olympics opening ceremony when a commentator quipped: "This will be a date you will never forget." It got me thinking. There are, of course, dates in each of our lives we will always remember. But there are also dates like that in history, dates that have been drummed into our heads through countless school history lessons, textbooks and commemorations: 1066, 1815, 1914. Crucial dates on which things happened in a particular place, which defined eras and in some cases, still define Britons today. But that commentator's line also got me thinking. What else was going on around the world at the same time as the Olympics? And the same question could be asked of crucial dates in history - famous because of an event happening normally in just one part of the world. In 1066, William, Duke of Normandy, may have been invading England, but what was happening in the rest of Europe, Central Asia, China, Africa, the New World? The problem with learning history by key dates and moments is that it gives us a spotlit view of the past - bright stars of major events twinkling against a giant - but dark and mysterious - night sky of history. As a result we lose sense of the context of major events, and the ways in which our history - and our world - has been, and still is, connected. So we set out to find out what was happening elsewhere on 14 October 1066 as the Battle of Hastings was raging. The Norman knights were also expanding into Sicily and mainland Italy, while the migration of Seljuk Turks from Central Asia was about to threaten the Byzantine Empire, eventually leading to the call for the First Crusade. But my favourite moment in 1066 is from China, where Sima Guang began writing his monumental history of China, known as the "comprehensive mirror to aid in government". Frances Wood, a former head of the Chinese section at the British Library dug out an early manuscript of this work. Wood explains how this history was supposed to be of use to those in charge - by setting in context the decisions made by China's leaders in centuries past (403-207BC) and by analysing the moral virtues of their actions. How about 5 November 1605 when Guy Fawkes and his cabal were plotting to blow up Parliament and the king? Russia was enduring its "time of troubles" - as immortalised in the opera Boris Godunov - and subsequent conflict with the powerful alliance of Poland-Lithuania. Shah Abbas I was building an empire in Persia, while early trading expeditions were attempting colonial settlement in Maine, financed by English Catholics. But perhaps most intriguing was Strasbourg, where the first printed newspaper was being published by Johann Carolus, providing regular international news updates for the paper's wealthy readers. Carolus had earned his living by producing handwritten newsletters, gathering the news from a network of contacts across Europe. But in 1604 he bought a complete printing shop from the widow of a famous printer and in the summer of 1605, he switched to printing his newspapers, hoping to earn more money by printing a higher circulation for a lower price. Next year Britain will be marking the centenary of 4 August 1914, when the great European powers went to war following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. But while Europe was focused on war, in Venezuela, Shell struck oil for the first time, igniting not only an era of corrupt parcelling out of land to friends of the man in charge, Juan Vincente Gomez, but also a time in which the position of Venezuela more radically changed from something of a "banana republic" to a serious and powerful player on the world stage - by 1929 Venezuela exported more oil than any other country in the world. The atmosphere in New York in August 1914 was very different from gloomy London - a vibrant music scene that gave birth to the foxtrot. The foxtrot came out of the dances of New York's black community, explains Strictly Come Dancing head judge Len Goodman. The most famous dancing couple of the era, Vernon and Irene Castle, were key in putting the foxtrot on the map. Another date remains shrouded in mystery - that of the birth of Jesus Christ. It appears our ancestors have got the calendar wrong. The historical Jesus was probably born in 4/3BC rather than what was later judged as the turning point of 1BC/1AD. But as this special child was being born in Bethlehem, not far away in the Roman province of Syria the techniques of glass-blowing were going from strength to strength, as glass became not just a possession of the super-rich, but an affordable luxury for the growing middle classes. Elsewhere, on the borders of modern-day China and Korea, and we see the emergence of the Goguryeo kingdom, a topic which has recently become politically sensitive as Korea and China both compete to claim it as part of their own cultural heritage. Some claim the very word Korea originates from the term Goguryeo. The story of this kingdom sits on the very boundaries of myth and history, as different Korean and Chinese sources speak of the deeds of the kings of Goguryeo, including one fierce leader, King Yuri, whose six sons were to have difficult and disastrous lives. In what would later become Latin America, the Maya culture was flourishing. What is so often forgotten about the Maya is that they were operating in a jungle environment without beasts of burden and livestock. That only makes their incredible feats of architecture even more impressive, given the difficulty of clearing space in the jungle and of the need to carry almost all the materials themselves to the sites. By looking elsewhere we can get a better sense of global history and of the sheer variety inherent in human civilisation, as well as the way in which our world has, and continues to be, connected.

      <body>Nick Clegg will launch an attack on Labour's economic policy, urging voters not to be "fooled again" in the run-up to the next general election. The deputy prime minister will say the coalition's priority remains "clearing up the mess" left by Gordon Brown's government in 2010. While defending austerity policies, he will say his Lib Dems did not enter Downing Street "just to make cuts". But Labour argues coalition policies have delayed the recovery. UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show. Speaking at a supermarket in west London, Mr Clegg will say this has not dimmed the determination of the Lib Dems and Conservatives to cut the deficit. He will say: "Three and a half years in and the coalition's priority is still the same - fixing the economy and cleaning up the mess Labour left behind. "That task has never been simply about balancing the books. We inherited an economy that had become profoundly unbalanced. Growth was driven almost entirely by one industry, financial services. Almost exclusively from one city - London. And behind the boom was a nation becoming less productive and less competitive. For years governments had simply papered over the cracks. "So my party didn't come into government just to make cuts. For us, this has always been about setting in motion a much more fundamental overhaul of our economy so that Britain never finds itself here again." The deputy prime minister will warn there are "no quick fixes" and the coalition is "seeing through the difficult decisions on the deficit". He will add: "Ironically, the people who still underestimate what's required are Labour - the party that got us here. "This is a party that wants to get back into government in 18 months, yet the sum total of their plan seems to be a single promise to temporarily freeze energy bills. "As always, if it sounds too good to be true, it is. The energy companies would simply hike up prices before and after the freeze and Labour could do nothing to stop them." Mr Clegg will say: "So don't be fooled again: you cannot afford Labour. Let loose in government on their own they would wreck the recovery - costing jobs, driving up interest rates and undermining the growth needed to cut tax bills and fund public services. "They cannot be allowed to undo all of the sacrifices that have been made and everything that has been achieved - the British people would pay the price." For Labour, shadow chancellor Ed Balls has called the improvement in the economy "long overdue". The coalition government had "started to claw back some lost ground", but more needed to be done to improve living standards, he said. On Monday, Prime Minister David Cameron used his speech at the Lord Mayor's banquet to express his desire for a "smaller, leaner state... not just now, but permanently". </body>

      <title>Labour loses housing benefit vote</title>
      <description>The government has seen off a Labour challenge to its housing benefit changes in the House of Commons, with two Lib Dems rebelling.</description>

      <body>The government has seen off a Labour challenge to its housing benefit changes in the House of Commons. MPs voted by a majority of 26 to reject what critics have dubbed the "bedroom tax", removing some payments if council tenants' properties are deemed to be under-occupied. But two Liberal Democrat MPs - Andrew George and party president Tim Farron - backed Labour's motion. The government says it hopes to save £500m as a result of the changes. It argues that its policy, which it calls the abolition of a "spare-room subsidy", was introduced to reduce the housing benefit bill and free up homes for families living in overcrowded conditions. In the Commons, Labour's work and pensions secretary, Rachel Reeves, urged Liberal Democrats to back her party and vote for the abolition of the coalition changes. She said it was a "shame" Lib Dem Pensions Minister Steve Webb had not listened "to his own party who only in September at the Liberal Democrat party conference voted overwhelmingly against the bedroom tax, saying that it is 'discriminating against the most vulnerable in society'". Ms Reeves added: "But I am afraid that's what you get with the Liberal Democrats. They say one thing at their conference and when they are out on the doorsteps, but they vote another way in here when it really counts. "When they could make a difference, they turn the other way." "I say shame on him and shame on his party," Ms Reeves told MPs. But Mr Webb said: "We need action on overcrowding. We need fairness between social and private tenants. We need action on the deficit. "The party opposite has no answer to these problems. The coalition has answered them." The government defeated Labour's motion by 26 votes - less than its usual majority in Commons votes, which in normal circumstances is more than 50. An amendment tabled by Prime Minister David Cameron- which noted the "need to bring expenditure on housing benefit under control" - passed by 253 votes to 222 - a majority of 31. Twenty-one Lib Dems did not take part in either vote. It is unclear whether they abstained or had a prior reason to be absent. One Tory MP, Andrew Percy, formally abstained on Labour's motion by voting for and against it. Earlier, a separate Commons Early Day Motion - effectively an expression of opinion - tabled by four Lib Dem MPs, said the "under-occupancy penalty" had been a "mistake and should not have been introduced". Signed by Greg Mulholland, Ian Swales, Adrian Sanders and Roger Williams, it said more homes were empty as a result. It added that it would "not achieve the savings projected for it and that as constructed it is likely to have unforeseen consequences that will be unfair to certain groups and individuals". The alteration had the "perverse consequence that in some areas there are more larger properties now lying empty and with inadequate smaller housing", it said. </body>

      <body>In the face of the internet, mobiles and instant messaging you might expect the hobby of amateur radio - or ham radio as it's also known - to be on the decline. But in the last three years, the number of amateur radio licences has risen by over 8,000 - with 80,000 currently issued in the UK. Using designated frequencies, amateur radio enthusiasts communicate with people over the world. Many prefer the relaxed approach of 'rag chewing' or chatting at length with people, who often become friends - while at the opposite end of the spectrum 'contesters' compete to make as many contacts as possible in a given period. The hobby is also a public service, with Raynet (in the UK) stepping in during emergencies when regular communication networks fail. Amateur radio enthusiasts are currently contributing to relief efforts following Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. BBC News joined the Chorley and District Amateur Radio Society as they put on a special "Castles and Stately Homes On The Air (CASHOTA)" event at Astley Hall, a Grade I listed house in Lancashire. The club is keen to break down traditional stereotypes of amateur radio enthusiasts and offers free training courses to its members who range from 8 to 80. Video journalist: Neil Meads Stop/Start is a series of video features for the BBC News website which follows both new trends that are beginning and old traditions that are coming to an end. </body>

      <description>Your stories of sibling bullying - and the lasting pain</description>

      <body>A recent BBC News Magazine article asked when scrapping between siblings becomes bullying. Readers responded with stories of being bullied - as well as tales of being the bully. Deborah, US: My two sons (ages 17 and 16) got into such a fight in the car just this morning, I pulled them into the counsellor's office at school. It was a first for the school - which is a top-ranked high school in the US. Both my boys are well-known and well-liked at school, but privately we have a real problem. My oldest is a bully, my youngest is borderline autistic. It's beyond sibling rivalry - today the oldest was snarling in the youngest's ear like a psycho - "I'm going to kill you. I'm going to destroy your (new French) horn, I'm going to destroy ..." He couldn't get further because I ordered him to shut up or face criminal charges. I've had him sent to jail for three days once for stabbing his brother in the stomach with a pen. His temper is psychotic, he's even slapped me across the face, and his brother has been in terror, shaking all over, that John's going to do something to him. We have broken doors, walls, and furniture, and just this weekend the oldest smashed some of my favourite art while he was in a fit that I wasn't doing enough to help him apply to college. I've been trying to correct his behaviour all these years, and nothing seems to work - it just gets worse. Louise, UK: We bullied each other very badly. I had aggressive physical fights with my brother all the way into our mid-teens. He told me I was fat and ugly until after I left home and dropped to six stone, when he seemed to realise the effect of his words and wouldn't shut up about how thin I was. I was scared of him physically and so I made comments to try and dent his confidence. I suppose it was a self-perpetuating circle of his physically punishing me for my comments and me making comments to punish him for physically beating me. For my part, I said some absolutely unforgiveable things to him which even as an adult that I feel incapable of repeating because I still feel so ashamed. My brother and I now have very little contact. He's struggling with life and has struggled with drug problems, relationship and mental health issues. I feel responsible for this and I don't think I'll ever be able to let that guilt go but I don't know how to apologise or make up for the things I said and did. Kristina, US: As a young child I remember my brother (the middle child) beating me up, but in a playful manner. It was rarely, if ever, malicious. He would pick on me and call me names sometimes, as I was a chubby child. I had "dead arms" from my brother punching me in the same spot repeatedly. It could be deemed abuse by most researchers, but it made me a stronger person and built my character to withstand the real negative comments in school. Bullying is never okay. But you make the decision as to whether or not you let it bother you. Of course it stings for the moment, but if you don't react to it people generally stop and life goes on. Today, I am 24. I have a wonderful relationship with my brothers. Parents need to teach their kids to stand up for themselves in situations where it calls for it. They need to use their words and, as a last resort, actions. I always fought back against my brothers, I never let them win. Caroline, UK: I have hardly seen my sister in 30 years and I prefer it that way - as an adult I do not choose to live a life full of violence, rage, jealousy and bitterness. She is still the same jealous, deceitful, cruel bully as ever, but less violent than when we were growing up. As a young child she attacked me constantly, [she would] sneak up behind me and push me down flights of stairs, down concrete steps, off walls and even a bunk bed. My hearing has always been terrible, I had no idea she was behind me and at three years younger than her, I was a lot smaller and she was a lot stronger. On one occasion she slammed a glass door into me and my hand went through the glass. I had to remove the piece of glass that was sticking out of my wrist and then spent hours in A and E waiting for the deep lacerations to be stitched up. She broke, destroyed or sold most of my things and was always up to manipulative, devious, tricks and lies, including ripping up my books to ensure I got another beating from my mother, who she took after. My mother knew what my sister was doing and what was happening to me. However she preferred to drink with her friends and couldn't be bothered to deal with such a disturbed child who was such a nightmare to deal with; it was easier to target me. My childhood was a living hell because of this; I spent most of the time in a state of extreme terror and fear and suffered from chronic depression, anxiety, stress and insomnia, which I still suffer from as an adult. I regularly shook from head to foot with fear at the prospect of another beating, or another onslaught and if I wet my pants with terror I got another beating. I was very lucky not to have been killed, or permanently injured by the violent, relentless and persistent attacks; I would now describe their behaviour as psychotic. Kathy, UK: I was bullied by my older brother throughout my childhood. He was eight years older and put a lot of energy into bullying. He drew scary pictures on the wall near my bed when I was three years old. He used a soldering iron to write a horrible message - "you are a fat pig" - on a school pencil case my Mum made for me. At age 11 I remember wishing that I hadn't been born. I stopped speaking to him at home for two years. My parents did very little to stop it. Christmas was always ruined by it. I was also bullied at school but it wasn't as bad as the bullying at home. I suffered from depression for many years and have experienced workplace bullying and domestic violence. I know it is all connected to my childhood. Anne, UK: I am the eldest of five. The sister immediately after me (11 months younger) went through a phase of trying to boss all of us. According to my other siblings, she was particularly vicious with me. I can remember the feeling of helplessness because I was not believed and because I did not know how to defend myself. I tried to get my parents to help, but they just called me a drama queen... until my mother overheard my sister tell my brother to hit me with a wooden plank, and as he was very reluctant, she threatened him with breaking some toy. I love my sister, she is extraordinary in many respects, she has worked on aid projects in the Third World etc, and I think it was very positive that my parents put an immediate stop to her bullying and instilled proper moral values into her. But it left traces - our younger siblings were quite traumatised by the malice she exerted against me. Jack, UK: My older brother used to bully me all the time and at times it was actually quite horrific. But then I believe it's a natural part of sibling rivalry and as bad as it made me feel at the time, I know that I can face the worst of other people. We're now 19 and 23 and I would now consider him one of my best friends. Charlotte, UK: When we were growing up I used to hit my sister (hard) almost daily and whenever I think about it now I feel sick. Many years ago I apologised for my actions and she forgave me unconditionally, but the guilt never really goes away. I do my best to be a good sister and aunty to her son to make up for the past. I was hit by my brother who is eight years older than me on a regular basis, who in turn was hit by my father. I know I am to blame for my actions but I look back and wish an adult had put a stop to it. Don't allow your children to hit each other and punish them severely (without violence) when they do. The scars can last for life. Anonymous, 21 years of age: My brother is a contributing reason why I suffer from severe depression and self harm. There was nothing worse than coming back home after a day of being bullied at school, and on the way home from school, to then be bullied at home. He used to beat me around a lot while my mother was working and we were together. I was, and still am, scared of him, but to everyone else he is one of the nicest people they have ever met, he is popular and very social. Complete opposite to how he treated me. In turn, I have become very introverted. This has happened more recently too. Last year while I was coming out of severe depression he told me to kill myself on several occasions and hit me several times. I called the police about his violent outbursts on a number of occasions (he would also be violent towards my mother), but due to the fact that he was a sibling and not a spouse/partner they could not do anything against him on domestic violence grounds, only assault. He is a sibling in genetics and we occasionally talk, but I do not consider him my brother. June, UK: I was the third of five children. Our oldest brother was a bully and a pervert. The awful thing was that my mother favoured him against the other four. I can still remember one evening when big bro was supposed to be "in charge" of us - which meant he tried to beat us all up. Second-oldest brother decided he'd had enough and set about oldest brother with a poker. I was delighted, I regret to say. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <description>David Cameron's challenge in India</description>

      <body>Earlier this year, commuters in Delhi and other Indian cities were being offered attractive scenes of British life on street-side hoardings, buses and taxis - part of a global UK campaign to promote "Great Britain". The ads were slickly produced, but they looked oddly incongruous against the fierce contrasts of modern India - as if those behind this "Great" campaign weren't sure whom they were talking to here, or about what. Something similar has been going wrong in the UK's relations with India. Spearheaded by a clearly enthusiastic David Cameron, the package looks good on the surface. But from India's point of view, it doesn't do as advertised when you open it - largely because of a perception the UK is closing its doors to outsiders. A perception that is wrong, insist British diplomats. But as Mr Cameron responds to domestic pressures to cut immigration, he is facing increasing blowback abroad. And in a striking reversal of roles, it's left him looking like a slightly desperate suitor in Indian eyes, trying to persuade Britain's old colony to give him another chance. His third visit since taking office is proof, say UK officials, of his long-term commitment to India. But the papers here have pointedly noted their prime minister hasn't been to see him in the UK once. And privately, Indian officials are surprised Mr Cameron is back again - especially as the government may be on its last legs before elections in a few months time. "There will be no heavy-duty stuff on the agenda," said one senior official. "But we see the visit as a gesture of friendship to smooth over the bitterness that has crept in." This bad flavour is almost all to do with immigration. The number of Indian students going to the UK has tumbled by a quarter in the last year, with Britain's "stifling visa regime" getting the blame. "Good education has always been a British selling point," rues an Indian businessman whose son failed to get a UK visa. "Now we have to go elsewhere." UK officials say such stories are un-representative - and that 80% of Indian students who apply for visas get them. "The door is open to the best and brightest," says a senior diplomat, but admits, "there are misperceptions about our policies". But even when the UK recently abandoned its most controversial idea of demanding a £3,000 deposit or bond from Indians seeking a visa it got little credit. Perceptions won't shift, says Adrian Mutton of Delhi-based consultancy Sannam S4, unless Britain changes its immigration rhetoric. Its slogan - "we welcome the brightest and the best" - he argues, excludes many otherwise good students who "are still honest visa applicants, willing to invest tens of thousands into the UK via fees and living costs". Meanwhile, other Western countries with skills gaps are stepping up efforts to attract Indian students. There are knock-on effects. While Indian companies have bought up large tracts of British industry, when it comes to winning contracts here, UK companies often lose out. Yet, India still has deeper ties with Britain than with any other country outside South Asia. India wants to like the UK. But it wants to see more than the prime minister liking India back. </body>

      <description>Why the Japanese love ピーターラビット (Peter Rabbit)</description>

      <body>Once upon a time Beatrix Potter wrote a story about a naughty rabbit named Peter. Far away in Japan, he was so popular people flew half way around the world to buy key rings with his picture on. But why? The huddle of Japanese tourists appears from nowhere and waits patiently. They have come from Osaka and Tokyo to a small tourist attraction in the Lake District dedicated to this famous rabbit and his friends. It is Peter - and the shop - they want and I am delaying them by asking them why. But they smile and, via interpreter and tour guide Akiko Wada, politely offer shy descriptions of life-long adoration. Many, like Kazuko Kobayashi, read it in English as a child at school and now share it with their grandchildren. With a wry smile, her husband Iichi Kobayashi says he is here because she brought him. But he is still buying presents and admits the "impressive story" is very popular at home. Perhaps unfortunately for Mrs Tiggy-Winkle, Squirrel Nutkin and the rest of Peter Rabbit's cohort, the Japanese are only really interested in the bunny. Those at the World of Beatrix Potter are ready to buy anything with his image. They move round the displays in no time - considering how far they have come to see them - and descend on the shop. Deputy manager Stacey McShane is used to this speed. "They want to shop as soon as they come in. They go straight into the attraction and they're in and out, they go round the garden, take their pictures of all the characters as quickly as they can and then, once they're in the shop, it's whatever they can buy with Peter Rabbit on. "It's all little magnets or mirrors or pocket books that they can write in. They always buy about 20 of each - once one buys one, they all buy the same." Size is an issue - the smaller and sturdier the trinket the better it fits in a suitcase. Mrs McShane believes if they did not have to transport their purchases back to Japan "they would buy the shop out, they would buy everything". And they already buy a lot, she says. In groups, they are the attraction's best customers "by far". Three days a week, every week, right through the season. They are "very, very" polite and inclined to make "little origami things" for shop staff while they wait to pay. The attraction does not take the interest for granted, however, and managers make trips to Japan every few years to meet tour operators face to face and make sure Peter Rabbit stays on their itineraries. The chief executive of the attraction is on a trade mission in Tokyo to encourage even more Japanese tourists to visit the Lake District. "It might seem odd to be travelling 6,000 miles to a very different culture in order to promote my business," Andy Poole says. "Japan, however, is unlike any other of our overseas markets in that it has a huge affinity with one of Miss Potter's characters in particular, Peter Rabbit. "We welcome some 15,000 visitors from Japan every year, so for us it is very big business." This tour is small by usual standards - only about 10 when 30 or more is not unknown - but it fills the little gift shop. Fujiko Miyazawa is adding to her collection of Peter Rabbit dishes, cups, and "so many pretty things". She is well travelled but has always "longed" to make the trip here, even though supply is plentiful back home. The Japanese passion for all things Peter Rabbit extends to themed shops, restaurants and hotels. There is a replica of Beatrix Potter's house Hill Top, a theme park and a series of Mr McGregor's gardens in one of the country's largest banks. Requests to use the name are sanctioned - or not - through a complicated chain of command that stems down from publishers Frederick Warne via Silvergate Media, who are responsible for global merchandising, and their agent in Japan, Sony Creative Products. Their figures suggest 80% of the population have heard of Peter Rabbit - but why are people interested? What is it about a 120-year-old disobedient animal that has them flocking? Makiko Tanaka, from Sony's content marketing department, says rabbits are very popular in Japan - after bears - because they are "small, fluffy and cute". This particular rabbit taps "a certain admiration or yearning for European culture which is very different from ours". Potter's "British cynicism" or "British way of thinking" is also attractive, she says, especially to the young. "People here think it's mean to refer to Peter's father by a pie, though it came from the original book. I understand it's a sort of euphemism to tell Peter not to go to Mr McGregor's garden, but it's a shock for some Japanese especially who do know Peter Rabbit as a cute character, but do not know the story." Yuriko Allen, a Japanese woman who now lives in Gateshead, says the character is "really famous for baby goods" but also acceptable for adults. She says Peter Rabbit's combination of being "cute" and at the same time not entirely childish is appealing. In a world where many characters aimed at children are bright to the point of garish, she is not the only one to mention the draw of the soft, subtle colours. A Japanese travel operator, Kimoko Ikegami, sums it up like this: "Peter Rabbit is so cute, but he also is very British and people in Japan admire both of those qualities. The books were translated into Japanese 40 years ago and were an instant hit with children of that generation. We have read them ever since." So, Peter Rabbit is cute, British, natural, pastel-coloured, cynical and a guaranteed draw. But his uses are not limited to key rings, toys and a name that will bring in customers. In June 2006 a replica of Potter's house, Hill Top Farm, was recreated, brick-for brick, in Saitama Children's Zoo, an hour from Tokyo. It is "remarkably similar" to the original, says George Wallace, who helps run it. He is associate professor of English and American Literature at nearby Daito Bunka University, which built the replica to house its Beatrix Potter reference library. "On the inside, however, it is a modern museum, built to withstand earthquakes - fingers crossed. We have tried to give the interior an English feel by using materials brought over from the UK, for example the slate floor, the wallpaper, the wooden staircase," he says. "At first I found the popularity of Peter Rabbit rather bizarre. His face appears on all manner of things, often on plates for some reason." But now, 25 years after moving to Japan, the obsession is "just part of the fabric of my everyday life". Meanwhile, in Tokyo, Shino Morishige, who runs Peter Rabbit Flowers, is pleased she went to the trouble of seeking official approval to use the name for her florist shop. It is one up on the other shops and, after all, he is the "most famous rabbit in the world". </body>

      <title>An age-old assumption</title>
      <description>Theory of dependent older people turned on its head</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24921171</url>

      <body>The idea that dependent older people represent a great demographic challenge of our age has been turned on its head. Academics from the University of Edinburgh argue numbers have actually been falling in Britain and the ratio of working adults to dependent pensioners is improving. The research questions an assumption behind arguments for health, social care and immigration policies. The findings were published in the British Medical Journal. "The extent, speed and effect of population ageing have all been exaggerated and we should not assume that it will strain health and social care systems," Professor John MacInnes and senior research fellow Jeroen Spijker write in the article 'Population Ageing: The timebomb that isn't?' The mistake people have been making, the paper suggests, is to assume that all pensioners are dependent and all working-age adults are workers. They point out that, while it is true there are now more people over 65 in the UK than children under 15, rising life expectancy means older people are effectively "younger", healthier and fitter than previous generations. Instead of simply looking at how old someone is, the research focuses on how long they might be expected to live. "Many behaviours and attitudes (including those related to health) are more strongly linked to remaining life expectancy than to age," it says. In 1841, life expectancy at birth was 40 years for males and 42 years for females. By 1900 it was 52 and 57 and today it is 79 and 83. So the point at which we enter 'old age' has also been changing. Equally, using age to define the adult working populations makes little sense, the authors suggest, because "there are more dependents of working age (9.5 million) than there are older people who do not work". So they calculated an alternative measure, what they call "the real elderly dependency ratio", based on the sum of men and women with a remaining life expectancy of up to 15 years divided by the number of people in employment, irrespective of age. Using this measure, the paper calculates that old-age dependency in the UK fell by one third over the past four decades - and is likely to stabilise close to its current level. The measure suggests similar falls in many other countries. "Our calculations show that - over the past four decades - the population far from ageing, has in fact been getting younger, with increasing numbers of people in work for every older person or child," the authors say. "The different story of population ageing told by our real elderly dependency ratio has several important implications for health policy and clinical practice." In policy terms, this analysis to one of the central challenges of an ageing population might be something of a game changer. Rather than seeing longevity itself as an expensive problem, focus could shift towards managing morbidity and remaining life expectancy. The paper demands society rethink some of its assumptions about elderly dependency - drawing a distinction between the 'young old' and the 'old old', if you like. The census in 2011 showed that 1.4 million people of state pension age in the UK were in employment - almost double what it was just two decades earlier. Of those aged between 65 and 74, 16% were economically active at the last count. Just over half of all pensioners describe themselves as being in good health and, while demand for elderly care services is rising, the BMJ article suggests the key drivers in deciding the impact on care budgets will be medical knowledge and technology. </body>

      <body>After 25 years playing the Belgian detective, David Suchet is preparing to say goodbye to Hercule Poirot as the iconic character attempts to solve his final case on the small screen. Curtain: Poirot's Last Case will see the elderly detective call on old friend Captain Hastings (Hugh Fraser) for assistance as they return to the scene of their first case, Styles Court, to try to prevent another murder. Times have changed irrevocably since Suchet first graced our television screens in the now world-famous role back in 1989. But the actor, 67, believes the public's appetite for the gentle drama is as strong as it ever was. "Crime drama… has changed completely… it's become very dark and extraordinarily violent," says Suchet. "That's not the world of Agatha Christie and the fact that he's still so popular must say a lot about the public - that they actually don't need the blood and gore and the sex and the drama." Nevertheless, Suchet will not be reprising his role in any future television versions of Poirot, having filmed every book Christie wrote around the character. "It's grieving. I'm saying goodbye to a character I've been and have got to know over 25 years… it's goodbye to a best friend as an actor, as someone I've got to know. "But everything has its time and this is the right time, there are no more Agatha Christie films to make. So that's it." Interestingly, Suchet credits a "dreadful performance" in an earlier Poirot TV film with helping him establish himself in the title role of the long-running ITV series. He was first spotted by members of the Agatha Christie estate, including her granddaughter, in 1985's Blott on the Landscape. "Then they saw me give the dreadful performance I gave in Peter Ustinov's Poirot film Thirteen at Dinner. I played Inspector Japp and it was the worst performance I've ever given," he says candidly. "It was a good thing I gave such a bad performance because they went on to make a series of films with Peter Ustinov for American television. "If I'd have been brilliant as Inspector Japp, I would have carried on [in that role] and I would never have been accepted to play Poirot." Endearingly, Suchet speaks of Poirot like an old friend as he explains why the detective still attracts so many fans. "He has an enormous charm… he loves people, he has a wonderful ear and he listens well. "For women, he has no ulterior motive… if a young lady was drunk in the street at two o'clock in the morning and he found her, she would feel perfectly safe, he would be totally honourable. He is asexual," says Suchet. "My son-in-law described him as the greatest moral compass," he adds fondly. The actor says that when he watches early re-runs of Poirot, he realises "it has changed. He's more settled now, more mature in himself. "I think he's less performed, he's been fleshed out a little bit. We've got more of his loneliness and his darker side, which is what Agatha Christie wrote." Suchet says that because he "never knew from one year or the next whether I would be playing him again… I never had any options taken out on me, it was just whether the phone would ring or not," it prevented him from the actor's curse - being typecast. "By me not knowing [if I would play him again], I could take all those wonderful theatre roles like Oleanna [directed by Harold Pinter in 1993], Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf with Diana Rigg, Amadeus, Arthur Miller's All My Sons opposite Zoe Wanamaker, and Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey Into Night. "My character acting has been… enhanced by Poirot, because he's given me the profile - people will use me because Poirot has been successful." On Wednesday, Suchet and his wife "will do what we've done every first night of Poirot on television. "We won't record it, we'll sit there with one glass of wine and just watch it and toast each other at the end and say 'that's it'." So what next, now that the debonair detective has been put to bed? Next year Suchet will embark on a world tour of The Last Confession, a play he starred in at London's Theatre Royal Haymarket and the Chichester Festival Theatre. The actor describes it as "a Vatican mystery about John Paul I who was Pope for 33 days". "My wife [Sheila Ferris] is going to be in the play with me - she's playing the only nun. It gives me a chance to say thank you to all those countries who have watched my Poirot." It is very much evident that thoughts of slowing down and lessening his workload are far from Suchet's mind. "People don't really retire in my business - the phone just stops ringing! If it stops ringing for 15 years and you're still alive I suppose that could be called honourable retirement," he jokes. "If you don't want to work, all you have to say is 'no' which is the hardest word in the English language for any actor. I'll be saying yes for hopefully a few more years." Curtain: Poirot's Last Case airs at 20:00 GMT on 13 November on ITV. David Suchet's book, Poirot and Me, is out now. </body>

      <description>Papers focus on typhoon plight of Philippines children</description>

      <body>Efforts to help the survivors of Typhoon Haiyan, which wreaked devastation across the Philippines, continue to feature heavily on the UK's front pages. The Sun's use of photographs of children affected by the storm is particularly effective. Likewise, the Mail focuses on the plight of the young, via an inside spread headlined: "Suffering of the storm children." Meanwhile, the Times reports from the scene of one of the worst-hit areas - the city of Tacloban - where Richard Lloyd Parry describes the "mortal decay" on the streets, four days after the typhoon hit. "The most awful thing about the typhoon is not the fact of death, but the hundred thousand living tragedies unfolding invisibly, and without prospect of any immediate improvement," he writes. Other papers focus on the aid effort, with the Daily Express reporting how musician Myleene Klass, whose mother is Filipina, led calls for Britons to donate. The Disasters Emergency Committee appeal yielded a "staggering" £1.5m in the first 15 hours, it notes. The Independent makes effective use of an image of Nobel prize winning physicist Prof Peter Higgs at London's Science Museum. He's pictured standing in front of a photograph of the Large Hadron Collider, which is said to have proven his prediction of the existence of the "God particle" that gives all other particles mass, the Higgs boson. "I was quite worried at one time that the importance of the discovery of this particular particle was being overplayed," he's quoted as saying. It seems cosmologist Stephen Hawking was another well-known scientist to have reservations about the boson. The Guardian quotes him as saying: "The discovery of the new particle came at a personal cost. I had a bet with Gordon Kane of Michigan University that the Higgs particle wouldn't be found. The Nobel prize cost me $100." And Hawking went further, the Daily Mail notes, complaining that physics "would be far more interesting if it had not been found". For a second day, the future of the NHS features heavily in reports. This time it's proposals to shake up hospital casualty departments, with the Telegraph leading on the idea of creating a "two-tier" system, with specialist treatment concentrated in fewer locations. The Guardian says the suggestions of NHS England medical director Sir Bruce Keogh would result in about 40 to 70 becoming "major emergency centres" with hi-tech treatment for heart attacks, stroke and trauma, and the remainder designated as ordinary emergency centres for less specialised care. "The proposals will... be controversial because some AandEs will be seen to be downgraded," it says. King's Fund think-tank senior fellow Nigel Edwards, writing in the Independent, agrees. However, he says the logic in this "very sensible report" is sound. James Rampton, reviewing the papers for the BBC News Channel, said people would have to acknowledge there was no "bottomless pit" of NHS resources. However, his co-panellist Neil Midgley foresaw problems for ministers if things went wrong. "The problem comes three or five years down the track when people start dying in ambulances on the way to specialist care centres. There will be headlines about postcode lotteries," he said. Broadcaster David Dimbleby's scorpion tattoo continues to cause much debate - and mirth - in the press. Daily Telegraph cartoonist Adams presents Dimbleby among a line-up of public figures - David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nigel Farage - and invites readers to "match the tattoos". Their choices include a hammer and sickle, a pint wrapped in a Union Jack and the phrase "Number 10". Meanwhile, the Times repeats claims that the scorpion is used by the gay community as a warning that the wearer is HIV positive. In the Daily Mirror, Paul Routledge - "who incidentally had the white rose of Yorkshire tattooed on his arm at the age of 40 while slightly inebriated" - wonders what all the fuss is about, saying "oldies" can't get enough excitement. It's a far cry, he says, from his childhood when pensioners were supposed to "sit in the ante-room of death and not make any fuss until it was your turn". On the same page, however, Countdown host Nick Hewer disagrees: "Once the body ages... the whole thing sags and it looks horrible. Presumably David is working on the basis that his body is already as saggy as it's ever going to get." But Grace Dent, in the Independent, says Dimbleby's inking "marked the tipping point where anyone deciding to daub something on their skin permanently... can claim it to be in the least shocking or anarchic". Dent is one of a number of commentators attacking a trial that encourages new mothers in low-income areas to breastfeed by offering them up to £200 in store vouchers. She uses her Independent column to describe the breastfeeding lobby as "a bunch of stay-at-home mums who spend their time disseminating guilt and shame to the poor". Social commentator Debbi Marco, writing in the Express, brands the scheme a "bribe" and a waste of taxpayers' money. "This trial misses the fundamental problem with breastfeeding which is that it is incredibly difficult, so much so many women struggle to breastfeed beyond the first few weeks regardless of how many shopping vouchers are waved under their noses." The Sun's agony aunt Deidre Sanders describes herself as a "believer" in breastfeeding. But she says: "I hate all the anxiety and the pressure that has grown up around the subject." Mothers who find they cannot breastfeed "are not failures, their babies can still thrive", she adds. An animal welfare professor is quoted in the Times suggesting that since battery farms were outlawed in the European Union, life for free-range laying hens may not be as good as that for their counterparts in cages. Christine Nicol's research contradicts the advice of welfare charities by suggesting birds kept in barns have a higher rate of poor plumage, old fractures, emaciation and signs of stress than those in "enriched cages" with space, a perch and things they can scratch on, the report says. Meanwhile, the Daily Mail is among those papers recording how Prince Charles speaks out about supermarkets' treatment of Britain's farmers, in an editorial as guest editor of Country Life magazine. "It cannot be right that a typical hill farmer earns just £12,600, with some surviving on as little as £8,000 a year, whilst the big retailers do so much better out of the deal, having taken none of the risk," the prince writes. The Mail also reports how Charles had an unfortunate day in the jungle in India, where he had to tramp through mud in his white suede shoes. And, as the Mirror notes, he fared little better when trying to spot elephants - blaming the presence of hundreds of security personnel providing his security for ruining his chances of seeing the wild animals. Hairdressers are in the news, with the Daily Mail reporting the results of a study by an internet voucher firm that the average British woman "keeps" her stylist for longer than she stays married to her husband. And the Express rounds up the views of various well-coiffured celebrities and columnists on the issue, with novelist Kathy Lette declaring: "Your hairdresser is all the things a husband isn't: continually pleasant, constantly available, full of flattery and a devoted confidant." TV presenter Richard Madeley, meanwhile, says that if his hairdresser - Susan - was unavailable when he needed her, he "would be thrown", adding: "I wouldn't know what to do." Meanwhile, the Mirror uses stylist Nicky Clarke's BBC Four programme Bouffants, Beehives and Bobs: The Hairstyles That Shaped Britain to run through its favourite "dos" from down the years. It picks 19, taking in Twiggy's Eton Crop, Dusty Springfield's Beehive, David Bowie's Mullet and Jennifer Aniston's Rachel. On the back pages, Sun Sport claims an exclusive with a report that former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini wants to sign Chelsea stalwart John Terry for Turkish side Galatasaray. But the Telegraph is more interested in another transfer of a long-serving star away from Chelsea, to the extent it makes the front page. Presenter Alan Titchmarsh will be absent from the BBC's Chelsea Flower Show coverage for the first time in 30 years, it says. But while the Times suggests he may have been "pruned", the Telegraph quotes a corporation spokesman as saying it was "entirely his decision" to leave. </body>

      <title>Obituary: Sir John Tavener</title>
      <description>Singular voice of composer Sir John Tavener, who has died at 69</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10881314</url>
      <date>1384277361</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/48621000/jpg/_48621988_44481215.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Sir John Tavener was a composer who wove spirituality and mysticism into his writing. His early avant garde works contrasted strongly with the later pieces for which he became better known. Sir John was born on 28 January 1944 in London, a direct descendant of the 16th Century composer John Tavener. A skilled pianist and organist, he went to school in Highgate, North London, before going on to study at the Royal Academy of Music. Sir John first came to public attention in 1968 with the premiere of his oratorio, The Whale. The work, based on the biblical story of Jonah, was played at the debut concert of the London Sinfonietta and later recorded on the Beatles' Apple label. In 1977, he became a convert to the Russian Orthodox Church, having been persuaded that Eastern traditions retained an essence that had been lost in the west. Already a deeply religious man, his faith became an increasingly important part of his life and works and he once described music as "the essence of God". "Through the very fact that I write sacred music, my concern with music and God take place all the time," he said. His works from this period reflect this new influence in his life, particularly The Lamb, based on the William Blake poem of the same name, and the choral work Resurrection. His music was introduced to a new audience in 1989 when the premiere of The Protecting Veil was played at the BBC Proms by the London Symphony Orchestra. In 1992, he was nominated for the prestigious Mercury Prize - and again in 1997 - ultimately losing out to Primal Scream and drum and bass producer Roni Size. In 1994, he celebrated his 50th birthday with The Apocalypse, another major commission for the Proms. The popularity of his works was highlighted in 1997 when his piece A Song for Athene, was performed at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales. Sir John dedicated his piece Eternity's Sunrise, based on poetry by William Blake, to the memory of the late Princess. The premiere of A New Beginning played out the final minutes of the 20th Century at the Millennium Dome in London and he was knighted in the New Year's Honours List. Five days later, Fall and Resurrection received its premiere at St Paul's Cathedral and was broadcast on both television and radio. His work remained much in demand with the San Francisco-based Chanticleer commissioning Lamentations and Praises. Their subsequent recording won the Grammy award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition in 2003. Although he remained an Orthodox Christian, Tavener increasingly explored the beliefs of other faiths in his music. The Veil of the Temple uses both Christian and Islamic texts while Hymn of Dawn contains Hindu, Sufi and Jewish influences as well as the music of native American tradition. In 2007, the BBC Symphony Orchestra premiered his work The Beautiful Names, which is based on the 99 names of Allah from the Koran. His Requiem, commissioned for the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus and performed at Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral in February 2008, won widespread acclaim. Ill health, however, dogged him most of his life. He suffered from Marfan Syndrome, an inherited condition that attacks the body's connective tissue. Having survived a major stroke at the age of 30, he suffered a heart attack in December 2007. Critics often suggested that Tavener's music was not influenced by religion but was merely a substitute for it, complaining that his minimalism was just "simple music for simple desires." Tavener dismissed this as pure cynicism. "We're literally living in a dark age," he once said. "Anything that comes from anywhere that has a spark of the divine is worth taking." In June 2013, he premiered three new works, all written after his heart attack, at the Manchester International Festival. They included one based on a "rather terrifying" short story by Leo Tolstoy, The Death of Ivan Ilyich, in which the central character seeks redemption as he stares into the void of death. He told the BBC at the time: "When I became ill in Switzerland and I became conscious for the first time, the religious zeal that I had before, I found had gone." He continued: "But so had my ability to write music. It was about three years without doing anything, I just wanted to lie in a darkened room. And the faith came back in a different way, with writing. "I think I've been very lucky all my life because the writing and the faith seem to go together." </body>

      <title>SSE in price vow over green levies</title>
      <description>SSE becomes the latest of the big energy companies to say it will adjust its prices if the government cuts green levies.</description>

      <body>SSE has become the latest of the big energy companies to say it will adjust its prices if the government cuts green levies. SSE's Alan Young told BBC Radio 5 live that if the levies were cut, "we will adjust our bills accordingly - no ifs, no buts". Both Npower and EDF made similar comments on Tuesday. E.On has already promised to cut its bills "pound for pound, penny for penny" if levies are reduced. SSE is due to increase its average energy tariffs by 8.2% from 15 November. SSE's comments came as the firm reported pre-tax profits of £336.4m for the six months to 30 September. Stripping out one-off items, SSE's underlying profits fell to £354m from £400.8m in the same period a year ago. The company said that its retail business recorded an £89.4m operating loss, and within this its energy supply division made a loss of £115.4m, compared with a profit of £48.3m a year earlier. SSE said this reflected "the impact of higher wholesale gas, distribution, environmental and social costs". However, the company is increasing its dividend by 3.2% to 26 pence a share. Mr Young told the BBC: "Profit that we make has a purpose. In the last five years we have invested £2.5bn more in the energy networks and in the power generation in this country than we've made in profit after tax." In the past few weeks, five of the "big six" energy companies have announced price rises, blaming the government's social and environmental policies for some of the increases. However, the green levies account for just 8% of the average energy bill, so there is limited capacity to reduce the increases already announced. Nevertheless Npower said on Tuesday that if the cuts went through as anticipated, it would reduce its planned price increase from 10.4% to 6%. Smaller energy companies are already protected from many of the green levies. Those with fewer than 250,000 customers do not pay the Energy Companies Obligation (ECO) or the Warm Home Discount. As a result smaller companies may have less scope to cut bills, should levies be changed. The government will make an announcement in the Autumn Statement on 5 December. It has also announced a review of the way that competition is working in the market. Labour has said that it will freeze gas and electricity bills for 20 months if it wins the 2015 election. </body>

      <body>Sainsbury's has reported a half-year pre-tax profit of £433m, up 9.1% from the same period in 2012. The supermarket giant said the results were "strong" considering the "tough trading environment". Like-for-like sales, which strip out the impact of new stores, were up 1.4% excluding fuel. Sainsbury's has now overtaken Asda and moved into the number two spot for the largest supermarket in the UK, second to Tesco. Total sales for the 28 weeks to 28 September rose 4.4% to £13.9bn. Online sales were up 15% while sales at its convenience stores rose more than 20%. Chief executive Justin King said the firm's share of the grocery market was at its highest for a decade, after 35 consecutive quarters of like-for-like sales growth. But Mr King told the BBC that the retailer still had a long way to go to catch Tesco in terms of sales. He said customers still had less money to spend after the recession. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: "Without question, this is a strong performance from a resurgent Sainsbury's." However, he added that "intense competition, rising commodity prices and the group's sole UK focus limited its scope for further expansion". In October, Tesco reported a 23.5% drop in profits for the first half of its financial year to £1.39bn, which it said was down to a challenging retail environment, particularly in Europe. </body>

      <title>Starbucks to pay $3bn over Kraft row</title>
      <description>Starbucks has been ordered to pay almost $3bn in damages and other costs in a dispute with Kraft Foods over packaged coffee.</description>

      <body>An independent US arbitrator has told Starbucks to pay $2.76bn (£1.74bn) in damages and other costs to Kraft Foods in a dispute over packaged coffee. Kraft began selling bags of Starbucks branded coffee in 1998 under a deal that was due to run until March 2014. But the US coffee chain ended the contract in 2010, accusing Kraft of breaking the terms of their deal. Kraft challenged that move by starting arbitration proceedings saying it had built a business worth $500m a year. On Tuesday the arbitrator ruled that Starbucks must pay $2.23bn in damages plus $527m in interest and legal costs. Kraft Foods was spun off by Mondelez International last year and under an agreement between those two firms the payments from the case will go to Mondelez. "We're pleased that the arbitrator validated our position that Starbucks breached our successful and long-standing contractual relationship without proper compensation," said Mondelez. In a statement Starbucks said it "strongly disagreed" with the conclusions of the arbitrator. "We believe Kraft did not deliver on its responsibilities to our brand under the agreement, the performance of the business suffered as a result, and that we had a right to terminate the agreement without payment to Kraft," it said. </body>

      <title>Probe into currency market 'widens'</title>
      <description>An investigation into possible manipulation of the currency market has been expanded to 15 banks according to the Financial Times.</description>

      <body>A global investigation into alleged currency-market manipulation has been expanded to 15 of the world's biggest banks, the Financial Times says. The probe now includes euro-dollar trading, the biggest part of the market, according to the London-based newspaper. Last month Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it was examining whether traders had colluded. Regulators in Switzerland, Hong Kong and the US are also involved. The global foreign exchange market is worth more than $5tn a day, and London is the most important hub, accounting for about 40% of all foreign-exchange trading. Several banks have confirmed that they are co-operating with the investigation, including Royal Bank of Scotland, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Barclays. Earlier this month Barclays suspended six traders as part of a probe into suggestions that currency markets could have been rigged. Suspicions of exchange rate manipulation centre on a one-minute window of trading at 16:00 every day that is used to set exchange rates. The suggestion is that traders colluded to push through high volumes of trades in the run-up to and during the window to influence rates. Last month Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) suspended two traders in connection with the investigation into the currency markets. </body>

      <body>Shop stewards at Portsmouth dockyard will find out later whether there is a future for shipbuilding in the city. They are due to meet with BAE Systems management on Wednesday to hear the outcome of two days of talks. Last week the defence giant announced plans to cut 1,775 jobs at its sites in Scotland and southern England, where building would cease altogether. However union officials say they have not yet given up hope of retaining some shipbuilding at the south coast yard. Discussions at BAE Systems' Farnborough headquarters between the union and bosses broke up earlier with neither side giving much away. The results of the talks will be put to workers at mass meetings in Hampshire and on Clydeside on Thursday morning. BAE - which employs 1,200 people in Portsmouth and 3,200 across its Govan, Scotstoun, Rosyth and Filton sites - has said it will end shipbuilding on the south coast in the second half of next year. It plans to transfer the remaining work, on the Royal Navy's two Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers, to Govan and Scotstoun. The move threatens 940 staff jobs at the Portsmouth yard and a further 835 in Glasgow, Rosyth and Filton in Bristol. BAE says the cuts are necessary because of a "significant" fall off in demand. Meanwhile, Minister for Cities Greg Clark has said parts of a regeneration deal signed between the government and Portsmouth were included because of the BAE job cuts. The so-called "city deal" is aimed at boosting employment and development in the area. </body>

      <body>Npower says it will cut its planned rise in its average gas and electricity energy bill to 6% from 10.4% if the government reduces green levies. Npower's move follows EDF Energy's plan to raise its average dual-fuel bill by 3.9% - less than half that of rivals. EDF is anticipating cuts to government levies, but warns that if that does not happen then customers can expect steeper increases in energy bills. In contrast Npower said it would only act when the green taxes were cut. Currently around 6% of a gas bill and 11% of an electricity bill go to government schemes aimed at saving energy, reducing emissions and tackling climate change. "If the levy comes down, the price will come down," Guy Esnouf, Npower's director of external communications told the BBC. "Unlike EDF we don't really think it's right to talk now about government policies that haven't changed but making that assumption, and that's not something we'll do in advance, then on the same basis as EDF, our price would go up net around 6%," added Mr Esnouf. Npower currently plans to raise its average dual-fuel bill by 10.4% from 1 December. Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged to "roll back" green energy levies. The government is currently reviewing its environmental policies to see if they can be delivered more cost-effectively. If the government makes bigger changes to the costs of its social and environmental schemes than EDF expects, it said it would pass these savings onto customers However, EDF warned that if the government failed to reduce green levies, the firm might have to put up its prices further. "If changes to social and environmental programmes are less than anticipated, the company may have to review its standard variable prices again," it said in a statement. Energy Secretary Ed Davey told the BBC he welcomed the fact that one of the big six suppliers had produced a price rise closer to inflation. "Now people will see they have [a] choice. It isn't just the smaller suppliers offering lower prices," he added. He also warned that energy firms needed to "respond to customers' concerns" if they wanted to avoid damaging their reputation. Mr Davey's warning came on the day energy bosses sought to defend their industry in a bid to end political criticism of their companies. At the annual conference of industry body Energy UK, Mr Davey said that power firms should not treat the public as a "cash cow". In response, Energy UK said the industry was "already working hard to ensure everyone can keep the lights on and stay warm this winter". "The best way to do this is for everyone to work together, which is why this tit-for-tat Punch and Judy show of insults is so unproductive," a spokesman said. EDF, which has 3.7 million residential customers, is the latest energy provider to increase its prices. SSE said it would increase prices by 8.2% from 15 November, British Gas's prices are due to rise by 9.2% on 23 November, Npower said its dual-fuel bills will go up by 10.4% on 1 December and Scottish Power's price rise will be 8.6% for dual-fuel energy bills from 6 December. </body>

      <title>Energy bill hikes 'to last 17 years'</title>
      <description>Consumers face 17 more years of above-inflation increases in energy and water bills, Whitehall's spending watchdog warns.</description>

      <body>Consumers face 17 more years of above-inflation increases in energy and water bills as they help pay for the renewal of the UK's infrastructure, Whitehall's spending watchdog has warned. The National Audit Office added that "gaps" in the official analysis meant government lacked "an overall picture of affordability". It expressed particular concern about low-income households. But the government said it was "committed" to keeping bills down. Fuel costs have become a highly charged political issue in recent months. Five of the UK's six main energy companies have announced price rises, at an average of 8.1%. On Tuesday, EDF Energy became the latest provider to increase bills, by an average of 3.9%. Alan Young, from energy company SSE, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "Standards in this industry do need to improve." But he denied his company was trying to make a "quick buck" from its customers. "We're interested in making a sustainable profit that allows us to invest in the long term," he said. "This country has had reliable supplies of energy. When people have gone to switch the lights on, they have come on. "Have there been shortcomings in standards? Absolutely. Is there a commitment on our part to improve them? Totally. "But fundamentally people have got reliable supplies of energy for their money. We're concerned that they should continue to do so, but in a way that is affordable." In September, Labour leader Ed Miliband announced plans for a 20-month energy price freeze from May 2015, should his party win the next election. And the government has launched a competition review and will review green and social charges, responsible for some of the cost of bills. In an escalation of rhetoric, Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey told an industry conference on Tuesday that firms should not use customers as "cash cows". The Treasury estimates that at least two-thirds of the £310bn of planned infrastructure investment over the next decade and beyond will come from private companies, ultimately paid for by consumers. In its report, the National Audit Office (NAO) said it was estimated there would be an 18% average real-terms increase in household energy bills between now and 2030. For water, the figure would be 28%. The NAO also said: "Affordability can only be assessed taking into account all household bills, household incomes and wider costs of living. "Gaps in analysis, and the lack of a common approach to measuring affordability, mean that the government does not have an overall picture of affordability, either for the average household or for those on low incomes." The NAO expressed particular concern about the plight of the low-income households where energy and water bills accounted for 15% of spending in 2011 - almost double the overall average of 8% - while their incomes had fallen by 11% in real terms since 2002. A Conservative source said: "We agree with the NAO that government should 'rigorously scrutinise all decisions on both value for money and affordability grounds', that is why the prime minister has announced that we need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills at the Autumn Statement." And a government spokesman said: "Decades of underinvestment have left the UK struggling with insufficient energy infrastructure, but we are committed to fixing the failures of previous governments, and to making the difficult decisions that will allow us to have the infrastructure we need. "The government is committed to supporting hard-working families and that's why we're cutting tax for 25 million people and taking 2.7 million people out of income tax altogether by 2014, helping the most vulnerable with their bills, freezing fuel duty and sticking to the economic plan that has got all sectors of the economy growing." </body>

      <body>Singapore Airlines (SIA) has reported a 78% rise in net profit for its second quarter. Asia's second biggest carrier was boosted by the sale of aircraft, spare engines as well as increased passenger traffic. The firm posted a total net profit of $128.6m (£80.9m) for the quarter, up from $72.1m a year earlier. But it warned it was facing tough competition and a strong Singapore dollar. The carrier said its advance bookings for the coming months are projected to be higher compared to the same period last year. But it said promotional activities required to match its competition would likely put pressure on yields. Earlier this year SIA raised its investment in Virgin Australia, buying an additional 9.9% stake for $126m, taking its total holding to 19.9%. </body>

      <title>Chinese leaders unveil reforms</title>
      <description>China's leaders end a crucial meeting by announcing a series of economic reforms aimed at overhauling the world's second largest economy.</description>

      <body>China's leaders have unveiled a series of reforms aimed at overhauling its economy over the next decade. In a statement issued after a closed-door summit, they promised the free market would play a bigger role. A new committee will oversee internal security to guard against social unrest, and farmers will be given more property rights over their land. A BBC correspondent says the leaders will now have to persuade officials below them to implement the reforms. The so-called Third Plenum talks began in Beijing on Friday, and ended with a brief communique outlining areas that had been agreed on. The BBC's Celia Hatton in Beijing says the reforms could carry enormous importance - a more complete list of changes to the economy and the social sector is expected to be released in the coming days, or even weeks. Details of what was agreed are still emerging. The Communist Party leaders said markets would be allowed to play a leading role. State ownership would remain a pillar of the economy. "The core issue is to straighten out the relationship between government and the market, allowing the market to play a decisive role in allocating resources and improving the government's role," the statement said, Reuters news agency reports. Our correspondent says the party is vowing to carry out deep reforms across the economy and the government to reach a "new stage of development". A lengthy television story heading China's flagship state newscast showed rows of Communist Party officials, including Chairman Xi Jinping, sitting at long tables studying paper documents in front of them. The report contained a long list of vague party pledges - from a plan to create a modern military to one that encourages foreign investment in China's coastal cities, our correspondent adds. Other changes include promises to institute stronger systems to check corruption. Ahead of the meeting another area expected to be discussed was China's household registration system. The meeting was being closely watched after senior Communist Party official Yu Zhengsheng said last month that "unprecedented" economic and social reforms would be discussed at the meeting. Analysts did not expect any political reforms to be on the agenda. How successful the reforms turn out to be remains to be seen. It will take time to assess their impact. And where economic or social reforms are agreed, local officials and groups with vested interests may be reluctant to implement them, correspondents say. Third Plenums refer to the third time new leaders of China lead a plenary session of the Central Committee. They generally take place a year after new leaders take office, after they have established their power base. Previous Third Plenums have had a major impact on China's development. At the Third Plenum in 1978, former leader Deng Xiaoping announced the opening-up of China's economy, spearheading major market-oriented reforms. In 1993's Third Plenum, former leader Zhu Rongji announced the "socialist market economy" and dismantled a large part of China's state-owned sector. Security was tight in Beijing for the meeting, with tensions higher than usual in the wake of an incident on 28 October in Tiananmen Square and bomb blasts in the north of the country days after. Five people were killed in what Chinese officials called a "terrorist attack" incited by extremists from the western region of Xinjiang when a car drove through crowds and burst into flames near an entrance to the Forbidden City. Less than a week later, a series of small blasts killed at least one person outside a provincial office of the ruling Communist Party in Shanxi province. </body>

      <title>Inflation falls to 2.2% in October</title>
      <description>The UK's inflation rate, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), fell to 2.2% in October from 2.7% the month before.</description>

      <body>The UK's inflation rate, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), fell to 2.2% in October from 2.7% the month before. The surprise fall saw CPI inflation drop to its lowest rate for more than a year, and eases pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates. The figure was below forecasts of 2.5% and is the lowest since September 2012. The Office for National Statistics said the fall was driven by the biggest drop in transport prices since July 2009. It said transport prices fell by 1.5% between September and October. One major transport cost factor came from fuel price cuts at many major supermarket chains engaged in a price war. There were also downwards price movements on some air fares. Another inflation fall came in education costs, with the impact of rising tuition fees being smaller than at the same time a year previously. And food inflation fell too, from 4.8% to 4.3%. "Falling petrol and diesel prices seem to have done the most to drag the inflation rate down, and the ongoing softness in Brent crude prices means there may be a little more of this to come in the months ahead," said economist Rob Carnell at ING. "There was also some price softness in furniture and household items too." A separate measure of inflation, the retail prices index (RPI), fell from 3.2% in September to 2.6% in October. The drop in the inflation rate means the Bank of England is considerably closer to its inflation target of 2%, which it has exceeded since December 2009. However, recently announced price rises by most of the UK's large energy firms have yet to take effect and will have an inflationary impact in the coming months. The Bank will publish its latest inflation forecast on Wednesday. "The Bank of England's forward guidance states that a hike in interest will not be considered until unemployment drops below 7%," said economist Chris Williamson at Markit. He said the Bank's forecast was likely to "bring forward when the Bank expects this to happen from late 2016 to perhaps late 2015, given the recent flow of stronger than expected economic data". </body>

      <body>House prices across the UK have dropped back slightly, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Last month, the ONS reported that prices were at their highest since records began in 1968. However, in a surprise development, its house price index fell from 186 in October to 184.9 in November. Once the figures have been adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, prices showed no change between the months of August and September. But over the year as a whole, house prices continued to increase. Annual inflation rose from 3.7% in August to 3.8% in September. Despite the monthly pause in prices, economists said the long-term trend was still upwards. "Flat house prices in September reported by the Office for National Statistics will likely do little to ease concerns that we could be headed for a new housing market bubble," said Howard Archer, the chief UK economist of IHS Global Insight. The ONS house price index, which is based on mortgage completions, gives a heavy weighting towards prices in London. Across the UK regions, prices rose by 4.2% in England and 1.4% in Wales. However, prices fell by 1.1% in Scotland, and 1.5% in Northern Ireland. Earlier, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) called for urgent action to cope with the soaring demand for houses. It said that demand was not being matched by supply. And it warned that a lack of houses being put up for sale was proving problematic. "The amount of homes currently up for sale is still nowhere near enough to keep up with demand," said Simon Rubinsohn, the chief economist of Rics. "In order for the market to function correctly, this imbalance urgently needs to be addressed." he said. Its regular monthly survey showed that more surveyors were reporting house price rises than at any time in the last 11 years. By contrast, demand for rented accommodation had also fallen to its lowest for a decade. </body>

      <body>UK Financial Investments, the Treasury unit that manages the government's stakes in RBS and Lloyds, says it softened government plans for sharp cuts in bonuses at both banks. Robin Budenberg, chairman of UKFI, told MPs that Chancellor George Osborne had proposed reductions that exceeded what was "commercially acceptable". As a result, UKFI had limited the extent of the cuts, he said. Mr Budenberg was speaking during a Treasury Select Committee meeting. The government owns 81% of Royal Bank of Scotland and almost 33% of Lloyds. UKFI was set up after RBS and Lloyds were bailed out with £66bn ($101bn) of taxpayers' money during the 2008 financial crisis. The committee meeting asked if UKFI was at "arm's length" from the government and made its decisions on commercial grounds. Mr Budenberg said: "I believe we make sure that banks are able to run in the best interests of their shareholders." He also told lawmakers that issues concerning sufficient capital and strategic focus needed to be resolved before RBS could be privatised. Mr Budenberg said the privatisation could be accelerated as a result of restructuring measures, but that it was too early to say when RBS shares could be sold. </body>

      <description>American Airlines and US Airways settle an anti-trust suit, paving the way for a merger which would create the world's biggest airline.</description>

      <body>American Airlines and US Airways have settled an anti-trust suit with US regulators, paving the way for their proposed merger to be finalised. The merger would create the world's largest airline. As part of the agreement, which must still be approved by a judge, the airlines will give up slots at several US airports. The two companies argued the consolidation was necessary to their survival. The US Justice Department had sued to stop the $11bn (£6.9bn) merger in August, arguing it would reduce competition and result in higher prices for consumers. "This agreement has the potential to shift the landscape of the airline industry...[and] ensures airline passengers will see more competition on nonstop and connecting routes throughout the country," said Attorney General Eric Holder in a statement. The two airlines will each give up 57 slots to low-cost carrier airlines at Ronald Reagan International Airport in Washington DC and 34 slots at LaGuardia Airport (LGA) in New York City. The companies say this will result in 44 fewer daily departures at Reagan and 12 fewer daily departures at LGA - a fraction of the close to 400 daily flights that the airlines operate from those two airports. "They dominated Reagan Airport, that's why they had the Department of Justice concerned," Ray Neidl, an airline analyst at Nexa Capital, told the BBC, who said that giving up slots at the airport was an unsurprising part of the agreement. "It was better than litigating," he added. An additional two slots each at Boston Logan International, Chicago O'Hare International, Dallas Love Field, Los Angeles International and Miami International airports will be released. The slots will be given to low cost airlines like JetBlue and Southwest. "This agreement allows us to take the final steps in creating the new American Airlines," said Tom Horton, head of American Airline's parent corporation, AMR, in a statement. The company now says it expects the merger to be finalised in December 2013. AMR Corp has been in a bankruptcy restructuring for two years and it is hoped that once the merger is finalised, the company will be able to complete its turnaround. Shares in US Airways traded 3.5% higher before being halted on pending news. They were lower once the specifics of the deal had been announced. The anti-trust trial had been scheduled to start later this month. The US Justice Department had been joined by the attorneys-general of Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Tennessee, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, but all have agreed to the proposed settlement. </body>

      <body>Vodafone has reported a half-year pre-tax profit of £1.5bn ($2.4bn) as it said trading in Europe remained "very tough at present". Chief executive Vittorio Colao said he had seen "intense macroeconomic, regulatory and competitive pressures during the period" there. But he was "encouraged" by forecasts that Europe would return to growth. Mr Colao said the emerging markets businesses were doing well thanks to the smartphone. He said he hoped for a shift in regulation to support industry investment and consolidation. Mr Colao said mature markets were "challenging", but that focusing on cost efficiency was helping. The figure marks a big fall from its £3.9bn half-year pre-tax profit in 2012. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said the fall in profits was mainly due to Vodafone's difficulties in Europe. He said there were some "issues under the bonnet", such as regulatory concerns and Vodafone's performance in India, as well as the "famously" competitive mobile phone industry. But he added: "Nonetheless, the outlook over the horizon is bright." Vodafone's results came at the same time as fellow UK telecoms firm TalkTalk revealed a £9m pre-tax loss for the six months to the end of September. The drop compared with a £46m profit for the same period last year. Despite the swing into loss, shares in TalkTalk rose over 10%, buoyed by the company's higher forecast for revenue growth. It said this would be at least 3%, up from 2% for the full financial year. TalkTalk, which offers broadband, fixed line and mobile telecoms and TV services, said the pre-tax loss reflected the investments it had made, mainly in its TV service, during the period. The firm said it had signed up 167,000 new customers for its TV service in the three months to the end of September, putting it on track to have nearly a million viewers by the end of next year. "We are delighted with the progress we have made in the first half," said Dido Harding, TalkTalk chief executive. Meanwhile, Vodafone, the world's second-largest mobile operator said it plans to spend £7bn on improving its networks by March 2016. The move follows Vodafone's deal in September to sell its US business to Verizon Communications for $130bn. The US arm made up 45% of Vodafone's business, and the deal marked one of the largest to date in corporate history. As part of its growth plan, "Project Spring", the introduction of 4G networks, will be accelerated and investment for laying fibre optic cables increased, to allow Vodafone to offer faster broadband to its customers. </body>

      <body>Chartered surveyors have called for urgent action to cope with "soaring demand" from house buyers. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics), also indicated that not enough houses are coming on to the market. Rics said that "rocketing interest" from potential buyers was "dwarfing" the number of properties for sale. In the meantime, official figures out later are expected to show UK house prices hitting another record high. The comments from Rics accompanied the results of its latest monthly survey of its members. It measured the opinion of 300 chartered surveyors across the country. In October those reporting price rises outnumbered those reporting no rises by the highest margin since 2002. The government's Help to Buy scheme is one reason for that, said Rics. But it warned that a lack of houses being put up for sale is proving problematic. "The amount of homes currently up for sale is still nowhere near enough to keep up with demand," said Simon Rubinsohn, the chief economist of Rics. "In order for the market to function correctly, this imbalance urgently needs to be addressed." he said. By contrast, the survey shows declining interest from people wanting to rent accommodation. The proportion of surveyors reporting a rise in interest from potential tenants was at its lowest for a decade. Figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) out later are expected to show UK house prices at a new record high. Last month the ONS reported that prices across the country are higher than at any time since the survey began in 1968. It said prices were rising in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but were falling in Scotland. However, the Land Registry has reported that the average house price in England and Wales is £167,063, which is still 8% below its peak in November 2007. </body>

      <title>Bookshops lash out at Amazon offer</title>
      <description>An initiative by Amazon to sell Kindle readers in independent bookshops is met with hostility among shop owners.</description>

      <body>Bookshop owners have hit back at an initiative by Amazon to sell its Kindle e-book reader in independent shops. The Amazon Source programme, launching first in the US, would let bookshops sell the devices and receive a small cut of e-book sales thereafter. But reaction has been hostile - one US bookseller described it as "inviting hungry foxes into the henhouse". Amazon said bookshops "should be striving to offer customers what they want". Announcing the initiative earlier this week the company said: "With Amazon Source, customers don't have to choose between e-books and their favourite neighbourhood bookstore - they can have both." However, it appeared bookshop owners were not convinced. New York-based publisher Melville House gathered opinions, and posted the frosty responses on its website. "Hmmm, let's see," wrote Carole Horne from Harvard Book Store in Massachusetts. "We sell Kindles for essentially no profit, the new Kindle customer is in our store where they can browse and discover books, the new Kindle customer can then check the price on Amazon and order the e-book. "We make a little on their e-book purchases, but then lose them as a customer completely after two years. Doesn't sound like such a great partnership to me." Staff at Skylight Books in California said it was "a Trojan Horse-style attempt to gain access to our customers". Amazon has not yet announced whether it has plans to extend the scheme to the UK. However, retailer Waterstones began selling the Kindle device in its stores earlier this year, despite managing director James Daunt previously describing Amazon as a "ruthless, money-making devil". Mr Daunt admitted that readers were migrating to digital platforms, but that it was beyond the company's capabilities to develop and manufacture its own device. But whether independent bookshops will welcome the same logic is as yet unclear. The resentment stateside was welcomed by Patrick Neale, president of the Booksellers Association and co-owner of Jaffe and Neale bookshop and cafe in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. "I was really pleased to see that American independent bookshops were saying no thanks," he told the BBC. "We've stopped and thought about it because we're business people. But you've got to draw a line in the sand somewhere - they are destroying the high street. "To do anything in collaboration would be wrong to our customers - it would be a very confusing message." He added that a more favourable e-book deal for bookshops would be directly with publishers, with various discussions of that nature currently taking place. Mr Neale's view was shared by Fran Crumpton, company manager at the Book Partnership, a group that helps independent bookshops set up online operations. She too believed most bookshops would be opposed to the deal. "Why should they be selling Amazon's products? That will then stop people using their bookshops - and we are losing so many. That's what many bookshops are thinking." Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <title>Tesco to use face-scan ad targeting</title>
      <description>Tesco is installing face-scanning technology at its petrol stations to target adverts at different types of customers.</description>

      <body>Tesco is installing face-scanning technology at its petrol stations to target advertisements to individual customers at the till. The technology, made by Lord Sugar's digital signage company Amscreen, will use a camera to identify a customer's gender and approximate age. It will then show an advertisement tailored to that demographic. Tesco says the screens will be rolled out across all 450 of its forecourts in the UK. "It's like something out of Minority Report," said Amscreen's chief executive Simon Sugar, Lord Sugar's eldest son. "But this could change the face of British retail, and our plans are to expand the screens into as many supermarkets as possible." A Tesco spokeswoman said: "This is not new technology." "No data or images are collected or stored and the system does not use eyeball scanners or facial-recognition technology", she added. The length of someone's hair could be used to work out their gender, she said. Privacy campaigners said companies had to tell their customers they were using the technology. Nick Pickles, of Big Brother Watch, said: "If people were told that every time they walked into a supermarket, or a doctor's surgery or a law firm, that the CCTV camera in the corner is trying to find out who they are, I think that will have a huge impact on what buildings people go into." Systems could only be "ethically deployed" if customers agreed to opt in to having their behaviour tracked, he added. Philip James, joint head of technology at Pitmans law firm, argues that this technology is similar to the way social media sites tailor adverts to users based on the content of their profiles. "The capture of facial signatures represents a potentially much greater infringement of customers' privacy in the absence of prior consent," he said. The screens are expected to reach five million customers. </body>

      <title>Davey: Energy users 'not cash cows'</title>
      <description>Gas and electricity customers should not be "cash cows" to be "squeezed" to create bigger profits for shareholders, Energy Secretary Ed Davey says.</description>

      <body>Gas and electricity customers are "not just cash cows" to be "squeezed" to create bigger profits for shareholders, Energy Secretary Ed Davey has said. In a speech, the Liberal Democrat minister called on the industry to "open up your books" to show how it was trying to minimise tariffs. Millions of customers face price rises for gas and electricity this winter. But industry body Energy UK complained that a "tit-for-tat Punch and Judy show of insults" was developing. Five of the UK's six main energy companies have recently announced price rises, with an average increase of 8.1%. EDF Energy was the latest provider to raise bills, by an average of 3.9%. The firms say the rises are largely due to increasing wholesale prices, but critics say they are unfair and will lead households into difficulties with bills. In September, Labour leader Ed Miliband announced plans for a 20-month energy price freeze from May 2015, should his party win the next election. He has accused the coalition of doing too little to help keep tariffs down. But the government has launched a competition review and will review green and social charges, responsible for some of the cost of bills. In his speech to the annual conference of Energy UK, which represents the industry, in London on Tuesday, Mr Davey argued that companies need to make enough money to invest in greener technologies. He added: "But those profits cannot come at the expense of the elderly, the vulnerable, and the poorest in our society. Customers are not just cash cows to be squeezed in the pursuit of a higher return for shareholders. "Trust between those who supply energy and those who use it is breaking down. "It is so difficult for people to work out what exactly they are paying for that they fear the big energy companies are taking them for a ride when bills go up." Mr Davey said: "Fair or not, they look at the big suppliers and they see a reflection of the greed that consumed the banks." He told companies: "You deliver an essential public service, so your industry must serve the public - and the public must have trust in what you do." Mr Davey said the government was looking at how to reduce the impact of its policies on bills, adding: "But our commitment must be matched by a commitment in industry to open up your books and set out exactly how you are bearing down on your own costs to make bills as low as possible." He also told industry leaders they faced a "Fred the Shred" moment, in reference to the former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin, who was stripped of his knighthood after leading the bank to near-collapse in 2008. But Labour's shadow energy secretary, Caroline Flint, said: "David Cameron's out-of-touch government is offering nothing to the millions of families faced with rising energy bills and a cost-of-living crisis." "Ed Davey and the Lib Dems had a chance to support Labour's energy bill freeze but have chosen instead to side with the Tories and the energy companies. "It just goes to show you can't trust a word they say." Energy UK said the industry was "already working hard to ensure everyone can keep the lights on and stay warm this winter". "The best way to do this is for everyone to work together, which is why this tit-for-tat Punch and Judy show of insults is so unproductive," a spokesman said. "The energy industry is vital to the UK. It is a major employer, a serious investor and a significant taxpayer. "As analysis from UBS shows, about 95% of rising energy costs are out of the hands of the energy companies and can be attributed to government policies and other network, social and environmental costs." Meanwhile, a former adviser to Tony Blair has criticised Mr Miliband's decision to focus on the cost of living, describing it as "the stupidest campaign any opposition can start, ever". John McTernan, who served as Mr Blair's political secretary at Downing Street, told a discussion organised by centre-left think tank the Policy Network that most bills squeezing household budgets are "irresolvable grievances" beyond the control of politicians. "If you raise cost of living, be prepared to deal with housing costs," he said. "If not, just shut up." </body>

      <title>'Strong start' for Help to Buy</title>
      <description>Royal Bank of Scotland and Halifax report a strong uptake in the first month of the government's extended Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme.</description>

      <body>Two major lenders have reported a strong uptake in the first month of the government's extended Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Halifax said they had received a total of 2,384 applications, potentially worth £365m in mortgages. The scheme is designed to encourage lenders to offer mortgages with deposits as low as 5%. But critics are concerned it could help to create a UK housing bubble. RBS and its subsidiary NatWest, and Halifax - owned by Lloyds Banking Group - are among the few lenders to offer mortgages under the government's extended scheme. HSBC and Barclays are planning to offer such mortgages in the future, but Nationwide, the UK's second largest lender, has not yet made a decision. The first phase of Help to Buy was launched in April, but only provided help to first-time buyers buying new-build homes. The extended scheme applies to all buyers and all types of homes, up to a value of £600,000. Under this part of the scheme, up to 15% of the value of the loan will be guaranteed by the Treasury. RBS said it had so-far approved 169 of its 1,075 applications, and five customers had already completed their purchases. It said the majority of applications had come from young couples with a joint salary of less than £50,000. The average price of the property being bought was £167,565. Unlike the first part of the Help to Buy Scheme, part two also offers help to existing home owners. However, Halifax said more than 80% of the applications it had received under the scheme were from first-time buyers, while RBS/NatWest said it was 73%. RBS said the majority of applications had come from outside London and the south-east of England, where property prices are rising fastest. It also said that five purchases had so far been completed. The government welcomed the figures, saying the scheme was supporting "responsible lending", helping borrowers who could afford mortgage repayments, but not a large deposit. "Four weeks in and its clear that Help to Buy is already delivering," said Prime Minister David Cameron. "Most Help to Buy applicants are first-time buyers, young and have a roughly average household income. This is all about helping hardworking people get on the first rung of the property ladder." But critics have expressed concern that the scheme could create a bubble in the housing market, making home affordability an even bigger problem. Chris Leslie, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: "If the government was serious about helping first-time buyers they would also be bringing forward investment to build more affordable homes. "Rising demand for housing must be matched with rising supply, but under this government house building is at its lowest level since the 1920s," he said. Labour says that the Bank of England should review the scheme immediately, rather than waiting for a year. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest average house prices in the UK are at a record level. Other measures suggest house prices and housing transactions are well short of the pre-crisis peak. Figures from Halifax suggest house prices are well below what they were in 2007, but have risen steadily for the last nine consecutive months. The Nationwide Building Society says prices are currently 5.8% higher than a year ago. But estate agents argue that much of those price rises are seen in London and the south-east of England, while prices in other parts of the country are rising more slowly, or in some cases actually falling. The housebuilder Redrow reported that 35% of its sales since June have been under the first part of the government's Help to Buy scheme. </body>

      <title>31% pay 'unaffordable' housing costs</title>
      <description>Thirty one per cent of people paying a mortgage or rent spend more than a third of their disposable income each month doing so, a survey for BBC Panorama suggests.</description>

      <body>Thirty one per cent of people paying a mortgage or rent spend more than a third of their disposable income each month doing so, a survey for BBC Panorama suggests. Housing charity Shelter said that makes mortgage or rent costs "unaffordable". It said family budgets are being put under "enormous pressure" because of a "shortage of affordable homes". The survey of 1,003 people also suggests 46% of people think property prices are too high in their area. According to Shelter and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, spending more than a third of your disposable income on rent or a mortgage means you may not be able to afford other basic needs. 'Impossible choices' Shelter chief executive Campbell Robb said: "The widely accepted test of affordability is that housing costs should take up no more than a third of your income." "But in reality, many families don't have any option but to pay out much more," he said. "This sees some faced with impossible choices every day - including between putting enough food on the table or paying for the roof over their head." Among those affected by rising property prices is Abi Reilly, a 33-year-old special needs school teacher. She lives in a terraced house in Reading with her husband, Chris, and two children, five-year-old Daniel and four-month-old Elsie. They spend around 40% of their disposable income on rent. Having rented 13 different properties over the past 10 years, Mrs Reilly said homeownership does not feel realistic. "It feels too far away," she said. "How can we save for a deposit when our rents are going up, energy's going up, everything's going up, wages stay the same, house prices go up? Mathematically it doesn't work." The Ipsos MORI survey commissioned by Panorama questioned a total of 1,003 adults - of whom 697 pay a mortgage or renting a property. Mrs Reilly would belong to the 31% of people in this latter group who pay more than a third of their disposable income on their mortgage or rent. The survey also suggested that 46% of people think property prices are too high in their area and 39% would like to see property prices fall. In August, the Office for National Statistics said the average price of a property had reached a record high of £247,000. ONS figures also show that home ownership peaked at 69% of households 12 years ago. Since then it has been falling and is now at 64%. Panorama has also looked at the Help to Buy scheme set up by the government in April to assist people who could afford mortgage repayments but were struggling to raise a deposit. It allows buyers of new-build homes to put down a 5% deposit and take out a government loan for up to 20% of the value of the property. Help to Buy was extended to existing homes in October, under which the government partially guarantees mortgages. Since it began, there has been a 6% rise in the number of new homes being built. Merryn Somerset Webb, editor-in-chief of MoneyWeek magazine, said Help to Buy risks inflating prices and overheating the housing market. "It's like pouring petrol over the car and setting fire to the whole thing," she said. "You know you might get a little heat in the short-term but the end result is not actually what you wanted." But the government has dismissed concerns about a property price bubble. Housing Minister Kris Hopkins said: "In Yorkshire, the North East and Scotland, house prices have moved very little or in some cases have actually gone backwards." "And that's reflecting where wages are and what money people have actually got to spend. " He also told Panorama: "We've seen nothing yet to suggest there is anything, going anywhere near a bubble at this moment in time."

      <title>EU clinches deal on 2014 budget</title>
      <description>Negotiators in Brussels clinch a deal on the 2014 EU budget after gruelling talks, with spending cut by about 6% compared to 2013.</description>

      <body>Negotiators in Brussels have clinched a deal on the 2014 EU budget after a night of hard talks, cutting spending by about 6% compared to 2013. Spending will total 135.5bn euros (£113.3; $181.3bn), or 0.5bn less than the Commission sought and 0.9bn short of the European Parliament's target. However, the budget is 0.5bn euros bigger than what austerity-conscious government leaders were demanding. It reflects stricter new terms agreed by EU leaders in February. There will be greater funding for economic growth, jobs, innovation and humanitarian aid, Lithuania's Deputy Finance Minister Algimantas Rimkunas said in a statement. His country currently holds the six-month rotating EU presidency. EU agencies dealing with migration, asylum and border control will also be strengthened, as will the European financial supervisory authorities, he added. About two-thirds of the budget will go on subsidies for farmers and on development projects in the EU's poorer regions, as in previous years. But the spending on such projects - called the "cohesion" budget - is being cut by about 7bn euros. Four governments voted against the compromise deal - the UK, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden, German ARD television reported. They wanted the EU to make deeper cuts. The Economic Secretary to the UK Treasury, Nicky Morgan, said the deal showed that Prime Minister David Cameron's influence was "genuinely bearing down on EU spending". "However, the final budget wasn't low enough to gain UK backing. When governments and families across Europe are taking difficult decisions to make savings, it would be wrong and irresponsible for the EU to not show similar restraint," he said. The deal was reached early on Tuesday after 16 hours of negotiation, and still requires final approval from the parliament and EU ministers next week. The UK Conservative leader in Europe, Richard Ashworth MEP, welcomed "what is an effective freeze of the EU budget - headline spend is still set to fall by 6%". He said that "alongside the historic 3.8% reduction which we have secured on the EU's long-term budget, this is further evidence of us bringing genuine discipline to EU spending". "It is particularly welcome that money has been switched away from less-useful budget headings to the important areas of research and development, education, training and jobs," he added. He called the budget "a step in the right direction". For the UK Liberal Democrats, George Lyon MEP said the budget deal boosted research and development funding by 200m euros compared to the original Commission proposal. "That means more money for UK universities, who currently receive more EU research funding than any other country," he said. There remains some opposition to the deal in the European Parliament, however. Helga Truepel MEP of the Greens said it was "a bad deal that will continue the perpetual cycle of EU under-budgeting". "With the budget to be reduced 6% compared with 2013, the outcome is not only devoid of ambition, it will also lead to a situation again next year where the EU is facing budget shortfalls compared with programmed spending." The deal, once signed off, should pave the way for the European Parliament to adopt the EU's long-term trillion-euro budget for 2014-2020. At the same time, the negotiators in Brussels agreed to allocate an extra 3.9bn euros to pay outstanding bills for 2013 incurred in cohesion projects. An additional 400.5m euros will also be spent from the EU "solidarity" fund to help areas of Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria and Romania which were hit by flooding this year. </body>

      <body>The EU and US have begun a second round of negotiations towards creating the world's biggest free-trade deal. Talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) had been set for October, but were postponed because of the US government shutdown. Relations have become strained after claims that the US listened to German leader Angela Merkel's mobile calls. US Secretary of State John Kerry last week urged European leaders not to allow the row to disrupt the talks. Together the US and EU account for about $30 trillion (£18.7tn) of annual output - almost half the world's total. The EU says a deal could bring annual benefits of 119bn euros ($159bn; £99bn) for its 28 member states. It is hoped that an agreement could be reached by the end of 2014. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that it would be "very good news for economic growth in years to come". Mr Schmieding said one area where agreed standards could help bring down costs was in the automotive trade, if the US and Europe could decide on agreed standards for cars. However, he says that potential stumbling blocks include the areas of personal data protection and GM foods. Others have said a deal could weaken existing strong consumer laws on both sides of the Atlantic. A third round of talks is scheduled for 16-20 December in Washington. This week's talks cover services, investment, energy and raw materials. EU negotiator Ignacio Garcia Bercero and US counterpart Dan Mullaney will give an update on talks later this week. </body>

      <title>PM to lead trade delegation to China</title>
      <description>Prime Minister David Cameron will lead a trade delegation to China next month, he tells an audience in the City of London.</description>

      <body>David Cameron is to lead a delegation of ministers and business figures to China next month, he has announced. The move represents a warming of relations after a dispute over the PM's decision to meet the Dalai Lama in May. And it comes a month after the chancellor, George Osborne, fronted a business delegation to China. Mr Osborne's Autumn Statement, which sets out the UK government's tax and spending proposals, has been put back 24 hours to accommodate the trip. It will now take place on 5 December, the Treasury said. The prime minister announced the trade visit during his annual speech to the Guildhall in the City of London where he also announced increased UK aid to the typhoon-hit Philippines. Mr Cameron, who has visited China once since he entered Number 10, said the delegation would depart in early December. "I will take senior British ministers - as well as business leaders from every sector, large and small - to forge a relationship that will benefit both our countries and bring real rewards for our peoples," he said. The trip would help British companies tap into China's "vast and varied markets" he said, adding: "This is a relationship that is for the long term, that matters for Britain and China, and which I look forward to continuing to strengthen in the months and years to come." Earlier this year it was reported the prime minister had been barred from the country by Chinese officials. They reacted angrily when Mr Cameron met with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader. At the time, the PM's spokesman said he planned to visit the country later in the year. The December trip would be the UK government's second attempt in as many months to improve economic links with China. In October the chancellor announced a relaxation of visa restrictions for Chinese visitors and moves to allow Chinese companies to invest in British nuclear power stations. Giving his annual address to the Lord Mayor's banquet, the PM also said he wanted to encourage more investors from the Gulf with a new electronic visa waiver system for short-term visitors. He added that the "global economy" was not a "zero sum game". "As the number of university places surges in India, as China creates more patents than any other country in the world, and as Brazil becomes the world's first sustainable biofuels economy, people ask the question, 'will they be the winners and we be the losers?' I believe we need to say a very firm 'No',". </body>

      <title>Amateur film-maker turned media boss</title>
      <description>How Londoner Jamal Edwards went from teenage amateur film-maker to 23-year-old multimillionaire.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24801980</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70992000/jpg/_70992386_jamal1.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>From a teenager on a council estate in west London to self-made multimillionaire, Jamal Edwards hasn't done too badly for himself in a very short space of time. Still just 23 years old, the amateur film-maker turned media boss is worth more than £8m, and counts famous entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson as one of his friends. Jamal is the owner of SBTV, a broadcasting company that makes videos - typically music videos featuring rap and pop music stars - and puts them up on YouTube. Attracting millions of hits, the business continues to make a fortune by taking a percentage of YouTube's advertising revenues for adverts that are linked to its videos. It is not a bad living for a young man who got into film-making after his parents gave him a basic video camera as a Christmas present when he was 15, and someone who by his own admission has no formal training. Jamal says it is just a question of believing in yourself, and finding your talent, which for him is making videos. "Try anything, don't be scared of failure, that is my advice," he says. "The only failure is not trying. And when you find your niche, what you are really good at, hit it so hard." Back when Jamal was 15, he says he and his video camera immediately became inseparable, and he started to film friends rapping or singing. Not instantly aware of the commercial potential of what he was doing, Jamal says he started to upload the videos to YouTube simply to make it easier for his extended friends to see them. "You can say my videos had mixed reviews to begin with, some people didn't get them, but others thought they were sick [good]," he says. "So I started to put them up on YouTube so everyone could see them, and it just grew from there." Leaving school and getting a job in clothing company Topman, Jamal continued to make videos avidly in his spare time. Building up a reputation for the quality of his work, he would film up-and-coming rappers and singers, while also targeting more established stars outside nightclubs, hotels and dance music radio station Kiss 100. As word of mouth spread, his videos on YouTube, put up under the name SBTV (the SB stands for SmokeyBarz, Jamal's own rapping nickname) started to get hundreds of thousands of hits, predominantly from 13- to 30-year-olds. And so Jamal contacted YouTube to see if he was eligible for a share of advertising revenues. YouTube, owned by internet search engine giant, Google, turned him down three times, but Jamal persisted. YouTube ultimately agreed after he was able to prove that all the videos he was uploading were original content that he had made himself. "My first YouTube cheque was for a couple of hundred pounds. So I said, 'Look mum, I have earned money from YouTube.' "But my parents were like, 'That's not sustainable income, that's not steady.' But the cheques have just got bigger and bigger. The more effort I put in, the more views the videos get, and the more advertising revenues I get back." Soon Jamal was able to quit Topman and run SBTV on a full-time basis. Today he has 12 members of staff, and SBTV also has its own website that carries news stories and feature articles in addition to the videos. The business has further branched out into its own clothing line, as Jamal says he is always thinking of ways to expand. And while the grime dance music scene remains a core focus, SBTV has also moved into other musical genres. An SBTV video of singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran has had 7.7 million hits on YouTube. Jamal says he is now set on conquering the US, and further expanding the video content to cover comedy, sport and fashion. Regarding his interest in the latter, he was seen in the front row at September's London Fashion Week. Jamal has also this year published a self-help e-book called Self Belief: The Vision. The business so impressed Sir Richard Branson that last year Jamal won a best new start-up award from Virgin Media. And the two have stayed in touch ever since. Others who have seen SBTV's potential include technology and music investment specialists Miroma Ventures, which last month bought a share in the business for an undisclosed sum. Jamal was also chosen to become an ambassador for the Prince's Trust, the youth charity run by Prince Charles which supports young people setting up their own companies. After such meteoric growth, Jamal says he often has to remind himself to slow down. "I still get bad anxiety at times, if I have too many things going on. I have to sit down and tell myself to take a breather," he says. "I think this is one of the most important things for any entrepreneur to remember - that you can't go 100% all of the time. "I have crashed and burned about three times over the years because I was just working, working, working. Now I'm more planned, more organised." But has becoming a multimillionaire changed him? "Honestly no, I come from a humble background, I'm from a council estate. It is nice to be comfortable, and be able to buy things for friends and family, but I'm not motivated by the money. "I don't want to be treated any different, I'm still the same person, I'm well grounded. And if I wasn't, my friends and family would soon knock me down to size." </body>

They dream of creating a huge enterprise - with them at the top. Others see starting a company as simply a means to meet a particular need, and may find the business aspects boring and onerous. There's another set of company founders who not only love the challenge of solving problems, but also love the actual process of creating start-ups. The Californian serial entrepreneur Judy Estrin probably falls into the latter group. "I guess I'm addicted to the excitement of building teams," she says. Ms Estrin has been involved in the founding of eight businesses so far. She also has extensive experience of being at the top of some huge enterprises, through serving on the boards of companies such as Walt Disney, FedEx and Sun Microsystems. Ms Estrin says that, while she greatly enjoys and values her work with big companies, what excites her most is working in a smaller environment. "The best innovation happens when you have teams that are no bigger than a jazz band," she says. She says she did try to break her addiction to start-ups for a while - but what drew her back in was when her son got involved in launching a company. That business is Evntlive, a firm that streams live and on-demand concerts and events over the internet. The company has featured artists such as Bon Jovi, Moby, Wale and events such as the Mountain Jam festival. Pay-per-view costs typically range from around $3 to $11 (£2-£7), and vary depending on whether the concert is live or recorded. The enterprise seems to have entered a crowded marketplace, competing with many other streaming services from companies such as Netflix, and cable and satellite TV. However Ms Estrin believes that Evntlive can gain an edge over competitors by offering lots of extra features, such as additional content and integration with social media, allowing fans to communicate easily with each other during events. "We have what we call a 'buzz' feature, which is commenting and so everybody who's watching the concert can be commenting," she says. Ms Estrin studied at the University of California, Los Angeles, and subsequently at Stanford University, where she worked with Vint Cerf, one of the pioneers of the internet. Despite having offers to work at several big firms, she joined a small new company called Zilog, because "a friend of my father's said that the smartest people he knew were at that company". Zilog was involved in making silicon chips. Ms Estrin says she found it both exciting and enlightening working at a technology start-up. Something she found particularly valuable was being included in the customer feedback loop, something that could happen only because the firm was still small. "In a big company, the engineers are very separated from the problems of the customer," she says. Bitten by the start-up bug, Ms Estrin left Zilog in order to launch companies of her own. Together with her then husband Bill Carrico, she founded Bridge Communications, which was an early pioneer of computer networking devices. She went on to launch a string of other businesses. One of these, Precept Software, was acquired by technology giant Cisco. Ms Estrin joined Cisco, and spent two years with the firm as chief technology officer. But not all of her ventures proved to be successful - one company eventually had to be closed down. Ms Estrin says it was an "awful" experience, not so much because of the notion of failing, but because "this group of people were going to not have jobs the next day". Nevertheless, she says that failure is "an inherent part of entrepreneurship". It's difficult to learn and improve if you don't take some risks. Something she points out in her book Closing the Innovation Gap, is that not enough attention to the different levels of success. "You can be a mid-level success and you can still be having a lot of fun solving a lot of good problems, making money for your investors. Not every company is a Google or a Facebook," she says. After taking some time out to work on her book, Ms Estrin found herself drawn back in to the start-up world by her son, David Carrico, when he and his co-founders were setting up Evntlive. Mr Carrico says he's heard "horror stories" about involving family members in businesses. But he felt he needed to do what was best for the company, "and I didn't know of a better entrepreneur in my network that I could enable to be a partner in this". Ms Estrin provided initial funding herself, and after acting as an adviser and mentor, she formally joined the team as chief executive. She says the worst thing about working with her son is: "He calls me Judy instead of Mom… everything else is great." </body>

      <title>Should women improve networking skills?</title>
      <description>Is it true that men are better at networking than women? Jane O'Brien speaks to a number of US business women to see how they network.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24801975</url>

      <body>There is a widely held belief that women are generally better than men at developing and maintaining relationships. But many women seem unable to transfer those skills to the business world, where the same activity is commonly called "networking". "Part of the cause is that women value authenticity in relationships," says Deborah Gillis, chief operating officer for Catalyst, a women's business research and advocacy group. "Sometimes the notion of meeting someone and then looking to them for help, or advice, or contacts in business, often feels just a little uncomfortable. Men seem to do it much more naturally." Experts have various explanations as to why this might be, but they are agreed on one important point - informal networks are critical to success, and more women need to learn how to benefit from them. "Women need to think about networking as a business skill," says Ms Gillis. "And just as we would focus our attention on developing other skills that are important to our success, we should spend time and care in building our confidence and ability to network effectively." But becoming a part of informal groups - especially those dominated by men - can be difficult, as technology blogger and consultant Vanessa Fox discovered when she left Google to start her own company in Seattle. As one of the industry's few female experts on search engine optimisation, she had to overcome both professional and social barriers - and that meant learning how to play poker. "I would go to these poker games, and I was always the only woman there," she says. "It's not that the men exclude women - they actually invited me - it's that women either don't know about [these activities], or they're intimidated. "I think they have this idea that men can automatically play poker. But actually men can't play poker either, and a lot of women I know are really good at math - more so than the guys." But the game itself isn't as important as the conversations that naturally develop, she says. "They tell you what their start-up does and what they're doing, and so you get to know people. And because of my experience, a lot of these guys then want to meet up with me because they want my advice - and that's when you start to build relationships outside of the more formal events." Ms Fox is the first to point out that such an approach isn't for everybody, but adds that she had little choice. "I've had to join men's networks because that's what was out there," she says. "The tech start-up world happens to be mostly men, and it happens that they want to play poker. "They're not actively saying they're going to try to find a thing that women don't like - they just want to have a good time." Sport has also become a popular networking tool for women. "If you can speak sport, talk sport, in an authoritative way where you actually watch it, and follow the game and you're passionate about it, it allows you to be one of the gang and gets you into the circle you can't get into any other way," says Susan Spencer, a former manager at American football team Philadelphia Eagles. She says sport offers a "safe" subject for women to talk about with their male counterparts. Ms Spencer adds: "If you go out for drinks you don't want to talk about politics, that's a deadly one, you're not going to do boy talk with a load of sexual innuendoes because that takes you down a road you don't want to go - it has to be sport!" Jenn Harris has taken the idea a stage further with the launch last year of High-heel Golfer. Based in San Diego, she travels all over the country offering workshops to women who want to use the game to develop better business relationships. "I don't think of the golf course as a man's world. I think of it as a place to learn about someone else," she says. "All the little things that happen are ways to see who that person really is - how do they react after a shot, do they cheat, do they have integrity? You can't get that over drinks at a happy hour." A keen golfer since the age of seven, Ms Harris cites her own experience as proof of the power of golf. While working for a defence contractor she needed to get to know military commanders and other executives who all enjoyed playing. She joined them on the golf course, and attributes her subsequent success to the contacts she made. "I was promoted within nine months, was put on every big project over the next two years, and later, when budget cuts were made, the clients made it known that I shouldn't be fired - all because of that relationship I developed on the golf course," says Ms Harris. But employment expert Jean Martin says that unless women actually enjoy playing golf, the game is unlikely to be much use as a networking tool. "The number one element of a successful informal relationship is that the individuals are true to themselves. So doing something that you're not interested in just to be with people ultimately creates an artificial founding of the relationship," she says. Ms Martin is executive director of human resources at CEB, a global business advisory company with headquarters in Washington DC. She says research has demonstrated that effective networking can increase business performance by 30%. As a result, companies themselves are looking at ways to increase networking opportunities for women that highlights their different interests. "Rather than everyone trying to be the same, all on the golf course together, our data suggests that companies which have a lot of people with a lot of different interests and perspectives are significantly advantaged," she says. However, other studies still often show that professional women need to improve their networking skills. A 2011 report by the Toulouse School of Economics in France concluded that a major factor behind female directors earning 17% less than their male counterparts was the fact they were less good at building a network. The study found that in general the male directors had much larger networks of past acquaintances, while female directors instead focused on a few strong relationships. As she tries to build her own business, Jenn Harris attends five to six networking events every week - but says it's important not to make new contacts if you don't have time to follow them up. Vanessa Fox says she tries to be selective. "It is work for sure, and in my case there are some events that I know I'll hate and I just don't go," she says. "I try to find things that are a little more of a balance that I can enjoy and find valuable." </body>

      <body>Police are investigating whether former owner Craig Whyte is still involved at Rangers. When the Scottish FA transferred the liquidated company's membership to a new company "the key requirement" was the total lack of involvement of Whyte. Police Scotland are also examining documents filed with Companies House. Those documents lie at the heart of Whyte's claim he and former chief executive Charles Green colluded over Green's purchase of Rangers' assets. Former club chairman Malcolm Murray, now part of a group led by businessman Jim McColl seeking to be elected as a new Rangers board, quelled talk of Whyte's involvement. "I'm pretty sure he [Whyte] is not involved at all," Murray told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound programme on Monday. "I was given assurances, as the SFA were, that he wasn't. I said I wouldn't go any further if he was." Police have written to Green, who has called into question the documents filed in relation to Sevco 5088, to ask for his help in their enquiries. Green stood down from his position in April following Whyte's allegations, though an investigation funded by Rangers cleared Green of any wrongdoing. Police Scotland have been passed files by the law firm Pinsent Masons, who carried out the investigation that cleared Green. BBC Scotland has seen an email sent by police last month to a lawyer representing the former chief executive. Police Scotland will not comment on ongoing investigations. A source close to Green told BBC Scotland that he is co-operating with police, while a similarly placed source for Whyte says police have not contacted the former owner on the matter. The investigation is being carried out by Police Scotland's Economic Crime Unit. </body>

      <title>Hull chief confirms name change plan</title>
      <description>Hull City chairman Assem Allam confirms his long-term intention to rename the Premier League club Hull Tigers.</description>

      <body>Hull City chairman Assem Allam has confirmed his long-term intention to rename the club Hull Tigers. The Egypt-born businessman announced in August the company name has changed from Hull City AFC to Hull City Tigers. But any plans to alter the club name would need to be ratified by the Football Association. Hull fans' group City Til We Die hopes that could lead to an intervention and accused Allam of confusing the holding company and the football team name. A statement on its website read: "Our group has already had extensive contact with key figures at the FA, and we anticipate they will take a dim view... of this announcement." Allam says he has to find other income streams for the club as the KC Stadium is owned by the council. The 74-year-old believes a 'Tigers' brand would be more marketable, having previously said he considers the word 'City' to be "lousy" and "common". Allam said in a statement on the club website:  "Having been deprived of opportunities to acquire the stadium freehold, which would have enabled us to create the infrastructure in the surrounding area, we will now need to focus on generating commercial income from elsewhere. "A shorter club name will hopefully enable us to do so, with a stronger, quicker marketing impact all over the world." A decision on further shortening the club's name to simply Hull Tigers is expected to be made early next year. The FA's Rule 3L states: "Any application for a change of playing name must be received by the Association before 1 April in any calendar year in order for it to be considered by [the FA] Council for adoption in the following playing season. "[The] Council will use its absolute discretion in deciding whether to approve a change in a club's playing name." Steve Bruce's side, who were promoted back to the Premier League in May, are currently 12th in the top flight. The City Til We Die statement added: "We remain puzzled that Dr Allam cannot distinguish between the name of his holding company and the football name of the club he owns. "Until he registers a new name with the Football Association, the club remains Hull City AFC. His belief that we are already called Hull City Tigers, a name ripe for shortening, is therefore spectacularly ill-judged and erroneous. "Let us be clear - Dr Allam CANNOT change the football name of the club without approval of the FA, who in turn require consultation with fans." Allam, who moved to Hull in 1968 to study and has since set up a multi-million pound company in nearby Melton, took charge of the club in December 2010. At that point, they were close to entering administration after relegation from the Premier League left them with about £35m of debt. </body>

      <body>Derbyshire County Cricket Club is bidding for funding for a £3.65m redevelopment of its ground with a view to hosting a 2019 World Cup game. The club has secured £1.7m from the England and Wales Cricket Board to redevelop the County Ground. It is now looking for £1.9m in loan and grant funding from Europe, the government and local business groups. The redevelopment would include a new media centre and increase the ground's capacity from nearly 5,000 to 7,000. A club spokesman said landing a 2019 World Cup match was not crucial but the main aim of the proposal was to be eligible to be considered for international matches and improve facilities for players and spectators. The new ground could also host concerts and community events. The club had previously suggested it may have to move from its current home but, after talks with the city council, said redevelopment was the only possibility within the city of Derby. Chief executive Simon Storey said: "Now we have clarity on the council's position, it's clear that the only option available if we are stay in the city is to secure external funds to deliver the planned redevelopment of the County Ground. "We will, therefore, pursue the funding opportunities with the various bodies in the coming weeks and revisit our business plan projections and development plans accordingly." He added that the club had not completely ruled out a move to an alternative location elsewhere in the county. "We feel it's prudent for the club to continue with its evaluation of alternative options elsewhere in the county, as well as continuing our recently announced off-field operations review as we seek to reduce our on-going costs and balance our existing budgets in the short term," he said. Derbyshire were relegated from Division One of the LV County Championship in September. </body>

      <body>It's not the $1m question. It's the million Swiss francs question. It has become a depressingly universal truth in education that children from poorer backgrounds tend on average to do less well than their richer counterparts. But what would happen if you took those poorer families and gave them money, real hard cash? If you make a poor family richer, will their children's chances of success rise accordingly? Or is it too complicated for such a direct approach? Are children being held back not by lack of money, but by poverty's fellow travellers, such as bad housing, ill health, unemployment, chaotic parenting or family breakdown? Or are poor children getting stuck in a downward spiral of poorly educated parents and bad schools? A US economist, Prof Greg Duncan, has won a million Swiss franc (£680,000) research prize to find out, in an annual award by the Zurich-based Jacobs Foundation, a charity that supports research into improving childhood. Prof Duncan, an expert on the impact of poverty in childhood, wants to take a randomised group of a thousand low-income single mothers with a newborn child and give them $4,000 (£2,890) each for the first three years of the children's lives. Another control group of mothers will get a much smaller amount. Prof Duncan, from the School of Education at the University of California, Irvine, is going to to measure what happens next. The experiment will be a big, expensive, long-term venture, with the prize money supporting the pilot stage. But Prof Duncan wants this to answer some big questions about what happens if you reduce hardship in the earliest years. Can raising income deliver a measurable change in family life and children's progress? Will neuroscientists find a difference in cognitive development between those who receive the $4,000 and those who don't? "We want to see whether we can find a direct link between poverty reduction and brain development in very young children," Prof Duncan says. The idea of giving financial support to low-income families is well established - it underpins a range of family benefits, allowances and tax credits in many countries. But what this study wants to discover is the specific impact of changing income in the years before school. Prof Duncan's earlier research has suggested strong links between experiences in the early years and how adults fare in later life. This is the time when children are developing most rapidly, when the "architecture of the brain" is being established, he says. There won't be any constraints on how these low-income families spend the extra money. If families throw away the cash recklessly, rather than spending it on supporting children, that will be part of the findings. The purity of the experiment is to see what happens in the real world if poor young parents are made slightly less poor. Will their children's school performance be less poor as well? Prof Duncan's research has highlighted how the achievement gap is already entrenched by the age of five, suggesting that intervention needs to come earlier. Before pupils turn up for their first day at school, middle-class children are already ahead of their poorer classmates at such tasks as recognising letters or putting numbers in order. And children who are poor at the age of five are on a downward track that makes them more likely to leave education earlier, earn less money and suffer poor health than richer children. There are also striking differences in family structure. A poor girl is more than five times more likely to grow up and have children outside of marriage than her wealthier classmates. The experiment, which is planned to launch in 2015, will try to establish to what extent living on a low income is the "active ingredient" in such different outcomes. If parents are under less financial pressure, will they behave differently to their children? Will family time change with more spending power? The study will try to separate the low-income effect from other factors such as family relationships, individual character and personal resilience. This experiment has a particular resonance for the US education system. In the past, even though the poor in the US might have lacked some social security "safety nets", Prof Duncan says there was a very valuable compensation from public investment in the education system. It provided a ladder upwards. But that is no longer the case, he says. The US education system had been a world leader, a superpower in education as well as in economic and military terms. But more recently it has faced a stream of bad news. Last month, there was a new low ebb when the influential the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development think tank published research showing that young people in the US workforce had the lowest levels of maths skills in the developed world. Such weaknesses in education have a great significance for the life chances of children born into poverty. A major study this month from the independent Pew Research group, based in Philadelphia, looked at the factors that helped people born into low-income families in the US to rise up the income ladder. Such "rags to riches" stories are more common in Hollywood movies than in real life, the study concludes. But where people do beat the odds and rise up the ladder, the key factor is education. Getting a college degree is the surest route to social mobility, the research shows. College graduates were over five times more likely to escape the bottom rung of the ladder. Family structure was also a big influence. Two-parent families were more than three times as likely to move out of the lowest-income bracket compared with single-parent families. The study shows that education and family are the dominant influences on escaping poverty. What Prof Duncan's research will investigate is whether inserting cash into the equation can improve the odds of success. </body>

      <description>How your CV and online profile are key to your job prospects</description>

      <body>In many countries getting a job has never been more difficult and with online applications and social networking to contend with, the world of job seeking has changed dramatically in just a short period of time. So you have to have the best possible resume, which can be on paper or even on your own personal website. You also have to be aware that everything that can be found about you online could be the thing that gets you the job or gifts it to one of your competitors. The task of pulling together all the information is not for the faint-hearted. Jobseekers soon realise that building a digital profile, while promoting themselves in social media, is a full time job, in itself. These days you're so much more than just your resume on paper," says Lisa Johnson Mandell, author of Career Comeback - Repackage Yourself to Get the Job You Want. She should know, at the age of 49, Johnson Mandell, lost her job when the website she worked for closed down. As a Los Angeles-based writer, broadcaster and film critic, she had years of experience - but whenever she applied for a new job, it went to someone else. After some soul-searching with her husband, she concluded her resume aged her and dwelled too much on the past. In many countries you don't have to include your age on your CV, because of age-discrimination laws. "I took off all the work experience that was 15 years or older because nothing was relevant after that," she says. She also removed the year of her college graduation and focused on her current skills. The resume became age anonymous and, in its new form, produced instant results. "I got responses to my resumes within 20 minutes of sending them out and I got job offers within two weeks," she says, adding she was stunned by the results. The writer now coaches jobseekers on how to give their resumes a makeover. "These days, people's attention spans are short," she says. "If you can't sell yourself and put the best stuff you've got in the first third of your resume, they're going to get bored and toss it. "Nobody has time to really dig into a resume and look at the details. "They want to know right at the beginning, 'What can you do for me?'" Michael Weiss, a Los Angeles-based marketing consultant, says the resume should complement a jobseeker's digital profile. This can include a personal website and a presence on networking services. The net effect should be to make an individual stand out from the crowd. "When you are looking for a job, when you're out there, the goal is, 'How do I differentiate myself?'" says Mr Weiss. But he adds that jobseekers should not feel the need to have a presence on every social media platform, because there are too many to choose from. "It's forced people to step back and think about the strategy of the story they want to tell," he says. "There are different stories that you are going to tell on Facebook, that you are going to tell on Twitter, that you are going to tell on Tumblr, that you can't tell on Instagram. It's different for all of them." Above all, Mr Weiss says, people must tell a constant story, and it is up to individuals to decide how they should present themselves. It may be acceptable to present a less corporate image on a personal Facebook page, while maintaining a professional profile on LinkedIn. "It all comes down to your personal brand," he says. "You really want to be accurate online, you don't want to embellish stories, you don't want to undersell them, you don't want to oversell them, you just want to be right on point. "The other thing you want to do, is you want to be authentic. You want to be real. You want to be who they expect you to be and I really want people to focus on being current. "Social media is 24/7, 365 and the door to your story is always open. If you have something posted from a month ago, you already look old." Mr Weiss also warns job-seekers - especially new graduates - that they should clean up their digital profile. Party photos posted on Facebook during their years at college may not be appropriate for someone trying to enter the corporate world. "I know it was a lot of fun, I know you had a great time, but you didn't have a filter on for four years or eight years or however long you've been on there." Mr Weiss adds: "I think there's a responsibility on yourself in applying a filter when you post content. "I think there's also a responsibility to yourself to know that there's stuff out there that you need to find, just in case." </body>

      <description>How biometrics make your voice the best weapon against fraud</description>

      <body>Big business wants your voice - not for customer feedback, but to tackle fraud. Voice biometrics - the recording and analysis of unique voiceprints for authentication purposes - is one of the latest technological weapons being deployed in the war against fraudsters, thought to be pilfering at least £52bn from the UK economy each year, according to the National Fraud Authority (NFA). UK financial services companies alone are conservatively estimated to be losing more than £5bn annually, the NFA says. But the real figures are likely to be two or three times higher than this as so much fraud goes unreported. Identity theft and account takeover are a big and growing problem, particularly in a digital era that has been a boon to fraudsters by presenting them with many more ways to harvest personal data. The main advantage of voice is that it is much harder to spoof and steal. "Voice is a dynamic form of biometrics, rather than static like a fingerprint, so it is harder to replicate and copy digitally," says Emmanuelle Filsjean, global head of marketing for ValidSoft, which advises retail banks on security and helps European governments tackle cross-border benefit fraud. Digital voiceprints contain over 100 identifiable elements. And, by using complex mathematical algorithms and the latest high-definition audio equipment, voice biometric companies believe they can now identify people accurately more than 97% of the time. Even identical twins, who share the same DNA, can be told apart from their voiceprints, making the technology reliable enough to be used as evidence in courts of law. Voice is crucial because call centres are still the main way we interact with companies, despite the rise of online banking and shopping. Traditional authentication measures, involving personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords, and "memorable" answers to stock questions, have proved fallible, largely because we are fallible - we keep forgetting them. This is why we choose ludicrously simple PINs and passwords that are easy for us to remember - and therefore for others to guess. Fraud investigators have found that about 10% of four-digit PINs stolen by fraudsters are simply 1-2-3-4, while banks report legitimate customers failing call centre authentication procedures 10% to 20% of the time because they cannot remember their security details. "You can't forget your voice," says Prof Levent Arslan, chief executive of Sestek, a technology company that helped Turkish mobile phone company Avea register one million voiceprints in a year. Your voice is also easy to use. "Using our voice is the most intuitive way of interacting," says Ms Filsjean. While no biometrics security system is totally foolproof, fraudsters using high-definition recordings of someone's telephone pass phrase should still be caught out, voice biometrics companies maintain, because even the highest-quality recordings use some form of compression that blunts the highest and lowest frequencies. Even a slight mismatch with the customer's voiceprint will trigger a "live test" conversation that is almost impossible for fraudsters to spoof, particularly if they've only got a recording to use. Barclays' private banking arm, Barclays Wealth, claims great success after implementing voice biometrics. Before introducing the technology, it found that 25% of fraudulent phone calls to its agents were able to bypass the bank's security systems. Fraudsters using "social engineering" techniques - or blagging in the vernacular - were able to elicit security details from agents. The bank would not disclose how much money was being lost as a result. Barclays says that now the number of successful fraudulent calls is zero, because it uses technology from the company behind Apple iPhone's Siri speech recognition system, Nuance, a leader in the field. The voiceprints of suspected fraudsters are kept on a watchlist so they can be identified if they try again pretending to be someone else. Slovakian Tatra Bank is currently rolling out a voice biometric system that will authenticate customer identities while they are speaking to call centre agents. About 10 to 15 seconds of natural conversation is enough to match the voiceprint with the one the bank has on record. Turkish mobile phone operator, Turkcell, now has about 10 million customer voiceprints on its database. "Most financial institutions and big service providers around the world are actively considering adopting voice biometrics," says Almog Aley-Raz, head of voice biometrics for Nuance. The tricky part is enrolling customers in the scheme, as different jurisdictions have their own privacy laws governing voice recording. "In many cases there is ambiguity around the collection and use of biometrics," says Mr Aley-Raz. "But our best practice recommendation to our customers is to obtain consent for using the technology. "Regardless of whether a given jurisdiction has specific provision for the use of biometrics, biometric data is personal, private, and should be treated with the same care as any other data of that type." Voice biometrics alone is not enough to combat fraud, however. Other technologies, such as communications data analytics, must come into play. 'Profound' All UK financial institutions have had to record phone calls for years, and this has led to gargantuan amounts of data sitting in servers, largely ignored. But now audio and video search software, coupled with sophisticated analytical tools, is making this data mountain much more easily accessible and useful. "The enormously sophisticated technologies that dig into written communication are now being switched to the spoken word," says Richard Newton, co-founder of OP3NVoice, a technology company specialising in searchable audio and video recording. "This has profound implications for fraud detection. Analysis of emotions, stress, sentiment, and meaning is a fast-developing area." What you say, how you say it, when, where and to whom, can all be weighted by algorithms that learn to spot suspicious or anomalous patterns of behaviour. As Glenn Perachio, forensics specialist at accountancy firm Ernst and Young, says: "It's like searching for a hay-coloured needle in a haystack, so you need to adopt techniques, such as machine learning, topic modelling, and geo-spatial mapping, to help narrow down the search for that evidence of malfeasance." Voice biometrics and speech analytics, it seems, are finally striking a true - and productive - note. </body>

      <title>Escape to Oz</title>
      <description>Young Europeans head to Australia in search of work</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24854519</url>

      <body>Australia has become a haven for disillusioned young Europeans eager to plot an escape from economic troubles at home. Migration from countries such as Ireland is at levels not seen since the 1980s as Australia's seemingly bulletproof economy, insulated from the global slowdown by a roaring mining industry, offers the chance of a fresh beginning. But there are concerns that a flood of migrants in their early-to-mid-20s from Ireland and elsewhere on temporary working visas is squeezing young Australians out of the jobs market. "If we look at between 15-19-year-olds, we have 14.5% unemployment. Still well below many other places in the world but still significant enough to say that we aren't absorbing and giving skill opportunities to many young Australians, so the government has failed to get the balance right," says Tony Sheldon, from the Australian Transport Workers Union. "That means that labour has been brought in as an alternative, which is being more exploited, [has] less rights and [is] seen as a cheap form of labour but also an exploited form of labour." he says. He fears that foreigners could also be under-paid and mistreated by unscrupulous bosses. On a wild and blustery evening at Bondi Beach, Aoife Fahey and her friends frolic in the shallows after work. Ireland's chronic financial problems seem a world away as the surf crashes into Sydney's famous arc of sand, yet building a new life isn't easy. "[It's] a lot harder than people make out, 'Come over to Australia, there's loads of jobs, [it's] so easy.' It is not like that at all, no matter what you're working in. It's for lads a lot easier, but for girls it's hard," says Aoife, from Castlebar in County Mayo, who arrived in Australia six months ago and works in an Irish pub. Her friend, Michaela Kelly, from Drogheda, earns twice as much working in an office in Sydney than she did in Ireland. Like many Irish backpackers Michaela is well qualified with a degree in business. But with youth unemployment so stubbornly high in Australia, soaring up to 40% in parts of its major cities does she feel guilty that she could be taking a job from a local? "Is that bad if I say no?" she asks. "Irish workers come over here to work and they work hard because at home you are made to work hard, whereas Australians over here are just so laid back, they put things off and don't do it, basically. So, I don't feel bad." Most Irish backpackers arrive on one-year working holiday permits, which can be extended or upgraded to longer employment visas that can lead to residency and eventually citizenship although the process can take years. Australia owes an incalculable economic debt to successive waves of immigration over the decades, including legions of settlers from Ireland but academics now worry that a lack of training could increasingly leave young Australians unable to compete with temporary foreign workers especially in low or unskilled jobs. "It is important to think about where future immigrants are going and whether that competition could emerge," says Anna Boucher, from the University of Sydney. "I don't see it really coming out currently, but I see it potentially being a problem in the future. For instance, somewhere like the Northern Territory that has very high rates of indigenous youth unemployment but which is being signalled as an area for potential regional migration agreements in the future." Australia is grappling with chronic skills shortages in many sectors while seeking antidotes to worrying rates of jobless among its young. Meanwhile, this vast nation continues to invite those seeking work from afar to its shores. "You're watching [TV shows] Neighbours and Home And Away and you're just expecting everything to be perfect," says Denise Murtagh, who arrived in Sydney from Dublin with her best friend only a week ago. "But it is tough going because you're basically living out of a bag. You're moving from place to place every few days." "We haven't a clue what we are doing at the minute," adds Sinead Keane, who has come armed with a degree in business and sports management. "There's thousands of people in the same boat as us looking for jobs so I suppose you just have to talk to people and hope they help you out along the way." The Irish government says it's confident that parts of the diaspora in Sydney and beyond will succumb to the magnetic pull of home when the scars of the financial crisis eventually heal. But, for now, as the exodus of the young continues, Ireland's loss is Australia's gain. </body>

      <title>Champions League TV deal in focus</title>
      <description>BT shakes sports TV with its Champions League deal</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24895491</url>

      <body>The football and broadcast worlds are still digesting the impact of BT Sport's decision to pay close to £900m for the exclusive broadcast rights to Champions League and Europa League football matches. The broadcaster has won the rights to show all 350 fixtures each season, for three years from 2015. The new contract, priced at £299m a season, is worth more than double the current arrangement, and could mean significantly more money for UK clubs in the two European competitions. But what does it mean for the sporting and business ambitions of BT Sport, as well as Sky and ITV, the current rights holders? Here Kevin McCullagh, deputy editor of industry publication TV Sports Markets, offers his opinion on where it has left the three broadcast players. "What this deal really does is provide another sign that BT really is a different proposition from Sky's previous and most recent competitors in the pay football market - Setanta and ESPN. "The size of this deal and the fact it is such an exclusive deal for such a major competition like the Champions League makes it far different from anything those others managed. "And the amount of money BT has put on the table is of a totally different order that what we have seen before. It shows BT has the financial resources, but also the stomach, for a battle with Sky. "They clearly see televised sport as a very expensive and long-term play. But have they paid too much? That is the huge question. "BT really needed to spend big money to get a toehold in a market dominated by Sky. "It is also worthwhile remembering BT launched its sports channels as a means of remaining a major triple-play player - that is, a provider of TV, internet and telephone services. "Before the launch of the sport channels, Sky was really making inroads and taking away BT broadband customers. The £900m is not only to add more sports TV subscribers, but to protect their broadband base, which is a much bigger business. "If BT is still the biggest triple player in 10 to 15 years, they will look back and see this period - and Champions League expenditure - as being worthwhile. "And by offering their sports products to their broadband subscribers, they are also positioning themselves as the choice for the budget-conscious fan. "They haven't announced their plans yet for the free-to-air games they will show. They don't have a free-to-air channel and I can't see them launching one. "So their options are: a) to un-encrypt their pay TV channels during these matches, or b) sub-license on to a free-to-air partner such as BBC or ITV. "The best thing for BT would be to keep everything on their channels. This allows them to put out the strong marketing message of BT being the only place to watch Champions League/Europa League football." "It is a massive blow for Sky. The importance of the Champions League should not be underestimated, nor what a major TV sports rights property it is in the UK. "It is probably the biggest sporting rights auction Sky has lost. "It is the second biggest subscriber driver after the Premier League, and Sky will feel the impact of this. "However, Sky has still has a top portfolio, and has got other major sports rights, as well as a broader offering than BT. "It has a really wide sports offering - including exclusivity to half of the Formula 1 races, England and Wales cricket, La Liga top flight Spanish football, and a major range of golf events. "This announcement has come as Sky is pouring money into other areas, for example original British drama. "By offering an increasing breadth of content, Sky is looking to give people other reasons to buy Sky subscriptions, rather than BT's. "Going back to sport, I don't think that there is anything very obvious that Sky can go out and buy right now to replace the Champions League rights. "I think they will look to weaken BT Sport when it comes to the next round of Premier League TV rights in England. "Sky currently has 118 live games a season compared with BT's 38 a season. "But where BT has done better than Setanta or ESPN is in the number of "first picks" broadcast choices - BT managed to win 18 games, whereas their predecessors got none. "I think Sky will be looking next time round to reduce BT's number of first picks." "This will have hit ITV too, as over the decades they have become the terrestrial television home of Champions League football. They have also been showing the Europa League on ITV4. "With BT grabbing the Champions League rights, it means that ITV loses its top televised football competition. although they do have live England internationals, which attract strong viewing figures. "But, having lost the FA Cup to the BBC, ITV now has no top-level live club football. "The upside is that the CL and EL were expensive and this has freed up a large chunk of budget that they can spend on other content. They will have roughly £50m a year available to spend that is currently going on Champions League football rights. "They may need to invest in midweek evening content for young men. "But, again as with Sky, there is not a lot of available football or other sports rights out there to replace the Champions League. "What has happened to ITV is being seen around the world, where the big global TV sports rights are all migrating to pay-TV. "It is the most compelling way to bring people on board as pay-subscribers. "I am talking about seasonal-long events, such as the Premier League or Champions League, where you have a series of games and can build interest and a following over a year (rather than a World Cup or Olympic Games). "As a result we are seeing a growth in value in top sporting TV rights." </body>

      <title>Women bankers break through in India</title>
      <description>How women are calling the shots at some of India's top banks</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24867346</url>
      <date>1384214580</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/71044000/jpg/_71044539_71044458.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Women have always worked in India, but the rise of the corporate woman in the last two decades in the banking sector has been phenomenal. India has no fewer than eight female banking bosses - indeed the appointment of Arundhati Bhattacharya as the first chairwoman of the country's largest bank, the State Bank of India, came days before the announcement of the new Federal Reserve nominee in the US, Janet Yellen. It's a stark contrast to places like the UK, where women run the British arm of international banks, but there are no overall female bosses. So how has India done it? And the reason for it is very simple, according to Chanda Kochhar, the chief executive of ICICI, the country's second largest bank - the company promoted on merit, not gender. "When you have an organisation that is gender neutral, and when you have a woman who is willing to give to her job whatever it takes, whether it's long hours, whether it's commitment to travel, irrespective of the fact that she's a woman, I think women get that opportunity to rise," she says. There were, of course, sacrifices. "What it required on my part was to really give to the job whatever it took. So yes, there were children at home, but if the job demands travel, hard work, long hours of work, I think you need to give it." ICICI is seen by many within the industry as a training ground for ambitious women. Typically, a third of its intake will be female, and the bank has made a point of nurturing talent and creating a whole crop of successful women. They include Shikha Sharma, chief executive of Axis Bank. "There's no substitute for meritocracy and there's no substitute for hard work," she says. "But there is the issue of women having the belief that they can make it, and everybody in society becoming sensitive to the fact that women can make it. "The presence of more women helps both those beliefs to happen, for women to have the belief, and for society to have the sensitivity to understand that yes, women bring a different level of contribution." Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management in south Mumbai trains those who will be the corporate bosses of the future, and counts Chanda Kochhar as a former student. Each year, the institute takes 125 young men and women, and competition to get in is fierce, with around 1,000 applications per place. Student Aditi Agarwal says she's very ambitious, but has had her own battles to get on. "I think women are just tired of being at home, they want to break out of those shackles," she says. "I can say this from experience - when I decided to study further for my chartered accountancy course, I didn't get a lot of support from my extended family. There was that mindset to have kids, make dinner for your husband - that's what's expected of you. "But I want to work, I want to make a contribution. I have a personal sense of identity." Fellow student Ekta Ambekar says there are lots of female role models now in banking, and she's sure she'll have the same chance to succeed as men. "Women are surely breaking the glass ceiling, and after all it's more about the talent that you have, and less about all the social constraints. It's always the talent and hard work that pays… your work speaks for itself." So why has banking distinguished itself when it comes to promoting women? According to Tarjani Vakil, who was India's first female banking chief executive in the 1990s, the sector expanded in the 1970s when banks were nationalised, and that coincided with increasing numbers of middle-class women entering the workplace. For her, it was lonely being the only woman at the top, but banking was always seen as a good job for women. "Women joined because it was a dream job for them," she says. "Banks were well organised. It was a safe place to work, because you didn't have to go to a factory, so the family didn't object. Women went to the office, sat in an air-conditioned office, and were very happy. "It was glamorous, and money is always glamour." She says at the outset the ceiling was concrete rather than glass, but that now it's been well and truly smashed. The structure of Indian society allows for issues like childcare to be less of a problem than in the West. The prevalence of extended families means that grandparents are around if a woman goes out to work, and all middle-class women have domestic help. Those women who have made it to the top will probably have had these advantages, as well as working hard for their success. India remains a largely conservative society, with traditional attitudes about the role of women in many regions. The country did a lot of soul-searching about its treatment of women after a brutal rape in the capital last year. But despite the major social challenges the country faces, the corporate world seems to have set its own progressive standards, particularly in the financial sector. Some think other industries will soon follow suit. P Vaidyanathan Iyer, the editor of the Mumbai edition of the Indian Express, says the educated middle-class now equals 250 million people - and it's the sheer size of that still growing white-collar workforce that bodes well for the future. "I'm sure in the next few years, or the next decade or so, you will have women doing very well in sectors like healthcare and information technology where we have a middle ground now of very successful and bright women in the middle-corporate levels. "These are areas where we have built a huge workforce of women, and it won't be surprising that you will find more chief executives." The problems of poverty and social inequality in wider Indian society persist. But in banking at least there has been a female corporate revolution - and this could be just the beginning. </body>

      <title>Energy bill hikes 'to last 17 years'</title>
      <description>Consumers face 17 more years of above-inflation increases in energy and water bills, Whitehall's spending watchdog warns.</description>

      <body>Consumers face 17 more years of above-inflation increases in energy and water bills as they help pay for the renewal of the UK's infrastructure, Whitehall's spending watchdog has warned. The National Audit Office added that "gaps" in the official analysis meant government lacked "an overall picture of affordability". It expressed particular concern about low-income households. But the government said it was "committed" to keeping bills down. Fuel costs have become a highly charged political issue in recent months. Five of the UK's six main energy companies have announced price rises, at an average of 8.1%. On Tuesday, EDF Energy became the latest provider to increase bills, by an average of 3.9%. Alan Young, from energy company SSE, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "Standards in this industry do need to improve." But he denied his company was trying to make a "quick buck" from its customers. "We're interested in making a sustainable profit that allows us to invest in the long term," he said. "This country has had reliable supplies of energy. When people have gone to switch the lights on, they have come on. "Have there been shortcomings in standards? Absolutely. Is there a commitment on our part to improve them? Totally. "But fundamentally people have got reliable supplies of energy for their money. We're concerned that they should continue to do so, but in a way that is affordable." In September, Labour leader Ed Miliband announced plans for a 20-month energy price freeze from May 2015, should his party win the next election. And the government has launched a competition review and will review green and social charges, responsible for some of the cost of bills. In an escalation of rhetoric, Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey told an industry conference on Tuesday that firms should not use customers as "cash cows". The Treasury estimates that at least two-thirds of the £310bn of planned infrastructure investment over the next decade and beyond will come from private companies, ultimately paid for by consumers. In its report, the National Audit Office (NAO) said it was estimated there would be an 18% average real-terms increase in household energy bills between now and 2030. For water, the figure would be 28%. The NAO also said: "Affordability can only be assessed taking into account all household bills, household incomes and wider costs of living. "Gaps in analysis, and the lack of a common approach to measuring affordability, mean that the government does not have an overall picture of affordability, either for the average household or for those on low incomes." The NAO expressed particular concern about the plight of the low-income households where energy and water bills accounted for 15% of spending in 2011 - almost double the overall average of 8% - while their incomes had fallen by 11% in real terms since 2002. A Conservative source said: "We agree with the NAO that government should 'rigorously scrutinise all decisions on both value for money and affordability grounds', that is why the prime minister has announced that we need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills at the Autumn Statement." And a government spokesman said: "Decades of underinvestment have left the UK struggling with insufficient energy infrastructure, but we are committed to fixing the failures of previous governments, and to making the difficult decisions that will allow us to have the infrastructure we need. "The government is committed to supporting hard-working families and that's why we're cutting tax for 25 million people and taking 2.7 million people out of income tax altogether by 2014, helping the most vulnerable with their bills, freezing fuel duty and sticking to the economic plan that has got all sectors of the economy growing." </body>

      <body>Nick Clegg will launch an attack on Labour's economic policy, urging voters not to be "fooled again" in the run-up to the next general election. The deputy prime minister will say the coalition's priority remains "clearing up the mess" left by Gordon Brown's government in 2010. While defending austerity policies, he will say his Lib Dems did not enter Downing Street "just to make cuts". But Labour argues coalition policies have delayed the recovery. UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show. Speaking at a supermarket in west London, Mr Clegg will say this has not dimmed the determination of the Lib Dems and Conservatives to cut the deficit. He will say: "Three and a half years in and the coalition's priority is still the same - fixing the economy and cleaning up the mess Labour left behind. "That task has never been simply about balancing the books. We inherited an economy that had become profoundly unbalanced. Growth was driven almost entirely by one industry, financial services. Almost exclusively from one city - London. And behind the boom was a nation becoming less productive and less competitive. For years governments had simply papered over the cracks. "So my party didn't come into government just to make cuts. For us, this has always been about setting in motion a much more fundamental overhaul of our economy so that Britain never finds itself here again." The deputy prime minister will warn there are "no quick fixes" and the coalition is "seeing through the difficult decisions on the deficit". He will add: "Ironically, the people who still underestimate what's required are Labour - the party that got us here. "This is a party that wants to get back into government in 18 months, yet the sum total of their plan seems to be a single promise to temporarily freeze energy bills. "As always, if it sounds too good to be true, it is. The energy companies would simply hike up prices before and after the freeze and Labour could do nothing to stop them." Mr Clegg will say: "So don't be fooled again: you cannot afford Labour. Let loose in government on their own they would wreck the recovery - costing jobs, driving up interest rates and undermining the growth needed to cut tax bills and fund public services. "They cannot be allowed to undo all of the sacrifices that have been made and everything that has been achieved - the British people would pay the price." For Labour, shadow chancellor Ed Balls has called the improvement in the economy "long overdue". The coalition government had "started to claw back some lost ground", but more needed to be done to improve living standards, he said. On Monday, Prime Minister David Cameron used his speech at the Lord Mayor's banquet to express his desire for a "smaller, leaner state... not just now, but permanently". </body>

      <title>Warning of NI reform delay penalty</title>
      <description>The work and pensions minister, Mike Penning, renews pressure on the Northern Ireland Executive to pass its Welfare Reform Bill</description>

      <body>The work and pensions minister has renewed pressure on the Northern Ireland Executive to pass its Welfare Reform Bill. Mike Penning also warned that Stormont faces millions of pounds in penalties over the delay. He is due to meet NI's social development minister in Belfast later. The reforms are being introduced at Westminster and include a new universal credit payment to replace child tax credit and housing benefit. But the legislation is still going through the assembly at Stormont. It was pulled by Social Development Minister Nelson McCausland in April, before it could reach the Northern Ireland assembly's consideration stage. The Treasury has said the financial implications of delays to Northern Ireland implementing reforms equate to about £5m of lost savings every month. It has said that unless the reforms are introduced in Northern Ireland, the block grant will have to be reduced in order to compensate for lost savings. Speaking ahead of the meeting, Mr Penning said he was hoping to find a way forward "to avoid substantial reductions in funding and to ensure there's a system in place that is right for claimants and fair to taxpayers both in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK".‪ "While this is ultimately a devolved matter, I'm concerned about the lack of progress that has been made which has already cost over £30m in lost savings and this figure is increasing by around £5m every month," he said. "If this continues we are potentially talking about tens of millions of pounds more that will need to be found elsewhere by the Northern Ireland Executive.‪‪" There have been claims that the financial impact is greater in Northern Ireland than other parts of the UK because of the large number of people who claim Incapacity Benefit (IB) and Disability Living Allowance (DLA). Mr McCausland said: "I am committed to taking the Welfare Reform Bill through the assembly as soon as the parties in the executive can agree to move forward to consideration stage. "I have developed a package of measures which I believe shapes welfare reform to meet the needs of the people of Northern Ireland. "I would hope to be able to bring this package, to the executive in the very near future." Sinn Féin MLA Alex Maskey sits on the social development committee. "We're being threatened basically by the British government to penalise us further for trying to make sure that we represent the interests of the people here, that we represent, that no Tory represents," he said. The Welfare Reform Bill marks the biggest overhaul of the benefits system since the 1940s. Mr McCausland has also said the Northern Ireland Executive received £6.5bn from the Treasury through tax credit and social security, with the contribution from the National Insurance Fund in Northern Ireland amounting to £2.5bn. He warned that should the executive fail to agree welfare reform and therefore break with GB parity there was a "potential £4bn" shortfall for Northern Ireland's budget. </body>

      <title>NHS shake-up proposes two-tier A&amp;E</title>
      <description>A two-tier A&amp;E system in England should be created as part of an overhaul of services, NHS chiefs are proposing.</description>

      <body>A two-tier AandE system in England should be created as part of an overhaul of services, NHS chiefs say. The review by NHS England suggested the biggest 40 to 70 units - specialising in heart attacks, strokes and trauma - be called major emergency centres. It would leave the remaining 70 to 100 AandEs - known as emergency centres - to deal with less serious conditions. It also suggested changes to the way ambulance crews and the new 111 phone service work to "decongest" AandEs. Greater co-ordination between community services, such as GPs and pharmacists, would also help, it said. The measures have been put forward in response to the growing pressures on accident and emergency departments. Patient numbers have risen by 50% in the past decade and last winter the problems got so severe that the NHS missed its four-hour waiting time target. Extra money has been set aside to help the NHS through this winter and the next one. But this review aims to set out the long-term vision for the service. Many of the proposals are already in operation somewhere and in essence the review is calling for this to be formalised across the system. For example, there are already a number of AandE units that act as major centres in everything but name. But by setting a target of having between 40 and 70 major emergency centres it means this will have to be extended across the health service. NHS medical director Prof Sir Bruce Keogh, who led the review, said: "AandE is creaking at the seams. It is not broken, but it is struggling. "We need to change the way we work. But what we are suggesting here already exists in places, we are just trying to formalise it so it is available for everyone." The review said there also needed to be further changes to the system if pressure was going to be relieved. About 40% of people who attend AandE do not need treating there. What is more, the problems developed by a fifth of patients who are eventually admitted to hospital with emergency conditions could have been avoided with better and earlier treatment in the community. The review said key to tackling these problems was ensuring patients got access to the services that were best suited to them first time. To achieve this, 111, which has been beset by problems since it was launched in April to replace NHS Direct, will need to be much more responsive, giving patients direct phone access to doctors, nurses and other health professionals. Ambulance crews will need to treat more patients at the scene to reduce the number of patients transferred to hospital. Meanwhile, there needs to be greater co-ordination between GPs, pharmacists and the network of minor injury clinics and walk-in centres to give patients 24/7 access to care outside of hospital. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said Labour welcomed Sir Bruce's report but deplored "the government's attempt to avoid presenting it to Parliament and abdicate all responsibility for the crisis in AandE". "Ministers said this report would have lessons for the immediate winter, as well as the longer term," he added. "But they are failing to act and their response remains 'crisis, what crisis'? They are forcing AandEs to go into winter with too few nurses, doctors and beds." He said the prime minister had "made it harder to get a GP appointment, closed NHS walk-in centres and scrapped NHS Direct, leaving people with no alternative but to go to AandE". Patients Association chief executive Katherine Murphy said the review had presented a "promising vision". "At present there is genuine confusion amongst some patients, who then opt for AandE as a safe default option," she added. College of Emergency Medicine president Dr Clifford Mann welcomed the proposals, although he said NHS chiefs would need to be careful the reorganisation of AandEs did not lead to "detrimental" increased journey times. He also said: "Any plan to provide emergency care must be based upon an adequate number of appropriately skilled clinicians and on this matter the review is disappointingly silent." The changes will now go out to consultation and the review team will spend the next six months looking at the cost and staffing implications before producing another report in the spring. It is likely to take three to five years before the overhaul is completed. </body>

      <title>Labour loses housing benefit vote</title>
      <description>The government has seen off a Labour challenge to its housing benefit changes in the House of Commons, with two Lib Dems rebelling.</description>

      <body>The government has seen off a Labour challenge to its housing benefit changes in the House of Commons. MPs voted by a majority of 26 to reject what critics have dubbed the "bedroom tax", removing some payments if council tenants' properties are deemed to be under-occupied. But two Liberal Democrat MPs - Andrew George and party president Tim Farron - backed Labour's motion. The government says it hopes to save £500m as a result of the changes. It argues that its policy, which it calls the abolition of a "spare-room subsidy", was introduced to reduce the housing benefit bill and free up homes for families living in overcrowded conditions. In the Commons, Labour's work and pensions secretary, Rachel Reeves, urged Liberal Democrats to back her party and vote for the abolition of the coalition changes. She said it was a "shame" Lib Dem Pensions Minister Steve Webb had not listened "to his own party who only in September at the Liberal Democrat party conference voted overwhelmingly against the bedroom tax, saying that it is 'discriminating against the most vulnerable in society'". Ms Reeves added: "But I am afraid that's what you get with the Liberal Democrats. They say one thing at their conference and when they are out on the doorsteps, but they vote another way in here when it really counts. "When they could make a difference, they turn the other way." "I say shame on him and shame on his party," Ms Reeves told MPs. But Mr Webb said: "We need action on overcrowding. We need fairness between social and private tenants. We need action on the deficit. "The party opposite has no answer to these problems. The coalition has answered them." The government defeated Labour's motion by 26 votes - less than its usual majority in Commons votes, which in normal circumstances is more than 50. An amendment tabled by Prime Minister David Cameron- which noted the "need to bring expenditure on housing benefit under control" - passed by 253 votes to 222 - a majority of 31. Twenty-one Lib Dems did not take part in either vote. It is unclear whether they abstained or had a prior reason to be absent. One Tory MP, Andrew Percy, formally abstained on Labour's motion by voting for and against it. Earlier, a separate Commons Early Day Motion - effectively an expression of opinion - tabled by four Lib Dem MPs, said the "under-occupancy penalty" had been a "mistake and should not have been introduced". Signed by Greg Mulholland, Ian Swales, Adrian Sanders and Roger Williams, it said more homes were empty as a result. It added that it would "not achieve the savings projected for it and that as constructed it is likely to have unforeseen consequences that will be unfair to certain groups and individuals". The alteration had the "perverse consequence that in some areas there are more larger properties now lying empty and with inadequate smaller housing", it said. </body>

      <title>Inflation falls to 2.2% in October</title>

      <body>The UK's inflation rate, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), fell to 2.2% in October from 2.7% the month before. The surprise fall saw CPI inflation drop to its lowest rate for more than a year, and eases pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates. The figure was below forecasts of 2.5% and is the lowest since September 2012. The Office for National Statistics said the fall was driven by the biggest drop in transport prices since July 2009. It said transport prices fell by 1.5% between September and October. One major transport cost factor came from fuel price cuts at many major supermarket chains engaged in a price war. There were also downwards price movements on some air fares. Another inflation fall came in education costs, with the impact of rising tuition fees being smaller than at the same time a year previously. And food inflation fell too, from 4.8% to 4.3%. "Falling petrol and diesel prices seem to have done the most to drag the inflation rate down, and the ongoing softness in Brent crude prices means there may be a little more of this to come in the months ahead," said economist Rob Carnell at ING. "There was also some price softness in furniture and household items too." A separate measure of inflation, the retail prices index (RPI), fell from 3.2% in September to 2.6% in October. The drop in the inflation rate means the Bank of England is considerably closer to its inflation target of 2%, which it has exceeded since December 2009. However, recently announced price rises by most of the UK's large energy firms have yet to take effect and will have an inflationary impact in the coming months. The Bank will publish its latest inflation forecast on Wednesday. "The Bank of England's forward guidance states that a hike in interest will not be considered until unemployment drops below 7%," said economist Chris Williamson at Markit. He said the Bank's forecast was likely to "bring forward when the Bank expects this to happen from late 2016 to perhaps late 2015, given the recent flow of stronger than expected economic data". </body>

      <title>Blunkett riot warning over Roma</title>
      <description>Former Home Secretary David Blunkett says he fears riots unless the Roma migrant community make more of an effort to adapt to the British way of life.</description>

      <body>Tensions between local people and Roma migrants could escalate into rioting unless action is taken to improve integration, David Blunkett has warned. The former home secretary fears a repeat of race riots that hit northern cities in 2001. His concerns centre on the Page Hall area of Sheffield, where Roma migrants from Slovakia have set up home. But he also accused the government of "burying their head in the sand" over the scale of Roma settlement in the UK. In an interview with BBC Radio Sheffield, he said the Roma community had to make more of an effort to fit in with British culture. "We have got to change the behaviour and the culture of the incoming community, the Roma community, because there's going to be an explosion otherwise. We all know that." The Sheffield Brightside MP said he feared a repeat of the violence that erupted between Asian and white youths in Bradford and other cities in 2001. "If everything exploded, if things went really wrong, the community would obviously be devastated. We saw this in Bradford, Burnley and Oldham all those years ago when I first became home secretary. We saw that the community itself were the losers." He called on the Roma community in Page Hall to change aspects of their "behaviour", such as congregating on the streets on summer evenings and dumping litter, which he said was "aggravating" local people. "We've got to be tough and robust in saying to people you are not in a downtrodden village or woodland, because many of them don't even live in areas where there are toilets or refuse collection facilities. You are not there any more, you are here - and you've got to adhere to our standards, and to our way of behaving, and if you do then you'll get a welcome and people will support you." Mr Blunkett said the local population in Page Hall, which he said was made up of people with "Pakistani backgrounds, Somali, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Yemeni and traditional white working class" also had to make an effort to reach out to the Roma community. "By all means express how you feel but do something with us. Join the people who are doing something about it," he told them. The MP said "phenomenal" progress was being made by community groups to improve integration in Page Hall but the government's decision to axe Labour's Migration Impact Fund - a £50m pot for councils to ease pressure on housing, schools and hospitals - was hampering these efforts. "We are not asking for a lot of money. We are just asking for a bit of understanding from government. A bit of interest. The government's just not interested. It's absolutely pivotal to holding this community together." And he accused the government of "burying their head in the sand" over the size of the Roma community living in the UK, which he said was revealed in a recent study by Salford University. "They [the government] have been saying there is less than 50,000 Roma in England. The Salford study shows that at a very conservative estimate, there's over 200,000. That they constitute a very large minority, with real problems." He suggested the government's refusal to officially acknowledge the scale of Roma settlement in the UK was preventing it from accessing EU funds to aid integration - a point echoed by Sylvia Ingmire, chief executive of the Roma Support Group charity. Ms Ingmire also backed Mr Blunkett's call for the restoration of government funds to boost local services in areas affected by high immigration - but she also stressed the reasons why Roma families chose to settle in the UK. "With the growth of state harassment and neo-Nazi violence in East/Central Europe, Roma families have settled in the UK, contributing economically and culturally. "More recent Roma migrants, however, carry the double burden of both a tough, discriminatory environment in countries of origin, and the winds of austerity and hostility in the UK. "We acknowledge that these pressures are also faced by many longer-established residents. "Up until 2011, the availability of targeted funds from government helped in both strengthening local services, and making them more responsive to immediate needs of the newly arrived and the longer-term residents." A government spokesman said the coalition had cut net migration "by a third" and was attempting to "address the 'pull' factors that previously led to unsustainable impacts on this country". The spokesman added: "Salford University figures should be treated with extreme caution, as they are estimates based on replies from only a third of local authorities and rely on anecdotal information. "The Migration Impacts Fund was a two-year scheme created by the last administration. "Coalition ministers did not view the scheme as particularly effective or value for money, especially given the need to tackle the budget deficit inherited by the government." Mr Blunkett's intervention was praised by UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who campaigns against the ending of border controls for migrants from Romania and Bulgaria, both countries with significant Roma populations. He said: "Mr Blunkett should be admired for the courage he has shown by speaking so plainly on this issue. Of course, the type of language he has used I would have been utterly condemned for using. "The fact that he is talking of the significant difficulties with the Roma population already in his constituency should be taken seriously by the likes of Cameron, Clegg and Miliband. "My question is if they won't listen to the dangers of opening the door to Romania and Bulgaria next year when UKIP speak out on it, will they listen to David Blunkett? I certainly hope so." Mr Blunkett later issued a statement distancing himself from Mr Farage's endorsement, stressing he had been talking about the need for better integration. </body>

      <title>Tell MPs before Twitter, says Bercow</title>

      <body>Speaker John Bercow has told the government not to make announcements about parliamentary business on Twitter before informing the House of Commons. The warning comes after Chancellor George Osborne revealed on the social networking website that his Autumn Statement was being put back by a day because of a trade mission to China. In the Commons, Labour asked Mr Bercow if this was "appropriate". He replied that it would have been "courteous" to inform the House first. The Autumn Statement, which had been scheduled for Wednesday 4 December, has been delayed until the next day because Prime Minister David Cameron is leading a trade delegation to the China and would not have been back in time. Mr Osborne revealed the change on Twitter on Monday night, saying: "The PM is visiting China in early Dec to strengthen economic ties so I will deliver the Autumn Statement on Thurs 5th December." Mr Cameron, during his annual address to the lord mayor's banquet in the City of London, said he wanted to open up markets for British companies while bringing more Chinese investment into the UK. But shadow Commons leader Angela Eagle raised a point of order in the Commons, asking: "Aside from the spectacle of major announcements to this House being arbitrarily shifted around to avoid inconveniencing the Chinese Communist Party, is it appropriate that the chancellor announced this change on Twitter and not to this House?" Mr Bercow replied: "The original date of the Autumn Statement was announced to the House at an earlier Business Questions, and I'm sure we are all extremely grateful for the long notice given. "However, if something has been announced to the House about its future business, I would consider it courteous for the House to be informed formally of any change before the wider world is. "A written statement would usually suffice, if there were not sufficient occasion or urgency to justify a supplementary business statement." Commons Leader Andrew Lansley confirmed the change of date. Mr Bercow said: "I hope you will have heard the statement from the chair, to put it very candidly and bluntly these announcements should be made to the House not by the mechanism of Twitter. I think it's pretty clear." </body>

      <title>Terror suspects 'risk mosque ban'</title>
      <description>The home secretary could ban terror suspects who are subject to orders restricting their movement from going to mosques, the government's chief anti-terrorism official tells MPs.</description>

      <body>The home secretary could ban terror suspects who are subject to orders restricting their movement from going to mosques, the government's chief anti-terrorism official has said. Charles Farr told MPs some suspects on Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPims) may have "exploited" mosque visits. Mr Farr was giving evidence to the Commons Home Affairs committee. The hearing comes after a TPims suspect fled after leaving a mosque in a burka. Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, allegedly linked to Somali militant group al-Shabab, has not been seen since he left the west London mosque last week in disguise. Of the mosque ban, Mr Farr said: "The home secretary has raised the view that amongst the restrictions that could be and should be imposed on TPim subjects, prohibition in certain or all mosques may be one, and those mosques would be determined by understanding from each TPims person which mosques they frequent." He added: "Any step in this direction would have to be taken very carefully." He also revealed Mr Mohamed was released on bail by the courts three times - not twice as previously thought - after being arrested and charged with alleged breaches of his TPims. Mr Farr, director of the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism, said the British Embassy gave Mr Mohamed travel documents to return to the UK when he was deported from Somaliland in 2011 because he did not have a British passport with him. Asked by MPs why this happened, Mr Farr said officials were obliged to facilitate his return because he was a British national. Mr Farr also said the government was considering plans to remove British citizenship from foreign terror suspects even if it left them stateless. Earlier, the committee heard from the independent reviewer of terror laws, David Anderson, who said the government's anti-terror legal measures had failed to secure the "holy grail" of successful prosecutions of terror suspects. TPims were partly designed to give the police "added investigative opportunities", he said, but they had been no improvement on the control orders they replaced. TPims were not foolproof and were an "unhappy compromise", he added. He went on to say that the two-year limit on TPims meant there were "dangers" in releasing potentially dangerous people onto the street, but that the situation also concentrated minds on looking for a criminal justice solution. Labour committee member David Winnick said TPims were "somewhat alien to the concept of British justice". The home secretary can consider putting a TPim in place after an MI5 assessment of a suspect who can neither be charged nor deported and must "reasonably believe" he or she is involved in terrorist-related activities. Those placed under TPims "may well be as dangerous, as is said - I've no reason to doubt otherwise", Mr Winnick said. But he asked whether it would be "better resolved... to see if legislation could be amended so that such people could be tried". Mr Anderson replied: "I completely agree that the best solution in every case, if it can be done, is to put these people on trial. "You'll remember that of the ten people who have been subject to TPims since the system came in, four have been placed on trial and have been acquitted, acquitted by a jury. But, he said, "The secretary of state believes they are dangerous terrorists," adding that the courts which imposed the TPims has supported her in that belief. Labour has criticised the government for loosening curbs on terror suspects that were imposed by the previous government's control orders, after Mr Mohamed and a second man, also under a TPim, absconded. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper urged the government to re-introduce the power to relocate suspects to another part of the country. But Mr Anderson explained: "The added freedoms that go along with TPims might give you added investigative opportunities. "I think the thought was that if people were freer perhaps to associate with people that they'd known in a place with which they were familiar, it might be possible to pick up a little more information on what they are doing, and perhaps even reach the holy grail of being able to prosecute them for terrorism-related activity." The coalition had provided "considerable extra funding" for security services to step up surveillance on terror suspects, he added. But he concluded: "I don't think TPims have been very successful as investigative measures, any more than control orders have. "That's not to say that a complete blank has been drawn in relation to the gathering of evidence of possible utility for a criminal trial. "I would certainly accept that we haven't seen the fruits of that at this stage." </body>

      <title>Jowell's phone 'hacked 29 times'</title>
      <description>A phone belonging to former Labour minister Tessa Jowell was hacked 29 times in five months by the News of the World newspaper, the phone-hacking jury hears.</description>

      <body>A phone belonging to MP Tessa Jowell was hacked 29 times in five months for the News of the World, the jury in the phone-hacking trial has heard. Private investigator Glenn Mulcaire targeted the voicemail account of the former minister and her husband David Mills, the Old Bailey was told. The jury was told of messages between former NoW head of news Ian Edmondson and Mulcaire relating to the couple between 4 March and 25 July 2006. Mr Edmondson denies phone hacking. There was also evidence of multiple calls by Mulcaire to Ms Jowell's voicemails, and of one call from a News International office line to the account. The calls related to a period when Mr Mills had been accused of involvement in bribery linked to former Italian leader Silvio Berlusconi. Prosecutor Mark Bryant-Heron told the jury the NoW published a number of stories about the former Labour minister and her husband over the same period. One recording of a voicemail left for Ms Jowell, from a friend, was found at Mulcaire's home, in addition to invoices charging the paper for information relating to the couple. An email shown to the jury from Mulcaire to Mr Edmondson included the phrase, "substantial traffic both ways, also looks like she's selling up". The jury also heard that Kate Middleton and Boris Johnson's names were found on a hand-written page titled "Target Evaluation" at Mulcaire's home. The 18 names on the list also included Angelina Jolie's British stunt double, PR man Max Clifford, former England football manager Sven-Goran Eriksson, Tom Parker Bowles and Kerry Katona. The jury also heard that a Liverpool massage parlour receptionist had told Wayne Rooney to get out "before he was destroyed and his career was over". Newspapers writing about the player's "suggested use of prostitutes" had published untrue claims that Patricia Tierney had sex with him in a parlour in 2004, the court heard. But Ms Tierney said in a statement read to the court that she had warned the footballer to leave. She said: "It was alleged I had a sexual encounter with Wayne Rooney and he paid me for sex when I was working at a massage parlour. "I do recall Wayne Rooney visiting with a number of other males. Several days later he came on his own. "This time I pushed him into a room and told him to pull his hat down and get out before he was destroyed and his career was over." The court heard the story first appeared in the Sunday Mirror and was later followed up by The Sun, with several articles appearing in the daily tabloid. The jury was told that Angelina Jolie's British stunt double was also investigated after the actress began her relationship with Brad Pitt in 2005. Former Gladiators contestant Eunice Huthart was working on the action film Mr And Mrs Smith in Los Angeles in July 2005 when her mobile phone details and pin number appeared in Mulcaire's notes. The court also heard that Mulcaire hacked into the voicemail accounts of journalists from the Mail on Sunday, who were believed to be working on a story about Lord Prescott and an affair with his diary secretary Tracey Temple. Dennis Rice and Sebastian Hamilton had their mobile phones hacked by Mulcaire and their voicemail accounts were also hacked from a landline from the News International newsroom. The jury were told that 24 voicemails from Mr Rice's voicemail account were identified by him after recordings were found at Mulcaire's home. A further five voicemail recordings from Mr Hamilton's account were also identified. Mr Edmondson, 44, from Raynes Park, south west London, denies charges of conspiring to intercept communications. He is among eight defendants with links to the now-defunct News of the World. The trial continues. </body>

      <body>Parliament's watchdog has said it will not investigate allegations about Conservative MP Mark Pritchard's business dealings in Albania. The Daily Telegraph claimed the MP had offered to use his contacts to set up business deals for cash. But the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards decided there was "insufficient evidence" for an inquiry. Mr Pritchard denied any wrongdoing and referred himself to the watchdog after the "hurtful" claims were published. The MP for the Wrekin in Shropshire sits on the all-party group for Albania, and the Telegraph reported that he had told an undercover reporter posing as a businessman that he should invest £10m in a group of boutique hotels in the country. According to the terms described by the newspaper, this would have netted Mr Pritchard more than £300,000. But there was no suggestion the MP was willing to support deals in Parliament. He told the newspaper's undercover reporter that he did not lobby, and no money changed hands. </body>

      <body>Stormont's spending watchdog has said it has a "strong impression" that the awarding of the £11m contract for the rebuilding of Belfast's Lyric Theatre was "rigged and manipulated". However, the most senior civil servant in the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure has said he did not believe there was evidence to support the claim. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) report centres on the way in which the contract was awarded to the building firm Gilbert Ash. The report is a follow-up to an investigation by the NI Audit Office, however, it draws stronger conclusions. It focuses on the way in which the consultants running the bidding process adjusted the costs in the tenders made by five construction firms. The adjustment meant that Gilbert Ash, which had initially submitted the most expensive bid, came into line with the other firms. Gilbert Ash was then awarded the contract on the basis of a "quality ranking". Six months later, the firm made a £150,000 donation to the Lyric rebuilding fund. The PAC is strongly critical of the failure to retain the detailed documentation which shows how the bids were evaluated and adjusted. Public sector best practice states that those documents should have been retained for seven years, however, the consultants running the process destroyed them shortly after the contract was awarded. The PAC says that the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) and the Arts Council should have taken ownership of the documents or ensured that they were kept by the consultants. It considers that some of the adjustments made to the bids are "unexplained". It also states that conflict of interest arrangements were "not adequate" and that the Lyric fundraisers were "pursuing patronage" from Gilbert Ash at the same time as contract negotiations were continuing. It concludes that "taking all of the points in the round" it is "left with a very strong impression that the outcome of the tender process was both rigged and manipulated". The chair of the PAC, Michaela Boyle, explained how its members had come to conclude there had been "serious flaws" within the tendering process. "When the committee strongly said that we believed there had been manipulation around this process, that was in the absence of a strong documentation case coming before us," she said. "There was insufficient evidence to conclude that the best practice approach and value for money was applied, there was no scrutiny of the tender evaluation process by the department or its agents which is central procurement. "We recommended a number of different recommendations, but we're not a disciplinary committee so we can't recommend disciplinary action." An earlier report by the NI Audit Office (NIAO) had concluded that it was "unable to obtain assurance" that the evaluation of the bids applied best practice. It added that that there was no assurance that the adjustments made were "accurate and equitable". An internal audit conducted by DCAL, which is attached to the PAC report, concluded that it was "highly unlikely" that the sponsorship donation from Gilbert Ash influenced the awarding of the contract. Meanwhile, Gilbert Ash said it had "no control over the adjustment to tender costs made during the procurement process" - a practice it described "as standard in our industry to allow for like-for-like comparison of bids". Its statement added that the firm was "delighted to sponsor the Lyric Theatre, a fantastic arts venue and a major contributor to cultural life in Northern Ireland. "'We implemented a similar sponsorship partnership when working on the Waterfront Hall project and may follow similar practice in the future, should the opportunity arise." A Lyric Theatre spokesperson said The Lyric "completely rejects the wholly unevidenced claims made against the project". A senior source associated with the delivery of the Lyric project told the BBC that they believe the PAC conclusions were "deeply unfair" and that it was "untenable" to believe that all the parties involved had been colluding over the bid. DCAL Minister Carál Ní Chuilín said: "I welcome the recommendations in the report. We will consider the PAC report and provide a formal response in due course. "Significant changes have been made to the way in which the department manages its capital projects and many of the recommendations in the NIAO Report have already been implemented." </body>

      <body>A consultation on plans to create a network of Marine Protected Areas in the seas around Scotland is closing. The protected areas are intended to safeguard marine species and habitats, though some environmental groups said the plans did not go far enough. There have been 33 potential Marine Protected Areas identified around Scotland, ranging from Fetlar in Shetland to the mouth of the Clyde. The Scottish government will study the results of the 16-week consultation. Environmentalists said Scotland's seas had suffered from centuries of pollution, overfishing and damage to the seabed. The aim of the MPAs is to give fish, corals and sponges a chance to return to better health. In addition, the initiative will provide a guide for the development of the offshore renewable energy industry in Scotland. The proposed protected areas account for 12% of Scotland's seas. The Scottish government said that together the MPAs could play an important role in delivering a healthy, productive and biologically diverse marine environment for Scotland. Fishermen have traditionally been suspicious of the concept of MPAs but the Marine Conservation Society in Scotland said that the needs of the fishing industry, and those of conservation, were not so far apart. And, while the Scottish Fishermen's Federation appeared to cautiously support that sentiment the RSPB has been more critical of the plans. They said the proposed MPAs would do little to protect Scotland's struggling seabird population. </body>

      <title>Neonatal care decision overturned</title>
      <description>A decision to transfer specialist care for some of sickest babies in north Wales to England is overturned by the first minister - although some will still need to to be treated over the border.</description>

      <body>A decision to transfer specialist care for some of sickest and most premature babies in north Wales to England has been overturned by the first minister. Carwyn Jones said he accepted an independent review's suggestion that intensive care for babies be centralised at one north Wales site. But he said some babies needing the highest care level will need to go to Arrowe Park hospital on the Wirral. The original decision was taken due to lack of specialist staff. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) announced plans earlier this year to move specialist intensive care for babies across the border. But Mr Jones said the decision on Tuesday means the number of babies needing treatment in north west England each year would be "in the low tens". Mr Jones told AMs the best location, for the so called, sub-regional neonatal intensive care centre will be discussed by an independent panel that will report to him in the coming months. Currently two hospitals in north Wales provide specialist (level 3) neonatal care - Glan Clwyd hospital in Bodelwyddan and Wrexham Maelor hospital. Mr Jones said his decision would mean the vast majority of babies needing high level care could be treated in north Wales But he also said he was rejecting a proposal that would see all levels of neonatal services provided exclusively in north Wales. The first minister told assembly members that model could take 10 years to achieve and that the extra staff and costs associated with it meant it was not an option he was pursuing at this time. "This review supports the widely known principles that to deliver safe and sustainable services some centralisation of expertise must take place," he said. "I want to see the best services possible available to the people of Wales and I anticipate this review and subsequent actions will lead to the delivery of strong, sustainable services." BCUHB welcomed the review and Mr Jones's response to it. In a statement the health board said: "We are pleased that the decisions taken by the board to make sure that the most premature and seriously ill babies from north Wales are cared for by a specialist neonatal team have been supported. "The report is an important step forward and will help to ensure that we can continue to deliver most of the neonatal services locally. "We look forward to working with the independent panel to consider where these services will be located in the future," the statement concluded. Ministers launched the review after opposition to the health board's original plans. There were protests from parents, medical professionals and politicians. The health board estimated around 36 babies a year would be affected by its proposals. In the spring, the first minister asked the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) to review the decision to see if it would be possible to keep high level baby care at at least one north Wales hospital. That review has now recommended: The review warns that without investment, it believes the Welsh government's aspirations for neonatal care "will only be realised by increasing numbers of infants being transferred to England." Shadow Health Minister Darren Millar said the report "goes some way" towards ending "uncertainty" in communities across north Wales. "A cross-party campaign long warned that axing long-term neonatal care in the region was dangerous - a view supported by health professionals and clinicians. "Communities have been left in limbo for far too long and a site for a new centralised centre for neonatal care must now be identified as soon as possible." But Plaid Cymru North Wales AM Llyr Gruffydd accused Mr Jones of not wanting to take responsibility "on matters that directly affect the people of Wales". "The Labour government's plans mean that our most vulnerable babies will be sent to the NHS in England that the first minister has been so critical of. "Plaid Cymru has always made the case for the retention of these life-saving services in north Wales, and for north Wales to maintain this level of expertise." Liberal Democrat AM Aled Roberts said there needed to be more clarity on what would happen next, the timescale involved and he raised questions over governance arrangements between the health board and Arrowe Park hospital. "I think it's this confidence in the transparency of governance and practical arrangements going forward that is really missing from our relationship with Betsi Cadwaladr at the current time," he said. </body>

      <title>Lords quiz energy firms over fracking</title>
      <description>The four bosses of the energy firms hoping to develop shale gas and oil drilling give evidence to the Lords Economic Affairs Committee.</description>

      <body>The four bosses of companies hoping to develop shale gas and oil drilling in the UK have given evidence to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee. Francis Egan, chief executive of Cuadrilla, IGas Energy CEO Andrew Austin, Tom Crotty, director of INEO, and INEOS gas procurement manager Andrew Mackenzie were questioned on the scope for commercial shale gas extraction by peers on Tuesday. They were also asked which areas were most likely to produce shale gas, and when production might start. Andrew Austin was up first. He said they knew there was an awful lot of gas out there but what they needed to know was whether they could technically recover it and if it could be economical. Then it was the turn of Francis Egan of Cuadrilla. Quietly spoken and calm, you could sense his frustration that, as he put it, the difference between exploration and exploitation was not well understood. He repeatedly said they had not drilled shale at the Balcombe site in West Sussex and no hydraulic fracturing - fracking - had taken place either. Asked if he "could put his hand on his heart and say fracking is completely safe?", he said yes without any hesitation. He also said he could categorically say there was no correlation between fracking and cancers, which was one of the scare stories he'd heard. The point all four made was that the level of scrutiny on shale gas exploration was much higher than for tradition oil and gas and they thought the government needed to help sell the benefits - such as the potential to create anywhere between 25,000 and 100,000 jobs. They said there was the potential to create "another Aberdeen" - potentially in the North West of the country. After the hearing I spoke to the committee chair, Lord McGregor. He was at pains to point out they were not even half way through the inquiry process but said he thought the bosses had made a good case. Lord McGregor also cited the example of the US, where fracking has helped transform the economy and lower utility bills; the energy bosses gave no such assurances on utility bills. Mr Egan said he'd worked in oil and gas all his life and had "never seen an accurate oil price forecast" because the price was controlled by supply and demand. He also said if they didn't explore shale gas and oil opportunities everyone would have to pay higher prices for imported fuel eventually. The bosses estimate the UK's oil and gas is due to run out by about 2030, with Britain then being forced to import supplies from Russia or China at potentially much higher costs and with greater security risks. While the bosses calmly gave evidence to the committee, the No Fracking in Balcombe Society was among a group of campaigners delivering an open letter to the prime minister. They want the government to compensate communities for any fall in house prices or tourism resulting from fracking, and any environmental fallout that affects industries such as farming. The contrast between the way the two groups delivered their arguments brings into sharp focus the deep divisions on both sides of this debate - the need to keep the lights on weighed against the need to protect the environment. Despite the weeks of protests in Balcombe this summer, the energy bosses seemed optimistic the public mood would turn in their favour. Mr Egan said his firm could start drilling tomorrow if it had planning permission. This debate still has some way to go. Next up in front of the committee will be representatives of the Environment Agency and government ministers. And with energy prices under the spotlight like never before the government will be keen to explore all alternative forms of energy supplies. </body>

      <title>City's shipbuilding loss 'a tragedy'</title>
      <description>For a city with a proud maritime history, the news that Portsmouth will lose shipbuilding has been described as a "catastrophe".</description>

      <body>For a city with a proud maritime history, the news that Portsmouth will lose its shipbuilding industry has been described as a "catastrophe". About 900 job losses are expected at the BAE yard, which employs about 1,200 people. The site will stay open, with a focus on repairs and maintenance, but there is no prospect of new ships. For the south coast port, which considers itself the home of the Royal Navy, it is a big blow. The city's maritime links are clear for any visitor to see. Henry VIII's flagship Mary Rose, HMS Victory, from which Admiral Nelson commanded victory at the Battle of Trafalgar and the battleship HMS Warrior are proudly displayed in the city's dockyard. The Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers will be based at Portsmouth Naval Dockyard - which was under threat a few years ago. Losing shipbuilding will be felt far and wide across the Solent region. Many workers said they had been "forbidden" to speak to the media as they left the Portsmouth yard following the announcement. But one, who did not want to be named, described a "bad mood" among staff. "Basically there's about six months work left," he said. "It's not really unexpected, we knew it was coming." Another added: "It's a sad day for the loss of work in the South yet again. "[It's] a political decision for Scotland to have all the work and us have nothing." The mood in Portsmouth earlier matched those of the workers. Derek Brown, who started 40 years of work as a shipwright when he was 15, said: "For years it's been run down but it's unfortunate a lot of people will lose their jobs - people with mortgages and bills to pay. "When I first went in there was 22,000 people working in there. It was a job for life then but times change." Patricia Hawkins added: "Portsmouth will be a ghost town. We'll end up with a museum not a dockyard and what happens when we need ships to go to war again?" Portsmouth South MP Mike Hancock said the news was a "personal tragedy for everyone who's going into work in the yard today". He added: "And that's a personal tragedy for them and a catastrophe for the city of Portsmouth to lose so many highly-skilled jobs which will be virtually impossible to replace in that line. "I think it's a national disgrace that we're going put all their expertise and investment that's gone into the yard in Portsmouth at risk by closing it down and putting all your eggs into one basket." Ian Woodland, South East regional officer for the Unite union, said the news means skilled workers will be left on the "scrap heap". "[The] Tories are clueless about how to deal with BAE job losses in Portsmouth. Where will these people work?," he said. "There are no jobs for these workers. "BAE job losses in Portsmouth will affect [the] whole of Solent area. Many BAE employees [also] live in Southampton." Maureen Frost, executive director of Hampshire Chamber of Commerce, said it would be working with the city council to try and help those affected. "Losing the shipbuilding side is devastating news for the city," she added. "It's also about the supply chain and those small businesses that supply into BAE Systems so there's going to be a major impact. "It may not just be one person in one family, with the tradition of shipbuilding here sometimes it's the whole family involved." BAE launched a review of its defence work 18 months ago when it became apparent that future work, following the completion of the new aircraft carriers, was unlikely to sustain yards in Portsmouth as well as Govan and Scotstoun in Scotland. And it is Portsmouth that will make way. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Beginner's guide to PM's speech</title>
      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant? What has happened? Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning. Why the big deal about the speech? Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech. So what did Cameron say? Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech. What sorts of powers does the UK want back? The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK." Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders? The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK. So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU? David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market." What has been the reaction in the UK? Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement. Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party. The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts. What about the reaction around Europe? The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction. What about the reaction from business? A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".

      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle. The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011. As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign. Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury. Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011. Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development. Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. The MP for Leeds West was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament. A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader. As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest. One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress. Moving to defence from shadow Northern Ireland secretary in October 2013, the MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted having smoked cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip. The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011. One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the Cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. She supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leader of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. Chris Leslie has been appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the latest Labour frontbench reshuffle. The former Bradford councillor was elected MP for Shipley - a Tory stronghold in Yorkshire - in 1997. He held several junior positions in the former Labour government within the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He lost his Shipley seat in 2005, but re-entered Parliament in 2010 as MP for Nottingham East. He went on to serve as shadow financial secretary to the Treasury on Labour's front bench in the Commons. Mary Creagh has moved from shadow environment secretary to shadow transport secretary in October 2013. When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest. Maria Eagle moved in October 2013 to shadow environment secretary in a job swap with Mary Creagh. She is the sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. She held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player. Jim Murphy was moved - demoted in many people's eyes - in October 2013 from shadow defence secretary. He is a Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign. He has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football. Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008. In Holyrood, she held various posts, including minister for communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws. Before entering politics she was a lecturer in community education. The then 52-year-old took up her first full shadow cabinet role in October 2011. Jon Trickett takes over from the departing Tom Watson as deputy Labour party chair. Gordon Brown's former parliamentary aide, Mr Trickett previously attended shadow cabinet as a junior minister and became a full member as shadow Cabinet Office minister in Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle. The then 61-year-old MP for Hemsworth took over the role from Tessa Jowell. Michael Dugher became shadow Cabinet Office minister in October 2013 after attending the shadow cabinet as shadow minister without portfolio. Mr Dugher won the seat of Barnsley East at the 2010 General Election, after serving as chief political spokesman for the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Having joined the ranks of the Labour parliamentary party, he then became a parliamentary private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband. He is also currently vice-chairman of the Labour Party. Gloria De Piero was appointed shadow women and equalities minister in the October 2013 reshuffle. The former GMTV political editor was an political admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as party leader. She was elected as MP for Ashfield at the 2010 General Election and appointed to a junior role in the shadow Department for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport. Since October 2011, Ms De Piero has served as a junior shadow Home Office minister. Former BBC radio producer and special adviser who has risen quickly through the ranks. The then 40-year-old was elected in 2010 for Pontypridd, but previously stood unsuccessfully in the 2006 Blaenau Gwent by-election where he lost to independent Dai Davies. He supported Ed Miliband for the leadership and was given a role in his shadow team five months after entering the House, first as shadow Wales minister and then in the shadow Treasury team. This is his first shadow cabinet role. Moving from shadow minister for international development in October 2013, former charity worker and chief executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation, Mr Lewis held a string of junior ministerial posts in the Labour government after becoming an MP in 1997 at the age of 31. He started out as a parliamentary private secretary to then Trade Secretary Stephen Byers, before going on to be an education minister, Treasury minister, health minister and international development minister. Most recently, he was minister of state at the Foreign Office. His previous shadow cabinet role was as culture spokesman in which he was a vocal campaigner on phone hacking. The then 52-year-old was elected unopposed in a ballot for chief whip in 2010. A former local government minister, the Doncaster Central MP is responsible for maintaining discipline among Labour MPs in crucial Commons votes. Continues to lead her party in the Lords, having done the job, while in government, under Gordon Brown. She is also a spokesman on education, work and pensions, Northern Ireland and equality issues. Born in 1955, she started her political career as a special adviser to Neil - now Lord - Kinnock in the 1980s. A long-serving leader of Brighton and Hove Council, Lord Bassam was given a peerage in 1997 at the age of 44. The former local government official has continued as Labour's chief whip in the Lords, having done the job since before the 2010 general election. </body>

      <body>Lord Heseltine has come out fighting in favour of the HS2 high speed rail project. In a speech on Tuesday, the former Conservative Cabinet minister said supporting HS2 is as much an act of faith as a reliance on figures, and the UK "must consider carefully the cost of not acting" over HS2. Meanwhile the transport select committee has summoned Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin to appear later this month to question him over a contested report predicting the HS2 rail project could benefit the UK by £15bn a year. Lord Heseltine said: "I've been in this business since the seventies and if I had said that the east end of London was going to get the sort of developments like it did, like an airport, like Canary Wharf, like Excel, or that HS1 would come through and regenerate Stratford and win the Olympics, people would have locked me up." Professor Henry Overman, a former member of the HS2 analytical challenge panel, believes "on the balance of the evidence we've got available to us, HS2 remains not particularly good value for money compared to other transport projects."

      <description>David Cameron's challenge in India</description>

      <body>Earlier this year, commuters in Delhi and other Indian cities were being offered attractive scenes of British life on street-side hoardings, buses and taxis - part of a global UK campaign to promote "Great Britain". The ads were slickly produced, but they looked oddly incongruous against the fierce contrasts of modern India - as if those behind this "Great" campaign weren't sure whom they were talking to here, or about what. Something similar has been going wrong in the UK's relations with India. Spearheaded by a clearly enthusiastic David Cameron, the package looks good on the surface. But from India's point of view, it doesn't do as advertised when you open it - largely because of a perception the UK is closing its doors to outsiders. A perception that is wrong, insist British diplomats. But as Mr Cameron responds to domestic pressures to cut immigration, he is facing increasing blowback abroad. And in a striking reversal of roles, it's left him looking like a slightly desperate suitor in Indian eyes, trying to persuade Britain's old colony to give him another chance. His third visit since taking office is proof, say UK officials, of his long-term commitment to India. But the papers here have pointedly noted their prime minister hasn't been to see him in the UK once. And privately, Indian officials are surprised Mr Cameron is back again - especially as the government may be on its last legs before elections in a few months time. "There will be no heavy-duty stuff on the agenda," said one senior official. "But we see the visit as a gesture of friendship to smooth over the bitterness that has crept in." This bad flavour is almost all to do with immigration. The number of Indian students going to the UK has tumbled by a quarter in the last year, with Britain's "stifling visa regime" getting the blame. "Good education has always been a British selling point," rues an Indian businessman whose son failed to get a UK visa. "Now we have to go elsewhere." UK officials say such stories are un-representative - and that 80% of Indian students who apply for visas get them. "The door is open to the best and brightest," says a senior diplomat, but admits, "there are misperceptions about our policies". But even when the UK recently abandoned its most controversial idea of demanding a £3,000 deposit or bond from Indians seeking a visa it got little credit. Perceptions won't shift, says Adrian Mutton of Delhi-based consultancy Sannam S4, unless Britain changes its immigration rhetoric. Its slogan - "we welcome the brightest and the best" - he argues, excludes many otherwise good students who "are still honest visa applicants, willing to invest tens of thousands into the UK via fees and living costs". Meanwhile, other Western countries with skills gaps are stepping up efforts to attract Indian students. There are knock-on effects. While Indian companies have bought up large tracts of British industry, when it comes to winning contracts here, UK companies often lose out. Yet, India still has deeper ties with Britain than with any other country outside South Asia. India wants to like the UK. But it wants to see more than the prime minister liking India back. </body>

      <title>Is Labour right behind HS2?</title>
      <description>Is time running out for Labour on HS2?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24920028</url>

      <body>"Yes, but..." If you needed two words to describe what was becoming Labour's position on the planned new north-south high speed rail line, HS2, they would be the two I would opt for. Led by shadow chancellor Ed Balls, Labour began to sound increasingly sceptical about an idea it had originally signed off in government. It wasn't cancelling the train, but there were problems. There were, if you like, leaves on the line. More on those leaves in a moment. There would be, Labour repeatedly told us, "no blank cheque" for the project. Mr Balls argued that the costs of the project had spiralled and any responsible shadow chancellor had to be responsible with the public finances. Many at Westminster mused that the price tag for HS2, £50bn, was a tantalising pot of money for a shadow chancellor to consider spending elsewhere and his scepticism was a vehicle for trying to convince people that he, and Labour, could be trusted with the country's money. It was no surprise that the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats ridiculed the apparent equivocation and prevarication. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was "miserable," "pathetic" and "absolutely beggared belief." But what was far more tricky for Labour was what the party's own big noises in the north of England had to say. These are people who aren't big names outside their own cities. But they run some of England's biggest places outside London: Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham, Sheffield and Newcastle. With Labour out of power at Westminster, they hold some of the most powerful offices of government, albeit local government, held by any Labour figures in the country. After Labour's reshuffle, they wrote to the new shadow transport secretary, Mary Creagh, to express their exacerbation at what they called "a significant weakening of the party's commitment to the project". They warned, rather strikingly, of a "protracted public conflict between the party leadership and the Labour led core cities" if this wasn't resolved. A matter of days later, Ed Balls spoke at the CBI conference. My colleague James Landale blogged then on what he spotted as a possible change of tone from Labour, to sound a little more positive. And now back to those leaves on the line I was referring to. In an interview with Ed Balls' regional newspaper, the Yorkshire Post, the former Shadow Transport Secretary, Maria Eagle, now in the environment brief, appears to have a little dig at her shadow cabinet colleague. "It's all back on track... There's been some leaves on the line, I think, that Ed Miliband has cleared away. Our position now is very clear," she told the newspaper. And she said she understood why some had demanded greater clarity from Labour's leadership on HS2: "I understand the concerns and why they feel the need to express their views, and I think our position is now very clear. Ed Miliband has made it very clear. And it's pretty much what I was saying when I was doing the job. We're going to deliver this north-south railway line." Next March is likely to be the moment when the legislation needed to make HS2 happen, known as a hybrid bill, reaches a crucial stage in the Commons. Labour sources suggest that even then won't necessarily have to be the moment the party definitively commits one way or another. But it's unlikely too much equivocation and prevarication will be sustainable either. </body>

      <title>Has government become too aggressive with outsourcers?</title>
      <description>How much money do government contractors make?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24909883</url>

      <body>Possibly the most shocking disclosure in the National Audit Office's two reviews of how private sector companies deliver public services is how little financial information the NAO can actually demand to scrutinise. In order to assess the important question of whether the big contractors, Serco, G4S, Atos and Capita, are making excessive profits from their £4bn of annual business with the public sector, the government's spending watchdog had to rely to a great extent on information volunteered to them by the four. Which seems something of a lacuna, given that a huge and rising proportion of our public services are delivered by the private sector. According to the NAO, contracting out, to the likes of Serco, G4S, Atos and Capita, accounts for "around half of the £187bn that the public sector spends on goods and services each year". Or to put it another way, contracting out represents around 15% of all public spending and 5% of UK GDP. Private sector delivery of public services is therefore hugely important to the effectiveness of the functioning of the state and to the productivity of the economy. Yet it is only written in to some contracts that they are "open book", that the client (that's you by the way, the taxpayer) has a formal right to know how much money the private company is actually making from a particular contract. So what did the NAO actually learn about the profitability of the big four outsourcing companies from the information they supplied? Well the big four say that in 2012 their respective operating margins - the profits they typically make as a percentage of sales - on government contracts were lower than the operating margin they earn on average on all contracts. So on that basis, if the numbers are reliable, it would be hard to argue that the government is being ripped off. But there are three qualifications to make: 1. They are all making an operating margin on government work in the ballpark of 5%, with Capita and Serco apparently generating a smidge more than Atos and G4S. But is there anything magical and appropriate about that 5% number? Now the NAO points out that the net margin for these companies for all their work - for public-sector and private-sector work - is a bit less than the average for FTSE 100 companies. But that may not be a useful comparison. Given the long term nature of the public-sector contracts, and that once they are won they are frequently rolled over and extended, would it be reasonable for the profit margin to be even less? The NAO doesn't seem to have a view on this. 2. There is enormous variation in the profitability of different contracts, which calls into question whether the 5% average return is meaningful. The gross profit margin (the profit before allocating overheads) for Atos on contracts varies between 3% and 22%, the range is 6-18% for Capita, it's 0-32% for G4S, and 4-13% for Serco. Again an important question is begged, namely why there is such variation in the profitability of contracts both for individual companies and between companies? Does this variation reflect the different degrees of risk for the contractor in each contract - which would be a reassuring explanation? Or does it imply that there is great variation in the competence of public sector negotiators - which would warm the cockles rather less? Again there is no definitive answer from the NAO. 3. The NAO notes that from 1 January 2006 to 30 September 2013, the value of these businesses on the stock market has risen much more than the value of FTSE 100 companies in general. In that period, the FTSE 100 index increased 26%, whereas Capita's share price rose 141% and G4S's 94%. That would suggest investors aren't remotely worried that the profitability of government contracts is too slim. Quite the reverse. It implies that the reliability of the revenues from these contracts is what matters, and that therefore the profit margins are quite satisfactory. But, and this is quite important, the story of the relationship between the private-sector providers and the government is - ahem - evolving. Since the 2010 general election, the Cabinet Office has aggressively tried to exercise greater central control over the awarding of outsourcing contracts. In the process, it has obtain substantial refunds on older deals and seems to be securing better value for money on new transactions. More recently the Ministry of Justice has duffed up Serco and G4S, by calling in the Serious Fraud Office to investigate alleged overcharging for electronic tagging of criminals. Or to put it another way, the perceived balance between risk and reward on these outsourced deals is changing, to the detriment of the private sector businesses. There have been big management changes at Serco and G4S, and their share prices have both fallen by around a sixth since May. So probably the most interesting conclusion by the NAO is the one that goes against the grain of typical political and public discourse about private sector providers. The NAO warns the Cabinet Office that there is a limit to the financial squeeze it can put on the likes of the big four, and that it may not be too long before there will be a loss of "innovation and investment" which "could pose a risk to value for money in the longer term". The watchdog takes seriously the private sector providers when they say they may choose not to bid for future contracts in certain public services. And that could be a problem, because - with so much outsourced since the 1980s - it is not obvious that the public sector retains the competence and skills to take back some of these services. Or to return to where I started, given that public and private sectors are now so intimately and intricately combined, it may not be unreasonable for the taxpayer as employer to have much clearer sight of how much profit the contractor is earning. </body>

      <title>Positive signs despite breakdown of Iran nuclear talks</title>
      <description>Iran talks move from success to failure, but hope remains</description>

      <body>At the end of last week, with excitement mounting, influential foreign ministers rushed post-haste to Geneva. All the signs were that an important interim deal would be signed between Iran and the P5+1 - the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, along with Germany. However, at the last moment somebody applied the brakes. No deal could be reached. There was only agreement to meet again, at a lower level, on 20 November. Amidst the rapid euphoria and almost instantaneous gloom of the news cycle, the Iran nuclear talks moved from success to failure in the blink of an eye. The setback - if that is really what it was - serves, though, as a reality check: underscoring both the nature of the deal that was being discussed and the raft of problems militating against progress. So who cried foul? The finger-pointing has highlighted two possible culprits: France, and the Iranians themselves. Few details of the talks have been revealed - itself probably a good thing if there is to be any agreement. The French, it seems, baulked at the last moment. Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius was concerned about two issues: continued construction of Iran's heavy-water reactor at Arak that might eventually give it a plutonium route to a bomb, and the fate of the stock of 20%-enriched uranium that Tehran has already accumulated. France has generally taken a tough line with Tehran. And many commentators have also pointed to the developing commercial ties - especially in the military sector - between Paris and the Gulf. Washington's Gulf Arab allies are as alarmed as Israel at the possibility of what they might see as a poor or weak deal with Tehran, so - some of the pundits suggest - France is seeking to mark out its position from the other Western players. That said, France's views on Iran's nuclear programme have been consistent, its approach to these talks nicely summed up by the comment from Mr Fabius himself suggesting that Paris was "neither isolated nor simply following along" in the negotiations. More generally - and not surprisingly - there has been a denial that the Western camp has been divided, not least from the US Secretary of State John Kerry himself. Speaking in the United Arab Emirates on Monday, Mr Kerry noted that France was as much on board as the other Western players. It was Iran, he said, that "couldn't take it at that particular moment". Mark Hibbs, a Berlin-based nuclear expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, says that in his view that might be a diplomatic way of minimising the tensions in the Western camp. However, he believes the outcome in Geneva was by no means a fiasco. Not only the French, but others in the Western camp, were uneasy at the sudden breakneck pace of the talks, Mr Hibbs says. As he puts it: "Some of the Europeans were concerned that Washington was moving forward at a pace with which they were not comfortable." In his view, the additional 10 days of reflection before the various parties meet again could be very helpful. Mr Hibbs also argues that the separate agreement between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) just announced in Tehran and confirmed in Vienna - on a framework through which to tackle concerns about Iran's past nuclear activities - is also a positive sign. If there is to be any final agreement between Iran and the P5+1, then not only must the uncertainties of the past be clarified, but a new spirit of co-operation must be established between Iran and the UN's nuclear watchdog. The new deal identifies five specific areas where progress is to be made over the next three months - so there is a built-in mechanism to determine if Iran is playing ball. The delay in the Geneva talks on reaching an interim deal - one that will build confidence and put "more time on the clock" in Secretary Kerry's words - is thus in Mr Hibbs' view no disaster. "We should all remember that we are currently in a place in negotiations with Tehran where we have never been before!" he notes. The mood music, Mr Hibbs clearly believes, should still be seen as positive. </body>

      <body>At least 10,000 people are feared dead and thousands of survivors desperately require aid in the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan swept across the country on Friday. The Disasters Emergency Committee - a group of 14 UK aid organisations - has launched an appeal to help the victims. What are the UK government and aid agencies doing to help? The first British government aid flight has landed at Cebu airport in the Philippines. The government said it would match donations to the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal pound for pound up to £5m. A 12-strong team of volunteer surgeons, doctors and paramedics is being sent from the UK's International Emergency Trauma Register. David Cameron has pledged an extra £4m in aid, bringing the UK's total contribution since the disaster struck to £10m. He announced that Royal Navy warship HMS Daring - deployed near Singapore - would be heading towards the disaster to arrive within days. The Type 45 destroyer is taking with it an onboard Lynx helicopter, engineering and first aid expertise, and equipment to turn seawater into drinking water. At least one of the RAF's Boeing C-17 transport aircraft will be used to move humanitarian aid and large equipment. The additional support will provide aid flights to the badly-hit area of Cebu, in the eastern Philippines, to deliver cutting equipment, 4x4 vehicles and forklift trucks to help to reopen roads and runways. Before Monday night's announcement, the Department for International Development had already released £5m to organisations working in the Philippines to provide assistance including access to clean water. The UK is donating shelter materials, such as plastic sheeting, and household items such as kitchen sets and blankets from the UK's stockpile of humanitarian items in Dubai - worth a further £600,000. The government has sent three British humanitarian advisers, who arrived in the Philippines on Saturday. They are working with the agencies on the ground and the government of the Philippines to assess the scale of the need and advise on what the UK can do to help. They are also working to ensure the UK is "prioritising the protection of vulnerable women and children". NHS experts have also been flown with water purification kits and shelter to the city of Tacloban in Leyte province, which was at the centre of the storm. The government said its contribution would help to get food, aid and shelter to a total of 800,000 people. The British Red Cross already had workers in the Philippines helping victims of the earthquake which struck the Bohol area last month. They have been redirected to help in the aftermath of the typhoon. Another team has flown out to the Philippines from the UK. The organisation has contributed £100,000 to the relief effort and is appealing for more donations from the public. It has sent a team to the Philippines capital, Manila, which is being deployed to Cebu, where the British Red Cross has a distribution hub. Already 280 cubic metres of relief materials have been sent to the area from Malaysia, including 10,000 tarpaulins, 20,000 jerry cans and 47,000 hygiene kits. More supplies were due in Cebu from a Red Cross warehouse in Dubai on Tuesday. Meanwhile, workers at the British Red Cross's warehouse in Bristol have been spending Tuesday loading supplies such as computers, printers, forklift trucks, vehicles, as well as water purification and sanitation kits, tents and heavy duty kit, to be flown out from Stansted airport on Thursday. A shelter expert will also be on the flight. A spokeswoman said: "It's going to be a long operation. We're setting up for months and years." The charity says the bulk of its work will be in providing emergency supplies of water, sanitation and shelter. It says communities also need to have power and communications restored and roads need to be cleared so that aid can get through. An aid shipment of water and sanitation equipment from the UK is expected to be dispatched within the next 48 hours. Oxfam will also work on helping people, including those who rely on farming and fishing to make a living, to get back on their feet. Spokesman Graham Mackay said: "Our main concern is getting relief to the worst affected areas. Because communications are down the real extent of this horrific disaster is still not known." Save the Children has provisions stockpiled in a warehouse in Dubai. It is expecting to fly 40 tonnes of medical equipment, materials to build shelters, health and sanitation equipment to the disaster area on Wednesday morning, along with logistics experts and technicians to help with building. It also has assessment teams in the Philippines gathering information on the situation there and on what work needs to be done. The charity will focus particularly on child protection, setting up child-friendly spaces, where children can play and attempting to deliver books so they can continue some form of learning since many schools have been destroyed. With many children separated from their families, it hopes to help them feel safer and less frightened on their own. It estimates the cost of its efforts will be $30m (£18.7m). Care International UK has a small team already on the ground in the coastal province of Leyte which has been badly affected. Two shelter experts flew out from the UK on Friday and are assessing what needs to be done. A spokeswoman said the charity hoped to help 30,000 families in the province - an estimated 150,000 people - by providing shelter, water and food, which it says are the most immediate needs. Its staff are sourcing supplies in the Philippines capital Manila including rice, cooking utensils and tarpaulins for shelter. Cafod - one of the 14 major charities involved in the DEC appeal - is already working with local partners on the ground in the worst hit areas of the Philippines. It has been focusing its response on people's immediate requirements, helping to provide food, water, clothes, blankets and other essential household items. Like other charities, the organisation had already been on the ground bringing food and shelter to people who lost their homes in the earthquake on the island of Bohol last month. Cafod says that the typhoon has added to the destruction and has made it more difficult to deliver aid. However, it adds it has scaled up its response and is currently moving tarpaulins to Cebu City to provide 8,000 families with shelter. Teams are also travelling to the areas hardest hit to determine exactly what people need in the coming days. Cafod has pledged an initial £50,000 in response to the crisis. Cornwall-based international disaster relief charity ShelterBox already had response teams and aid on the ground at Bohol in the Philippines in the aftermath of last month's earthquake. More teams have arrived in Manila since, working closely with other aid agencies to make plans for reaching the worst-affected areas. To supplement stocks already distributed from the former US air base at Clark on Luzon island, ShelterBox has major consignments arriving in two plane-loads from Dubai. It can also call on stock from Melbourne and near Kuala Lumpur. Each box contains a durable tent for an extended family, and essential items including blankets, cooking utensils, water purification, solar lighting, a tool kit, even activity sets and teddies for children. ShelterBox has already committed aid for up to 4,000 families to the Philippines. Mark Curnow, of ShelterBox, said: "Everyday that goes past we realise more and more the real significance of this disaster and the areas of devastation become more apparent". </body>

      <title>Christie - the Republicans' best shot at the White House</title>
      <description>Mark Mardell on New Jersey's governor White House chances</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24894345</url>

      <body>This week's Time magazine front cover with Chris Christie, governor of New Jersey, is titled "The elephant in the room". He told ABC: "If I'm bothered by jokes about my weight, it's time for me to curl up into the foetal position and go home, OK?" "So let's get the fat jokes out of the way first. Christie is a big figure, a heavy hitter and a weighty presence," his campaign manager and friend of 20 years Bill Palatucci tells me. "It certainly doesn't bother anyone in New Jersey, we all have our struggles. He's got a bit of a weight problem, but it doesn't hold him down whatsoever." What is important is the big guy's next trick, which requires all the poise of a tightrope walker, balancing on the taut wire stretching between popular appeal and conservative distaste. Make no mistake - he could be, puns aside, a huge player. He could be the Republicans' best stab at the White House in 2016, potentially transforming his party in the process. He has, as far as I can see, a unique appeal in American politics, reaching parts that Hillary Clinton can't. Rush Limbaugh, the hyper-conservative, Tea Party-adored doyen of right-wing talk show hosts, says it tells you all you need to know that Democrats love Christie, that he is a creation of the liberal media. He has a point, although not the one he thinks he is making. Christie's importance is precisely because a third of self-identified Democrats who voted in New Jersey vote for him. It is because liberals in the Washington media establishment can vaguely imagine holding their ideological noses and voting for him. Hurricane Sandy defined Chris Christie - he toured his smashed-up state, throwing his big arms around the newly homeless. He also gripped the hand of President Obama, praising him for helping the rescue operation with government money - this, just days before last year's election. It disgusted some conservatives. He looked like a man more concerned about helping people than remaining pure to a cause. He talks of getting the job done and working together at a time Washington can do neither, mainly because of the shenanigans of his own party. But a lot of Americans like this sort of talk - you might even remember the senator who said there was not a liberal America, or a conservative America but the United States of America. It can be the key to the White House. There are two main ways to win elections (they are not mutually exclusive). One, you can motivate and organise and drag out all the people who, in theory, like your party and should be voting for you. This is what Obama did in 2008 and 2012. Second, you can hoover up the swing voters, the people in the centre and some of those who often vote for the other party. It is a typical mistake of both politicians and journalists to talk in shorthand implying everyone is born with a party label around their necks. It is not true. Even in the extraordinarily partisan world of US politics there are plenty of people who change from one election to another or split the ticket, voting say one way for the Senate, the other for the president. Here's the thing - although the Democrat nomination is Hillary Clinton's for the taking, she can't necessarily pull off this trick. Many Republicans heartily dislike the Clintons, and her appeal to the centre is uncertain. New Jersey exit polls indicated voters preferred Hillary Clinton by 49% to Christie's 43%. That's not bad in a long-time Democrat state. But to get a shot at the general election, Christie has to win his own party's nomination first. That will be really hard - in 2012, the Republican candidates tried to outdo each other by appealing to the right, and as a result Mitt Romney found himself trapped inside an ideological bubble of his own design, unable to appeal to his natural constituency of business-minded moderates. Christie may be pugnacious on low taxation and the unions, but he has already evoked conservatives' ire. He will have trouble convincing them he's the real deal. On the Sunday shows, he tried a combination of "Let's work together" and "I'm just the governor of New Jersey", but I'd expect him now to trim to the right to an extent. I asked his old friend Bill Palatucci what he made of the Tea Party criticisms. He said: "There are lots of elements of the Tea Party. The governor has great, great support in New Jersey for cutting taxes and making government smaller. Our spending in New Jersey in 2014 is less than in 2008. "I think the Tea Party is about freedom and smaller government and the governor is about the same things." So he can appeal to conservatives? I ask. "Absolutely. The governor is very much a conservative, very much pro-life, against gay marriage, worked very hard to get Mitt Romney elected. "His accomplishments on fiscal issues when the state was on the brink of bankruptcy, turning that around - that's a record many conservatives like." But Christie has ducked and weaved along the centre line. He's long been anti-abortion, but hasn't made a big deal of it; he's opposed gay marriage but recently ordered New Jersey courts to drop an appeal against it; and he's banned conversion therapy for gay kids in New Jersey. So I ask - will he stand for president? Bill Palatucci laughs long and hard. "We'll wait and see," he says. "He's just got re-elected so it's important to get to the job of the second term, a good second term." That indeed may be critical - New Jersey's economy is not in a great way. But for the next three years, Christie will be on the tightrope - how he sways and if he falls will be vitally important for his party and the country. </body>

      <title>NHS shake-up proposes two-tier A&amp;E</title>
      <description>A two-tier A&amp;E system in England should be created as part of an overhaul of services, NHS chiefs are proposing.</description>

      <body>A two-tier AandE system in England should be created as part of an overhaul of services, NHS chiefs say. The review by NHS England suggested the biggest 40 to 70 units - specialising in heart attacks, strokes and trauma - be called major emergency centres. It would leave the remaining 70 to 100 AandEs - known as emergency centres - to deal with less serious conditions. It also suggested changes to the way ambulance crews and the new 111 phone service work to "decongest" AandEs. Greater co-ordination between community services, such as GPs and pharmacists, would also help, it said. The measures have been put forward in response to the growing pressures on accident and emergency departments. Patient numbers have risen by 50% in the past decade and last winter the problems got so severe that the NHS missed its four-hour waiting time target. Extra money has been set aside to help the NHS through this winter and the next one. But this review aims to set out the long-term vision for the service. Many of the proposals are already in operation somewhere and in essence the review is calling for this to be formalised across the system. For example, there are already a number of AandE units that act as major centres in everything but name. But by setting a target of having between 40 and 70 major emergency centres it means this will have to be extended across the health service. NHS medical director Prof Sir Bruce Keogh, who led the review, said: "AandE is creaking at the seams. It is not broken, but it is struggling. "We need to change the way we work. But what we are suggesting here already exists in places, we are just trying to formalise it so it is available for everyone." The review said there also needed to be further changes to the system if pressure was going to be relieved. About 40% of people who attend AandE do not need treating there. What is more, the problems developed by a fifth of patients who are eventually admitted to hospital with emergency conditions could have been avoided with better and earlier treatment in the community. The review said key to tackling these problems was ensuring patients got access to the services that were best suited to them first time. To achieve this, 111, which has been beset by problems since it was launched in April to replace NHS Direct, will need to be much more responsive, giving patients direct phone access to doctors, nurses and other health professionals. Ambulance crews will need to treat more patients at the scene to reduce the number of patients transferred to hospital. Meanwhile, there needs to be greater co-ordination between GPs, pharmacists and the network of minor injury clinics and walk-in centres to give patients 24/7 access to care outside of hospital. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said Labour welcomed Sir Bruce's report but deplored "the government's attempt to avoid presenting it to Parliament and abdicate all responsibility for the crisis in AandE". "Ministers said this report would have lessons for the immediate winter, as well as the longer term," he added. "But they are failing to act and their response remains 'crisis, what crisis'? They are forcing AandEs to go into winter with too few nurses, doctors and beds." He said the prime minister had "made it harder to get a GP appointment, closed NHS walk-in centres and scrapped NHS Direct, leaving people with no alternative but to go to AandE". Patients Association chief executive Katherine Murphy said the review had presented a "promising vision". "At present there is genuine confusion amongst some patients, who then opt for AandE as a safe default option," she added. College of Emergency Medicine president Dr Clifford Mann welcomed the proposals, although he said NHS chiefs would need to be careful the reorganisation of AandEs did not lead to "detrimental" increased journey times. He also said: "Any plan to provide emergency care must be based upon an adequate number of appropriately skilled clinicians and on this matter the review is disappointingly silent." The changes will now go out to consultation and the review team will spend the next six months looking at the cost and staffing implications before producing another report in the spring. It is likely to take three to five years before the overhaul is completed. </body>

      <title>'Flu watch' coming to UK schools</title>
      <description>Scientists are to begin collecting data on flu outbreaks from UK schools this winter to better understand its spread.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24914059</url>

      <body>Scientists are to begin collecting data on flu outbreaks from UK schools this winter to better understand its spread. The Flusurvey surveillance project is in its fifth year, but for the first time classrooms are being asked to take part. It coincides with the NHS beginning to roll out childhood flu vaccinations. In time, the nasal spray vaccine will be available for children aged 16 and under. This flu season it is being offered to all children aged two and three, as well as children of any age with long-term health conditions such as diabetes. In Scotland and seven pilot areas in England, children aged four to 11 will also be eligible for it this year. In order to help control and lower the impact of flu, the Flusurvey researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine want to understand what role children play in catching and spreading the disease. In 2012-13, the highest rates of infection were reported in the under-18 age group. Head of the project Dr Alma Adler said: "Last year we found that taking public transport does not increase your risk of catching flu and we discovered that 'man flu' didn't really exist - in fact women were slightly more likely to report feeling worse when they have flu than men. "This year we're keen to find out more about children because they are the 'key spreaders' of flu." The Flusurvey team will be working with the British Science Association to link up with schools for the 2013-14 flu season to monitor the impact of the virus. They will also be looking to see what role exercise and diet might play in keeping flu at bay. Public Health England compiles its own weekly update on flu incidence rates. Currently, there is no sign that the flu season has begun - GP consultant rates for flu-like illnesses have so far remained low throughout the UK. Figures suggest a fifth of eligible two and three-year-olds have received their flu vaccine. A third of eligible "at risk" adults and children, such as those with asthma, have been immunised, as have half of people in the over-65 age group. A new vaccine is needed each year to protect against the flu viruses expected to be in circulation that winter and to boost the immune response. Although influenza activity in the UK rose to only low levels in the 2012-13 season, activity was prolonged and reached levels higher than those seen in 2011-12. If you have flu, you generally start to feel ill within a few days of being infected. Flu causes a sudden high temperature, headache, general aches and pains, tiredness and a sore throat. The symptoms are far more severe than with a common cold. </body>

      <body>A television appeal for donations has been made by a group of leading UK aid charities following the devastating Philippines typhoon. Broadcaster Kirsty Young presented the short film on the BBC on behalf of the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC). The DEC earlier said it was overwhelmed by the £1.5m raised in the first 15 hours after its plea for contributions. The first British government aid flight has now landed at Cebu airport in the Philippines. A 12-strong UK medical team is also being sent to the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan struck on Friday. Buckingham Palace said the Queen had made a personal donation and sent a message expressing her "heartfelt condolences" to those affected by the typhoon. It is feared the storm has killed thousands of people and displaced hundreds of thousands more. DEC chief executive Saleh Saeed described the amount already raised as "quite staggering". He said: "It is clear the British public has been moved by the stories we are hearing from the Philippines - people struggling to survive with no food, water or shelter. "The more money we raise, the more our member agencies can do on the ground to help people rebuild their lives." Mr Saeed said the relief effort was being severely hampered because the typhoon had made roads impassable and closed airports. DEC, a group of 14 UK aid organisations, said it was already responding but there was still a desperate need for water, food and emergency shelter. It comprises the charities Action Aid, Age International, British Red Cross, Cafod, Care International, Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Islamic Relief, Merlin, Oxfam, Plan UK, Save the Children, Tearfund and World Vision. The government said it would match donations to the appeal pound for pound up to £5m. Prime Minister David Cameron said: "We've all seen the appalling devastation wrought by Typhoon Haiyan, with heart-breaking scenes played across our TV screens. "Today's Disasters Emergency Committee appeal launch is a vital step to ensure aid agencies can provide essential relief to those most affected by this unprecedented disaster." He added: "I am proud that the British public have always shown an unfailing generosity for helping those in need and I know their response to this appeal will be no different." The UK medical team will include three emergency physicians, two orthopaedic surgeons, one plastic surgeon, two accident and emergency nurses, one theatre nurse, two anaesthetists and one specialist physiotherapist. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: "The Philippines government has asked Britain for urgent medical assistance and I have now activated the UK's International Emergency Trauma Register. "We are mobilising a 12-strong team of volunteer surgeons, doctors and paramedics who are expert at operating in emergency situations such as this." The team will be led by professor of international emergency medicine Anthony Redmond, of Manchester University. He said two public health specialists had already been sent to the capital Manila to assess the situation. There was the option to call in more medical volunteers from the register if necessary, he added. Justin Forsyth, chief executive of Save the Children, said there was a danger that if enough aid were not delivered quickly pregnant women and children would miss out. "All the organisations - Save the Children, Oxfam, all the others, the United Nations - are there ready to help," he said. "We need to land the planes, we need to offload them and then we need to get aid to people." On Monday night, Mr Cameron said the UK was increasing emergency aid to the country by another £4m to £10m. He announced that HMS Daring, a Type-45 destroyer deployed near Singapore, would arrive at the disaster area within days. At least one RAF Boeing C-17 transport aircraft would be used to move humanitarian aid and large equipment, Mr Cameron added. The government said its contribution would help to get food, aid and shelter to a total of 800,000 people. The UN has launched an appeal for $301m (£190m) to help relief efforts in typhoon-hit areas of the country. </body>

      <title>New mums 'paid' to breastfeed</title>
      <description>New mothers are to be offered up to £200 in shopping vouchers to encourage them to breastfeed their babies under a pilot scheme being launched.</description>

      <body>New mothers are to be offered up to £200 in shopping vouchers to encourage them to breastfeed their babies. The pilot scheme is being targeted at deprived areas of South Yorkshire and Derbyshire and funded through a collaboration between government and the medical research sector. A third area is expected soon with the plan to trial it on 130 women who have babies from now until March. If successful, a nationwide pilot could be rolled out in England next year. The use of financial incentives is not new in the NHS. It has been tried before to encourage people to quit smoking as well as lose weight. But this is the first time it has been tried on such a scale for breastfeeding. Under the scheme mothers from specific parts of Sheffield and Chesterfield will be offered the vouchers, which they can then use in supermarkets and high street shops. The areas have been chosen because they have such low breastfeeding rates. On average just one in four mothers are breastfeeding by the six- to eight-week mark compared with a national average of 55%. To qualify for the full £200 of rewards, the women will have to breastfeed until six months. However, it will be frontloaded - enabling those taking part to get £120 for breastfeeding for the first six weeks. Midwives and health visitors will be asked to verify whether the women are breastfeeding. The team behind the project said breastfeeding was a cause of health inequalities, pointing to research that showed it helped prevent health problems such as upset stomachs and chest infections as well as leading to better educational attainment. Dr Clare Relton, the Sheffield University expert leading the project, said she hoped the financial incentives would create a culture where breastfeeding was seen as the norm. "It is a way of acknowledging both the value of breastfeeding to babies, mothers and society," she added. But Janet Fyle, of the Royal College of Midwives, questioned the initiative: "The motive for breastfeeding cannot be rooted by offering financial reward. It has to be something that a mother wants to do in the interest of the health and well-being of her child." She said the answer lay in making sure there were enough staff available to provide comprehensive support to new mothers after birth. </body>

      <title>Clinton chides Obama on healthcare</title>
      <description>Bill Clinton says President Barack Obama should honour his pledge to let people keep their medical coverage, even if it means changing the health law.</description>

      <body>Former US President Bill Clinton says President Barack Obama should find a way to let Americans keep their health coverage under Obamacare. Insurance companies have cancelled numerous policies that do not meet the law's strict requirements, even though Mr Obama initially pledged otherwise. Mr Clinton said his fellow Democrat should "honour" his commitment, even if it means changing the law. Republicans seized on Mr Clinton's comments. In addition to the cancelled insurance policies, the federal website established under the law - which allows consumers to shop for private health insurance plans - has been plagued by glitches. Mr Clinton campaigned for the Affordable Care Act, but now he is the latest politician to speak out against it. "I personally believe, even if it takes a change in the law, that the president should honour the commitment the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they've got," Mr Clinton said in an interview published on Tuesday. The former president - who is a Democrat, like Mr Obama - did reaffirm his support for the healthcare law, though, saying: "The big lesson is we're better off with this programme than we are without it." His comments come just days after Mr Obama apologised to those people whose policies have been cancelled under Obamacare. "I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me," he said in an interview with NBC News on 8 November. "We didn't do a good enough job in terms of how we crafted the law," he added. "We've got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them, and we are going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this." On Tuesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the president was exploring possible administrative action. "The president has tasked his team with looking at a range of options," Mr Carney said. Republicans - who have fought the president's healthcare law at every turn - seized on Mr Clinton's comments, claiming they "signify a growing recognition that Americans were misled". "The entire healthcare law is a train wreck that needs to go," House Speaker John Boehner said, a form of words often-used in Republican attacks on the law. "While the two parties may disagree on that point, it shouldn't stop reasonable Democrats from working with us to shield Americans from its most egregious consequences - like the millions of current health plans being cancelled," he added. The House of Representatives is expected to consider Republican-sponsored legislation later this week that would allow consumers to keep their coverage. The White House has said it is against that proposal, which would allow insurers to continue selling medical coverage that does not offer the level of benefits required under Obamacare. "Any fix that would essentially open up for insurers the ability to sell new plans that do not meet standards would create more problems than it fixed," said Mr Carney. </body>

      <title>E-cigarettes 'could save millions'</title>
      <description>Scientists say that if all smokers in the world switch from cigarettes to electronic cigarettes, it can save millions of lives.</description>

      <body>Scientists say that if all smokers in the world switched from cigarettes to electronic cigarettes, it could save millions of lives. In the UK there are currently about 100,000 deaths per year attributable to smoking, worldwide it is estimated to be more than five million. Now researchers are hopeful that an increasing use of e-cigarettes could prevent some of these deaths. But some groups warn that e-cigarettes could normalise smoking. An estimated 700,000 users smoke e-cigarettes in the UK, according to Action on Smoking and Health. Some users combine "vaping", as it is often called, with traditional cigarettes while others substitute it for smoking completely. E-cigarettes have also recently be found to be just as effective as nicotine patches in helping smokers quit. Rather than inhaling the toxic substances found in tobacco, e-cigarette users inhale vaporised liquid nicotine. Robert West, professor of health psychology at University College London, told delegates at the 2013 E-Cigarette Summit at London's Royal Society that "literally millions of lives" could be saved. "The big question, and why we're here, is whether that goal can be realised and how best to do it... and what kind of cultural, regulatory environment can be put in place to make sure that's achieved. "I think it can be achieved but that's a hope, a promise, not a reality," he said. This view was echoed by Dr Jacques Le Houezec, a private consultant who has been researching the effects of nicotine and tobacco. He said that because the harmful effects of its main comparator, tobacco, e-cigarette use should not be over-regulated. "We've been in the field for very long, this for us is a revolution. "Every adolescent tries something new, many try smoking. I would prefer they try e-cigarettes to regular cigarettes." Dr Le Houezec added. Many are now calling for the industry to be regulated. An EU proposal to regulate e-cigarettes as a medicine was recently rejected, but in the UK e-cigarettes will be licensed as a medicine from 2016. Konstantinos Farsalinos, from the University Hospital Gathuisberg, Belgium, said it was important for light regulation to be put in place "as soon as possible". "Companies are all hiding behind the lack of regulation and are not performing any tests on their products, this is a big problem." Prof Farsalinos studies the health impacts of e-cigarette vapour. Despite the lack of regulation, he remained positive about the health risks associated with inhaling it. E-cigarettes are still relatively new, so there is little in the way of long-term studies looking at their overall health impacts. In order to have valid clinical data, a large group of e-cigarette users would need to be followed for many years. Seeing as many users aim to stop smoking, following a large group of e-smokers for a long period could be difficult. But in rats at least, a study showed that after they inhaled nicotine for two years, there were no harmful effects. This was found in a 1996 study before e-cigarettes were on the market, a study Dr Le Houezec said was reassuring. Concern about the increase in e-cigarette use remains. The World Health Organization advised that consumers should not use e-cigarettes until they are deemed safe. They said the potential risks "remain undetermined" and that the contents of the vapour emissions had not been thoroughly studied The British Medical Association has called for a ban on public vaping in the same way that public smoking was banned. They stated that a strong regulatory framework was needed to "restrict their marketing, sale and promotion so that it is only targeted at smokers as a way of cutting down and quitting, and does not appeal to non-smokers, in particular children and young people". Ram Moorthy, from the British Medical Association, said that their use normalises smoking behaviour. "We don't want that behaviour to be considered normal again and that e-cigarettes are used as an alternative for the areas that people cannot smoke," he told BBC News. But Lynne Dawkins, from the University of East London, said that while light-touch regulation was important, it must be treated with caution. She said that e-cigarettes presented a "viable safer alternative" to offer to smokers. "We don't want to spoil this great opportunity we have for overseeing this unprecedented growth and evolving technology that has not been seen before, We have to be careful not to stump that." </body>

      <title>'Hidden workforce crisis' in nursing</title>
      <description>NHS trusts trying to recruit more nurses in the wake of the Mid Staffs scandal may struggle, says the Royal College of Nursing.</description>

      <body>NHS trusts trying to recruit more nurses in the wake of the Mid Staffs scandal may struggle, a nursing union is warning. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) says there are nearly 20,000 unfilled posts in England. And it says more than a fifth of trusts are recruiting nurses from abroad. The government says staffing levels have improved - there are now over 1,350 more qualified nurses, midwives and health visitors than a year ago. The RCN sent requests under the Freedom of Information Act to all acute, mental health and community NHS trusts in England as part of its three-year-old Frontline First campaign against job cuts. Some 61 organisations replied - representing a response rate of 24%. The trusts who responded had an average vacancy rate of 6% - though in some trusts this was as high as 16%. The union believes this constitutes "a hidden workforce crisis". The RCN asked for the data because the government stopped collecting it in 2011. The last available figures showed a vacancy rate of 2.5%. More trusts - 140 - answered questions about overseas recruitment. These replies showed 22% were recruiting nurses from abroad, while a further 9% were considering the possibility. Earlier this year an inquiry highlighted the "appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of people" at Stafford Hospital in Staffordshire. The Francis report found systemic failures that went right to the top of the NHS in England. On Tuesday the RCN's head of policy, Howard Catton, said: "In recent months we've seen the 'Francis effect' after the report into Stafford Hospital, with some trusts unfreezing posts that were vacant. "But when they've gone to the market to try to recruit staff, they've found it difficult. This is because there's been a cut in the number of nursing student places. "And overseas recruitment is more difficult, because there's a shortage of many thousands of nurses across the EU." Official figures show 5,870 nursing posts have been lost in England since 2010. Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the RCN, said: "Unsafe staffing levels have been implicated in a number of high profile investigations into patient safety. "We call on employers in the NHS to put an end to boom-and-bust workforce planning and develop clear standards to ensure safe staffing levels are met, supported by robust inspection based on reliable data." Health Minister Norman Lamb said: "Nursing leaders have been clear that hospitals should publish staffing details and the evidence to show the numbers are right for the services they deliver. "Patient-safety experts agree that safe staff-patient ratios should be set locally. "We will be announcing more on our plans to guide staffing decisions in our full response to the Francis report later this autumn. "Overall, the number of clinical staff in the NHS has increased by nearly 4,100 and the number of admin staff has fallen by 22,800. "The chief inspector of hospitals will be able to take action if trusts are found to be compromising patient care by not having the right number of staff on wards." Jane Cummings, Chief Nursing Officer for England, said a growing number of Trusts were reviewing and increasing their nurse staffing levels to meet local patient need. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: "David Cameron is making matters worse. We should be bringing on the next generation of British nurses, but he's cutting trainee nurse posts whilst wasting money on overseas recruitment." The organisation NHS Employers said the figures needed to be seen in the context of the 347,000 qualified nurses working in the NHS every day. Every month the NHS recruits around 10,000 staff through natural turnover, it said. </body>

      <title>Hospital closures challenge fails</title>
      <description>A north London council fails to get a judicial review of the decision to close a hospital's accident and emergency unit.</description>

      <body>A north London council has failed to get a judicial review of the decision to close a hospital's accident and emergency (AandE) unit. Enfield Council had argued in the High Court that the closure at Chase Farm Hospital was unlawful and a "grave breach" of residents' expectations. Mr Justice Bean ruled the council had "no arguable case for judicial review". The hospital said the AandE unit would close on 9 December while the maternity unit would close this month. "Enfield Council is bitterly disappointed that it has been unable to overturn this flawed and shameful decision through the legal process," council leader Doug Taylor said. "We do not believe the views of residents have been heeded or their concerns addressed. "Instead the secretary of state and the NHS have reneged on promises to improve primary care and then shamefully steamrollered through their plans." But Dr Nick Losseff, medical director for Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Clinical Strategy, welcomed the decision. "Clearly we are pleased that the court has ruled that we can proceed with these moves to AandE services" he said. "The NHS has been carefully planning these changes to provide better, safer care for local residents in Barnet, Enfield and Haringey for many years." The services at Chase Farm Hospital will move to Barnet and North Middlesex hospitals, the local NHS Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) said. Delivering the ruling, the judge said: "Enfield has fought the good fight to save the AandE department at Chase Farm from closure for several years, and I appreciate the council genuinely believes that it would be in the interests of those they represent for the department to remain open. "But in legal terms that fight has reached the end of the road. I have come to the conclusion that the council has no arguable case for judicial review." Former health secretary Andrew Lansley approved the plans as part of a move to reorganise hospital services but health campaigners, GPs and the council have opposed the move for the past six years. </body>

      <title>Neonatal care decision overturned</title>
      <description>A decision to transfer specialist care for some of sickest babies in north Wales to England is overturned by the first minister - although some will still need to to be treated over the border.</description>

      <body>A decision to transfer specialist care for some of sickest and most premature babies in north Wales to England has been overturned by the first minister. Carwyn Jones said he accepted an independent review's suggestion that intensive care for babies be centralised at one north Wales site. But he said some babies needing the highest care level will need to go to Arrowe Park hospital on the Wirral. The original decision was taken due to lack of specialist staff. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) announced plans earlier this year to move specialist intensive care for babies across the border. But Mr Jones said the decision on Tuesday means the number of babies needing treatment in north west England each year would be "in the low tens". Mr Jones told AMs the best location, for the so called, sub-regional neonatal intensive care centre will be discussed by an independent panel that will report to him in the coming months. Currently two hospitals in north Wales provide specialist (level 3) neonatal care - Glan Clwyd hospital in Bodelwyddan and Wrexham Maelor hospital. Mr Jones said his decision would mean the vast majority of babies needing high level care could be treated in north Wales But he also said he was rejecting a proposal that would see all levels of neonatal services provided exclusively in north Wales. The first minister told assembly members that model could take 10 years to achieve and that the extra staff and costs associated with it meant it was not an option he was pursuing at this time. "This review supports the widely known principles that to deliver safe and sustainable services some centralisation of expertise must take place," he said. "I want to see the best services possible available to the people of Wales and I anticipate this review and subsequent actions will lead to the delivery of strong, sustainable services." BCUHB welcomed the review and Mr Jones's response to it. In a statement the health board said: "We are pleased that the decisions taken by the board to make sure that the most premature and seriously ill babies from north Wales are cared for by a specialist neonatal team have been supported. "The report is an important step forward and will help to ensure that we can continue to deliver most of the neonatal services locally. "We look forward to working with the independent panel to consider where these services will be located in the future," the statement concluded. Ministers launched the review after opposition to the health board's original plans. There were protests from parents, medical professionals and politicians. The health board estimated around 36 babies a year would be affected by its proposals. In the spring, the first minister asked the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) to review the decision to see if it would be possible to keep high level baby care at at least one north Wales hospital. That review has now recommended: The review warns that without investment, it believes the Welsh government's aspirations for neonatal care "will only be realised by increasing numbers of infants being transferred to England." Shadow Health Minister Darren Millar said the report "goes some way" towards ending "uncertainty" in communities across north Wales. "A cross-party campaign long warned that axing long-term neonatal care in the region was dangerous - a view supported by health professionals and clinicians. "Communities have been left in limbo for far too long and a site for a new centralised centre for neonatal care must now be identified as soon as possible." But Plaid Cymru North Wales AM Llyr Gruffydd accused Mr Jones of not wanting to take responsibility "on matters that directly affect the people of Wales". "The Labour government's plans mean that our most vulnerable babies will be sent to the NHS in England that the first minister has been so critical of. "Plaid Cymru has always made the case for the retention of these life-saving services in north Wales, and for north Wales to maintain this level of expertise." Liberal Democrat AM Aled Roberts said there needed to be more clarity on what would happen next, the timescale involved and he raised questions over governance arrangements between the health board and Arrowe Park hospital. "I think it's this confidence in the transparency of governance and practical arrangements going forward that is really missing from our relationship with Betsi Cadwaladr at the current time," he said. </body>

      <title>Target MMR at teenagers, report says</title>
      <description>"Aggressive control" of measles, including targeting teenagers who have not received the MMR vaccination, is urged by a review into an epidemic in south west Wales.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-24911227</url>
      <date>1384263397</date>

      <body>"Assertive" efforts need to be made to target teenagers who have not received the MMR vaccination in a bid to eliminate measles from Wales. A joint health boards' report looking at Wales' largest measles outbreak said there should be a policy of "aggressive control". One idea is for unimmunised children to be excluded from school if a close contact has measles during an outbreak. One man died and over 1,200 people were affected in the Swansea-based epidemic. It had started a year ago when four children returned with measles from a holiday camp in south-west England. The report comes as a new outbreak is affecting the Swansea and Neath area, with 36 reported cases so far since the start of October. One senior public health doctor has voiced his frustration with a second outbreak occurring only months after the last one was declared over. The report has been jointly produced by Public Health Wales (PHW) and the three boards affected by the outbreak, Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board, Hywel Dda, and Powys teaching health board. It found there was far more public support for vaccination following the outbreak. Uptake among five-year-olds is now at 92.8%, the highest since the MMR was introduced. At the launch of the report, Dr Marion Lyons, director of health protection for PHW, said head teachers were key to school vaccination campaigns. Questioned about compulsory vaccination, she said as confidence in the MMR was good, it would be better to concentrate on why some children were not vaccinated, and look at the issue of children giving consent. Among the 16 recommendations, the report said unimmunised close contacts of any probable cases of measles in outbreak cases should be excluded from school and other child centred social settings until the infectious period was over, backed up with a formal request under public health law if necessary. Schools should start immunisation sessions within two days of a case occurring if vaccination levels are low. Where teenagers are involved, it said social media and other communication channels should be used to target them directly, and backed up by easy access to MMR injections including at outreach clinics. It also suggested giving the MMR at places like sexual health clinics. The report revealed testing by PHW found there were four strains of the disease circulating, meaning there were four separate outbreaks happening simultaneously. It recommended the Welsh government should commission a review looking at the issue of teenagers not being immunised, reviewing scientific evidence of what works and identifying areas for further research if needed. Swansea and the surrounding region had a lower level of immunisation among 10-18-year-olds prior to the outbreak. This was attributed to parental fears at the time the children were the age when MMR is usually given following reports of now discredited links between the vaccine and autism. There were over 50,000 children in this age group unvaccinated across Wales, and only 21,493 came forward for the jab. The epidemic, which ran from November 2012 to June this year, saw 88 people admitted to hospital. Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, from Swansea, died of pneumonia after contracting the measles virus. Dr Lyons said: "The report into the outbreak shows how four cases of measles contracted by children from Wales visiting a holiday camp in England became more than 1,200 cases in the space of eight months. "The only guarantee against catching measles is receiving the full two doses of the MMR vaccine, and while we have 30,000 children and young people still needing vaccination, we can't assume we will not see further outbreaks of this scale. "With 88 people being admitted to hospital and one dying during this outbreak, it's clear that measles is a serious illness and no parent or young person should believe it cannot happen to them." Dr Sara Hayes, director of public health for ABMU, urged young people who had not been vaccinated to come forward and contact their doctor. She added the outbreak centred around Neath "shows that, despite the large outbreak being over, measles is still a very real problem in Wales". </body>

      <body>The Belfast Health Trust has formally apologised for the shortcomings in the care of five children who died at the Royal Hospitals in Belfast. The trust's chief executive, Colm Donaghy, told the hyponatraemia inquiry that the agony and pain felt by the parents cannot be underestimated. Hyponatraemia is an abnormally low level of sodium in blood and can occur when fluids are given incorrectly. However, the families said the trust's apology had come too late. The families added that the way they had been treated was disgraceful. Mr Donaghy said, on behalf of the trust, that it regrets most sincerely the pain and suffering experienced by the families of Adam Strain, Claire Roberts, Lucy Crawford, Raychel Ferguson and Conor Mitchell. The mothers of Claire and Raychel wept as the chief executive read the apology. Later, Raychel's mother Marie told the BBC: "This inquiry's coming to an end now this week, but it's not the end for us. "We still, every day, live with the pain that we're not going to see our children again. "What we want now is accountability - people have to be held accountable for our children's deaths and I'm calling on the PSNI to look at this again." Mr Donaghy acknowledged how litigation had been handled by the trust had added to the hurt and grief felt by the families. He went on to apologise unreservedly for the unacceptable delay in the Belfast Health Trust's handling of litigation and accepting of liability. The inquiry was established in 2005 but has been postponed on several occasions. The inquiry is examining the deaths of three children, Adam Strain, Claire Roberts and Raychel Ferguson. It is also investigating the events following the deaths of Lucy Crawford and Conor Mitchell. All of the children died in Belfast hospitals. In relation to four of the deaths, hyponatraemia is said to be a contributing factor. Raychel Ferguson was treated initially at Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry while Conor was cared for initially at Craigavon Area Hospital before being moved to the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children. "It is clear that important aspects of the care and treatment afforded to the children at Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children - in particular, fluid management - was poor," Mr Donaghy added. "Communication with families was not sufficiently transparent. "Our medical and nursing staff missed the opportunity to reflect on what may have gone wrong and consequently there was a lack of communication with the wider acute hospitals network in Northern Ireland and the Department of Health." Mr Donaghy also told the inquiry's chairman, Mr Justice O'Hara, that in all his years as a chief executive, the inquiry had had the "most significant impact" on my trust in terms of the learning from it. "There is no member of staff who has remained untouched by the inquiry's impact," he said. The inquiry is trying to establish who, within the Department of Health, knew about the deaths of the five children and, if they knew, why the information was not acted upon. </body>

      <body>Using magnetic fields to alter brain activity may help some people quit smoking, according to an early study. The researchers said they had used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to "undo" nicotine addiction in the brain. The findings, presented at the Neuroscience 2013 conference, suggested the technique could help people cut down or quit completely. Further trials are needed before it could be recommended as a therapy. TMS stimulates neurons to alter brain function and is already used in some patients with depression. The team at Ben Gurion University in Israel targeted magnetic fields at two regions of the brain associated with addiction to nicotine - the prefrontal cortex and the insula cortex. The 115 regular smokers in the study were split into three groups and for 13 days they were given high-frequency TMS, low-frequency TMS or no treatment at all. Those getting high-frequency TMS had lower levels of smoking and were more likely to have quit at the end of the six-month study. The highest success came when participants were also shown pictures of a lit cigarette while having the magnetic therapy - a third had quit after six months. The researchers argue the therapy may be changing the brain's hardwired response to smoking "cues". Dr Abraham Zangen, from Ben Gurion University, said: "Our research shows us that we may actually be able to undo some of the changes to the brain caused by chronic smoking. "We know that many smokers want to quit or smoke less and this could help put a dent in the number one cause of preventable deaths." Dr Chris Chambers, who specialises in TMS at Cardiff University, told the BBC: "This is a neat, well-controlled study. "Its main contribution is to add to growing evidence that brain stimulation, when applied to specific parts of the frontal lobe, can boost our ability to overcome addictions. "This is exciting and has a myriad of applications in psychiatry." However, he cautioned that the study had not yet been peer-reviewed and that "we need to develop a much clearer understanding of why and how such methods work". A separate study, reported at the same conference, suggested that stimulating the brain with implanted electrodes may help combat heroin addiction. Normally, rats given free access to the drug at the press of a lever will keep taking more and more of the drug as they become addicted. However, those having deep brain stimulation took less of the drug and did not show the escalating drug-use pattern. Commenting on both studies, Prof Barry Everitt, from the University of Cambridge, said: "Non-drug interventions would be an enormous step forward in drug abuse treatment, which currently relies on replacing one drug with another and has an extremely high rate of relapse." </body>

      <body>A camel has tested positive for the Sars-like virus that emerged in the Middle East last year and has killed 64 people worldwide. The animal had been owned by a person diagnosed with Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) coronavirus, the Saudi health ministry said. It remains unclear, however, if camels are responsible for passing the disease to humans. Coronaviruses cause respiratory infections in humans and animals. It is possible the virus is spread in droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Experts believe the virus is not very contagious - if it were, we would have seen more cases. Globally, since September 2012, there have been 153 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Mers coronavirus. The Saudi government statement said "preliminary" laboratory checks had proved positive. The health ministry said it was working with the ministry of agriculture and laboratories to "isolate the virus and compare its genetic structure with that of the patient's". If the virus carried by the camel and that of the patient "prove to be identical, this would be a first scientific discovery worldwide, and a door to identify the source of the virus", it added. The World Health Organization, which has been monitoring the global situation, says there is currently no reason to impose any travel restrictions because of the virus. </body>

      <title>'24-hour' complaint process needed</title>
      <description>Patients, carers and relatives should be able to raise concerns over NHS care 24 hours a day, suggests Health Ombudsman Julie Mellor.</description>

      <body>Patients, carers and relatives should be able to raise concerns over NHS care 24 hours a day, suggests Health Ombudsman Julie Mellor. In this week's Scrubbing Up - she explains how she hopes the Clwyd-Hart Review of hospital complaints will help tackle the "toxic cocktail" of reluctance by patients to complain and defensiveness of NHS organisations when addressing complaints and concerns. Too often we hear of patients not having the confidence to raise a concern on a hospital ward. They fear they won't be listened to or taken seriously. Even if they do complain, they can find NHS organisations defensive rather than open to feedback. One of the many people who we've spoken to about complaining said: "I feel like the little man against the system". We know this is an issue from the ward to the hospital board. The Ombudsman report 'NHS governance of complaints handling' found that only a fifth of NHS boards review learning from complaints and subsequently take action to improve services. People come to us once they've exhausted the local NHS complaints process. Our new approach from April this year means we have already accepted three times more complaints for investigation than we did last year and are sharing more learning from them with the NHS. We want hospitals to change their approach too and to welcome complaints and concerns raised by patients and carers at a local level as opportunities for improvement. We think it is critical that the "toxic cocktail" of reluctance to complain by patients coupled with defensiveness by NHS staff and organisations is tackled as a priority. We need to see a shift to a more open, collaborative and transparent culture within the NHS. This emphasis on local resolution can lead to opportunities to learn and improve services, providing a change in complaints handling from ward to board level. In order to deliver this change, there needs to be a focus on what patients need to help them raise a concern. The research and evidence we submitted to the Clwyd-Hart Review provides a powerful picture of what good complaint handling looks like. For patients and carers, advice on how to raise a concern should be accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so that every patient, carer and relative would have the opportunity to raise an issue in person, by email or over the phone. They would also receive support in doing so through local advocacy services. We have suggested the creation of one easily identifiable brand for this which could be used by all advocacy services in every local authority in England. For hospitals, boards should take the lead in bringing about a change in culture from defensiveness to one that welcomes and encourages feedback, where they use information from complaints to put things right. And commissioners and regulators need to hold NHS organisations to account with regard to listening to concerns and using information from them to improve services. Improving complaints handling will ensure that the same mistakes in patient care do not happen time and time again. It will also help to better the public's confidence in the NHS. </body>

      <description>Two doctors attack conventional medical equipment with power tools</description>

      <body>Archimedes did it in the bath, Tesla with a walking stick and the father of the sticky note had his flash of inspiration while singing in church - or so legend has it. Yet today we expect new inventions to be born in anonymous laboratories after the submission of several grant proposals. But the age of the home-grown inventor may not be over. David Williams and John Dingley are consultant anaesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Their moment of genius came in their garages while tinkering with glue-guns and car-body filler. Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they wondered "almost jokingly" whether it might be possible to make something similarly economical and easy-to-use in the medical world. And having worked in remote settings, Dr Williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be. In Zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable mains power supply. So the doctors set themselves the challenge of inventing essential kit for the doctor's bag on a budget. And after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools, they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives. The ShakerScope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people's eyes, ears and throats. But unlike regular devices it does not need batteries. Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said: "According to the World Health Organisation, 95% of medical devices fail to work in developing countries. Often designers in the West don't understand the conditions elsewhere. "This type of invention is very important. With these scopes you would normally need three different instruments for each examination, each one requiring batteries. For low income countries this is a joke. " At the core of the ShakerScope is a powerful moveable magnet, surrounded by a coil of wire. As noted by Michael Faraday in 1831, as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induces an electric current in the coil. And shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes. "That might not sound like long but it is more than enough time for most ear or eye examinations or to insert tracheal tubes," Dr Williams said. Once the scope is shaken the charge can be stored for many weeks. And instead of using a conventional light bulb, it uses a light emitting diode which can last up to 10,000 hours. The team has designed changeable heads allowing it be converted into a number of devices. One of its most promising uses so far has been as a laryngoscope - an instrument which lights-up the back of the mouth allowing anaesthetists to insert breathing tubes when people are unable to breathe for themselves. It has already been tested in military hospitals in Afghanistan, in Uganda and after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. "In Haiti we saw a lady with a neck injury who urgently needed a tracheal tube to help stabilise her. There were no other functioning laryngoscopes close by and the ShakerScope worked well despite the difficult case," said Dr Williams. According to Dr Williams the project has been a series of steep learning curves. "Having the good idea is the easy part. Making it into a reality required an almost obsessive degree of dedication," he said. In the early days the doctors tried to do as much as possible from home - from teaching themselves microelectronics to perfecting their computer-aided design skills. Luckily for Dr Williams, his wife is a sculptor who works on large pieces of metal. He has been known to borrow her workshop, saws and glue-gun on many occasions. But he says he learned very early on that the kitchen may not be the best place to melt plastics. Dr Jerry Nolan, a consultant anaesthetist at Bath Royal United NHS Trust, who was not involved in the research said: "The ShakerScope has the potential to be invaluable in remote locations. "That they have taught themselves the skills to get a final version near to market is even more remarkable and surely disproves the adage doctors make poor businessmen." The device is one of many frugal, home-grown devices recently showcased at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in the UK. Having made several fully-functioning versions tested across the world, the doctors say they recently reached the limit of their technical abilities, and passed on further manufacturing and design to a larger company. But these anaesthetists have returned to their sheds and have many other possible irons in the fire. </body>

      <body>Almost 9,000 people die from conditions related to alcohol each year in the UK. A former government drugs advisor, Professor David Nutt, believes it is possible to have the sensation of alcohol - minus the risk to your health. But the power of the drinks industry means that it would be difficult to bring this product to market. Professor Nutt, says that not only has he identified compounds that can give the sensation of alcohol, but also one which can reverse those effects - meaning people could become instantly sober - and he is trying to find investors willing to develop the idea. He said: "I think this would be a serious revolution in health... just like the e-cigarette is going to revolutionise the smoking of tobacco. "I find it weird that we haven't been speaking about this before, as it's such a target for health improvement." First broadcast on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday 11 November 2013. </body>

      <body>The health challenge left in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan is vast and daunting. As well as clearing dead bodies and responding to the immediate injuries and trauma, there are many "regular" health needs to be met. It's expected that 12,000 babies will be born this month in the affected areas. People with illnesses such as diabetes or heart disease will need to get their regular medication, even though many transport routes have been destroyed. With tens of thousands of people now homeless, there is mounting concern that crowded living conditions and contaminated drinking water could lead to outbreaks of infectious diseases. The peak danger period for this is between 10 days and one month after the event, according to the World Health Organization. Unsafe food and a lack of access to safe water, lack of facilities for personal hygiene and safe sanitation arrangements all create a breading ground for infections, such as cholera. With another tropical storm expected to hit the Philippines later this week, the need for shelter, safe water and sanitation is critical. WHO is working with other humanitarian organisations to secure urgently needed water purification tablets. Special diarrhoeal disease kits with medicines and supplies to treat 3,000 cases of acute diarrhoea are also en route - contaminated water is a frequent cause of diarrhoea. Medicines and supplies to cover the basic health needs of 120,000 people for a month have been deployed. And work has begun to strengthen an early warning system that can rapidly detect disease outbreaks and other public health threats. WHO says the next steps will be critical. It is how the survivors, rather than the dead, are managed that determines if and when an epidemic may occur. There has never been a documented case of an epidemic occurring after a natural disaster that could be traced to exposure to dead bodies. Providing the most basic of needs - safe food, clean water, medicine and shelter - is what will make the difference now. </body>

      <body>The British Medical Association wants them banned - but more than a million people are now using electronic cigarettes. And a poll of nearly 1,000 people for BBC Breakfast suggests most support their use in public places and don't want to see a ban. At Westfield shopping centre in London, Katherine Devlin, who represents the electronic cigarette industry, is vaping - not smoking. What looks like smoke coming out of her mouth is actually largely water vapour. But should she be allowed to use her e-cigarette in an enclosed public place like this? She says: "It's really important that electronic cigarettes are allowed to be used in public as widely as possible so that as many smokers as possible are aware that they have this option. "The more smokers we can get to make the switch, the bigger the public health gain we can achieve." E-cigarettes work by vaporising liquid nicotine. There's no tobacco, no smoke. It's the smoke in normal cigarettes that kills. But shoppers had mixed views about Ms Devlin using her e-cigarette inside. "I don't like it," one woman said. "I don't like anything that leads to addiction. It's related to cigarettes isn't it ? It's nicotine." "It's a substitute for cigarettes," said a male shopper. "I think it's great for people who are trying to give up smoking." The smoking ban doesn't apply to e-cigarettes because there's no smoke. It means, in theory, they can be used anywhere - trains, planes even hospitals. When asked by BBC Breakfast: "Would you feel uncomfortable if someone used an e-cigarette near you are your family?" 75 % said no. And asked if e-cigarettes should be banned in public places, 34% said yes - but 62% said no. The debate around e-cigarettes has sharply divided medical opinion. Some see them as a huge potential public health prize that could save millions of lives. Others worry about the effects of their long-term use, their regulation and their safety. "It is clear they are less harmful by several magnitudes than smoking," says Dr Ram Moorthy, from the British Medical Association. "But we still need to have a much greater evidence base about how safe they are." The BMA has called for e-cigarettes to be banned in public places. "Our concern with the use of e-cigarettes is that it normalises behaviour that has become socially unacceptable," says Dr Moorthy. "Our biggest concern is that something that looks like smoking becomes glamorous again and may be attractive to children." Many have now followed the BMA advice. Airlines, train companies and the pub chain JD Wetherspoon have all banned the use of e-cigarettes, as has the University of London, which introduced a ban last month. "We were heavily influenced by the advice from the BMA," says Kim Foster, from the university. "We had people sitting next to each other in cafes and actually saying, 'Well, you're smoking, you shouldn't be smoking in here,' and arguments were developing. "At one point a security guard had to be called. Arguments were developing and you just don't want that." Many other institutions, offices, and pubs do allow e-cigarettes. The government says it's up to individual companies and institutions to determine their own policy. The result is somewhat bizarre. E-cigarettes can be used for example in Asda supermarkets but not in Sainsbury's. Back in the shopping centre, Ms Devlin cannot use her e-cigarette in an open-air Starbucks but can just outside, where it becomes Westfield. "The current situation where you've got different rules in different places is reflective of the absolute and utter confusion there is," she says. If the BBC poll is right, the public seems to be fairly relaxed about e-cigarettes at a time when more and more places are deciding to ban them. </body>

      <body>Offering people financial incentives to adopt healthy behaviour is a controversial area of public policy. People understandably question why some people should be paid for doing something that many others do for nothing. Surely, the fact it benefits them personally in terms of their health - or their baby in the case of the latest idea put forward to offer mothers £200 of shopping vouchers to encourage breastfeeding - should be enough of an incentive? However, advocates of this approach argue sometimes it is not. They point out that behaviour can be so ingrained or subconscious that people may need something to jolt them out of their bad habits. As far as the NHS is concerned, what matters is what is cost-effective: do the gains outweigh the costs? In terms of breastfeeding, the UK has some of the worst rates in the developed world. Unicef estimates £40m a year could be saved if the numbers were improved because of the health benefits - breastfeeding has been shown to reduce cases of stomach problems, asthma and other respiratory conditions. But the NHS does have a mixed record with financial incentives. In 2009, officials in Kent set up a weight-loss scheme - Pounds for Pounds - which offered participants cash payments of up to £425. Less than half achieved significant weight loss and a high drop-out rate meant that evaluators were unable to recommend it as a way of tackling obesity. However, health officials in Dundee have had more success with a stop smoking scheme. The NHS there ran a two-year programme offering smokers £12.50 a week to quit smoking. By the end of three months, nearly a third of participants end up kicking the habit - more than twice as many as other smoking cessation projects achieved, figures released last year showed. But one of the key reasons this was a success was that it was easy to police. Smokers were asked to take regular breadth tests which were extremely accurate at gauging whether the person had lit up. By comparison this latest initiative is going to rely on the judgement of midwives and health visitors to determine whether the women taking part are indeed breastfeeding. This raises the question about whether it will be open to abuse. Prof Theresa Marteau, director of the Behaviour and Health Research Unit at Cambridge University, says this is often cited as a concern for such schemes. She is carrying out research into gaming with early findings suggesting it is limited to the "minority". "It is a debate we need to have. There is understandable sensitivity about rewarding people like this when the finances are so tight. But just because if does happen it doesn't mean we shouldn't do it." Another potential hurdle is that the team behind it are not imposing any restrictions on what the vouchers could be used for. It means those taking part could purchase cigarettes and alcohol. This contrasts with work done by what was the National Treatment Agency five years ago with drug users. They were offered vouchers, but were not allowed to spend them on luxury items. One of the key reasons for this was to make sure the project retained the confidence of the public. But to be fair researchers say this is only the first stage of the piloting of this idea. If it goes forward for a nationwide pilot next year, changes could be made to the way its run. What happens next with this project will be watched with interest. </body>

      <description>Cameron takes centre stage amid warnings of NHS A&amp;E crisis</description>

      <body>This morning the prime minister's official spokesman said something important. He was asked to comment on reports in the Financial Times that David Cameron was personally overseeing plans to prepare the NHS for a cold winter that could put pressure on accident and emergency departments. The spokesman said this: "Is the PM working very closely with the Secretary of State for Health on health matters, with a particular focus on AandE? Absolutely he is doing that." He was then asked if it was true that the prime minister had demanded weekly updates on how many people were being admitted to AandE. The spokesman replied: "Yeah, he does want to and he continues to be up-to-date with the very best and latest figures, including the AandE statistics." So at a time when Labour is warning gloomily of what it calls a "winter crisis" in AandE, when some doctors are saying that emergency care is already under pressure, when some weather forecasters are predicting a bitterly cold snap as the gulf stream heads south, the prime minister has chosen to get personally involved. As Sir Humphrey might have said, that is rather bold. For it means that Mr Cameron will be seen to be making himself personally responsible for whatever happens in the NHS this winter. If anything goes wrong, he will not be able to blame his health advisers, his health secretary, his health secretary's advisers or even the health department as a whole. The buck will now stop in Number 10. Government sources say it is all about the prime minister showing that he is taking the issue seriously, that he is focused on the operational details, that he cannot be accused of complacency. But the former Labour Health Secretary Aneurin Bevan once said that in a centralised NHS the sound of a bedpan falling in his local hospital would reverberate in the Palace of Westminster. And this winter, if AandE departments struggle to cope, it could be sound of patients complaining from trolleys that will reverberate in the corridors of Downing Street. </body>

      <title>An age-old assumption</title>
      <description>Theory of dependent older people turned on its head</description>

      <body>The idea that dependent older people represent a great demographic challenge of our age has been turned on its head. Academics from the University of Edinburgh argue numbers have actually been falling in Britain and the ratio of working adults to dependent pensioners is improving. The research questions an assumption behind arguments for health, social care and immigration policies. The findings were published in the British Medical Journal. "The extent, speed and effect of population ageing have all been exaggerated and we should not assume that it will strain health and social care systems," Professor John MacInnes and senior research fellow Jeroen Spijker write in the article 'Population Ageing: The timebomb that isn't?' The mistake people have been making, the paper suggests, is to assume that all pensioners are dependent and all working-age adults are workers. They point out that, while it is true there are now more people over 65 in the UK than children under 15, rising life expectancy means older people are effectively "younger", healthier and fitter than previous generations. Instead of simply looking at how old someone is, the research focuses on how long they might be expected to live. "Many behaviours and attitudes (including those related to health) are more strongly linked to remaining life expectancy than to age," it says. In 1841, life expectancy at birth was 40 years for males and 42 years for females. By 1900 it was 52 and 57 and today it is 79 and 83. So the point at which we enter 'old age' has also been changing. Equally, using age to define the adult working populations makes little sense, the authors suggest, because "there are more dependents of working age (9.5 million) than there are older people who do not work". So they calculated an alternative measure, what they call "the real elderly dependency ratio", based on the sum of men and women with a remaining life expectancy of up to 15 years divided by the number of people in employment, irrespective of age. Using this measure, the paper calculates that old-age dependency in the UK fell by one third over the past four decades - and is likely to stabilise close to its current level. The measure suggests similar falls in many other countries. "Our calculations show that - over the past four decades - the population far from ageing, has in fact been getting younger, with increasing numbers of people in work for every older person or child," the authors say. "The different story of population ageing told by our real elderly dependency ratio has several important implications for health policy and clinical practice." In policy terms, this analysis to one of the central challenges of an ageing population might be something of a game changer. Rather than seeing longevity itself as an expensive problem, focus could shift towards managing morbidity and remaining life expectancy. The paper demands society rethink some of its assumptions about elderly dependency - drawing a distinction between the 'young old' and the 'old old', if you like. The census in 2011 showed that 1.4 million people of state pension age in the UK were in employment - almost double what it was just two decades earlier. Of those aged between 65 and 74, 16% were economically active at the last count. Just over half of all pensioners describe themselves as being in good health and, while demand for elderly care services is rising, the BMJ article suggests the key drivers in deciding the impact on care budgets will be medical knowledge and technology. </body>

      <title>The loneliness of language difficulties</title>
      <description>Helping children with speech problems</description>

      <body>Imagine listening to a foreign language you are not familiar with all day. It would be tiring and confusing. You would miss important information and you'd have to work very hard to understand what people were saying. That's what it's like to have a specific language impairment in your own language, says Gina Conti-Ramsden, professor of child language and learning from the University of Manchester. "These children aren't mute. They can talk - but it's a hidden disability," she says. "They can't understand what is said all the time and they find it difficult to put words together, and to express themselves." Most children with SLIs have quite severe language problems and can spend at least 50% of their education in specialist language units, staffed by specialist teachers and speech therapists, rather than mainstream schools. The aim is to enable them to go back into mainstream primary or secondary school, and that they can achieve a level of language which allows them to function in society, get a job and lead a normal life as an adult. Prof Conti-Ramsden's current research project is concerned with finding out what happens to such children as adults. Ross Watson, 25, forms part of her study - the largest of its kind in the UK. He spent most of his primary education in a speech and language unit, returning to mainstream education in Year 6. He remembers it as a tough time in his life. "They didn't help much to begin with. There was a lot of mickey-taking from the other kids. And I got frustrated and upset because I couldn't do things. "I didn't understand why they made me do music lessons when it would have been better to do extra English instead." In the end, Ross got nine GCSEs, impressing himself and his teachers with a C in French and a D in English. But he is honest about how his language impairment has affected him. He has always found it hard to put sentences together, he finds himself getting edgy in new situations and uncomfortable when he has to communicate with people, particularly face to face. "Talking on the phone is easier in some ways because I can't see facial expressions, which makes it worse to communicate because I'm always wondering what they're thinking." He says he can't work out when people are being sarcastic, which has led to lots of awkward situations in the past - and he suffers from short-term memory loss. "I'm still forgetful. I forget to call people back a lot. I have to write it down to remember. And I still find reading hard. I have to use a highlighter pen. "And in a group situation I don't say things first. I don't like to say anything too early in case I've misunderstood something." However, Ross has come a long way since he was a "very quiet boy in the classroom" who had trouble finding his voice. He went on to do a course in mechanical engineering at college and now works as a quality inspector of machine parts. In between he spent six years on an apprenticeship at a major defence company. But not everyone is as lucky as him. Afasic, the charity which supports children and parents with speech, language and communication needs, says 6% of children starting school have some degree of speech or language difficulty. Around one in 500 are thought to have a serious long-term problem. Picking it up early is important, says Alison Huneke, helpline manager at Afasic. "There's more time to address it if it's picked up at this stage and then the child has less experience of failing and losing ground. "But some schools are good at recognising these problems and some aren't." In fairness, she says it isn't always easy to recognise a specific language impairment. While in some children it will be obvious, others may need a speech and language assessment first - and it is possible it could be misdiagnosed. As we grow up language is fundamental to virtually everything we do, says Prof Conti-Ramsden, and problems with it can be linked to issues which develop later in life, like anxiety and depression. The worst-case scenario is that children with specific language impairments become young offenders, since around half of this group of people are thought to have language problems. Although young people with SLIs look normal, they can suffer from loneliness, struggle to form close friendships and grow up dependent on their parents. Employment is also hard to secure. But as an adult it is also possible to focus on the things you enjoy and are good at, much more so than at school. There are lots of things that Ross still doesn't find easy, such as writing reports, talking on the phone, detecting sarcasm and speaking to his boss, but he believes he acquired an inner strength from his early years of intensive speech and language therapy. This, he says, makes him quietly confident that he has the skills to compete with the brightest and best in society. </body>

      <title>Baby steps to saving lives</title>
      <description>How a simple measurement saves lives</description>

      <body>Each year, one in 10 babies around the world will be born prematurely and over a million of those will die. But could measuring the size of a baby's feet help save lives? In the final weeks of pregnancy, the idea of going into early labour might not seem like such a bad thing. But giving birth prematurely - officially classed as before 37 weeks gestation - can lead to long-term health effects. Depending on quite how early the baby is born, infants can either be completely unaffected or left with permanent disability and learning difficulties. The issue of prematurity is particularly pronounced in South Asian and Sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for over 80% of the deaths caused by pre-term birth complications. In rural Tanzania, for example, about one in every 30 premature babies won't make it past four weeks. However, most of those lives could be saved with simple advice for mothers. And that advice, says an international group of researchers, could start with just a footprint. Most mothers in high-income countries will give birth surrounded by medical equipment or with the support of a highly-skilled midwife. This means that any problems, such as a low birth-weight or the mother's waters breaking early, can be dealt with immediately. In contrast, around 40% of women giving birth in low-income countries will do so without the help of a trained medical professional. And due to inaccurate dating of pregnancy, many of those women will have no way of telling if their baby is too early or too small. However, measuring the baby's footprint could be used as a simple proxy for birth weight. "There's this grey area when the baby is between around 2.4kg (5lbs 5oz) and 2.1kg (4lbs 10oz) when the baby is more vulnerable to infection and other issues," says Dr Joanna Schellenberg of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. "But when a baby is born at home, there is no way of weighing them," she told the BBC. To help solve the problem, Schellenberg and her colleagues at the Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania have implemented a strategy called Mtunze Mtoto Mchanga - which means "protect the newborn baby". It includes using a picture of two footprints on a piece of laminated card and a local volunteer placing the baby's foot against the images. If the baby has feet smaller than the smallest foot, around 67mm, then the mother is advised to take the baby to hospital immediately. If it measures in between the big and the small image, then the mother is told about the extra care she needs to provide to increase the baby's chances of survival. Although the card is fairly accurate for five days after birth, it should be used it to identify small babies in their first two days of life, which is when they're most at risk of dying without specialist care. Mariam Ulaya is one of the volunteers at Namayakata shuleni village and visits the women before and after the birth. "If I've measured the child's footprint and seen that the child is smaller than usual, then I instruct them to carry the child skin-to-skin so that the child can share and feel the mother's warmth," says Ulaya. "I also carry a small doll with me called Opendo. I use the doll to illustrate the proper way to breastfeed the child." Such advice may seem simple but can really be the difference between life and death. A report by the World Health Organization (WHO) says that of the 15 million premature births globally each year, more than 80% will occur between 32 and 37 weeks' gestation. Most of these babies will survive if given extra warmth through skin-to-skin contact and very regular breastfeeding to help fight off infection. In fact, the report states that an estimated 75% of deaths in preterm infants can be prevented in this way - without the cost and emotional upset of intensive care. Salima Ahmad is 25 and has three children who live with her in Namahyakata dinduma village, Tanzania. Her youngest son, Alhaji, was born prematurely. "I was a little bit shocked because many premature babies end up dying but I was also happy because I had a live baby," says Salima. Although Alhaji was born at the local hospital, Salima was given advice and support by volunteers from Mtunze Mtoto Mchanga about how to care for him once she got home. "Carrying skin-to-skin was good but difficult in the beginning. But when the volunteer was visiting me and encouraging me, I could see myself managing it slowly. It is good, it has helped my child to survive," she says. Salima also feels that understanding more about premature birth helps mothers like herself to deal with it properly. "It helps a lot for the mother not to be surprised when having a premature birth. It is useful to know in advance as you get good knowledge on how to handle the premature. Myself, I do thank the volunteer who talked about it when I was pregnant and she even taught me how to carry skin to skin." The project is still underway and it will take another six months before it's clear whether measuring feet has the ability to save thousands of lives. However, it is already having a positive effect on the way mothers in the area are preparing for childbirth. "When I had my first child, she was small and was not breastfeeding well and I did not know where to get help," says Rukia Twarib, who is currently pregnant with her second child. "Now I have information, if the situation ever happens again, I know can go to the health centre to get help." Advice from volunteers like Miriam also appears to be contributing to the increase in women now choosing to deliver at a health centre rather than at home. Dr Isa Lipupu works at the nearby Nangururwe health centre. "In the last two years, we had about 20 deliveries at the health centre. But this time we have already delivered more than 40 babies. This is about 60-80% of all the mothers that were pregnant," he says. If the strategy proves successful, then there are already plans to roll out the footprint scheme to the rest of Tanzania, giving more health volunteers the ability to quickly spot at-risk babies. "Right now many people are aware of the work I do. All the families have been very welcoming and have accepted me and this programme," says Mariam Ulaya. "I have seen a lot of changes in the area. I can see that there are more mothers visiting the clinic and giving birth there - much more than they used to do - and so I am grateful for that." </body>

      <title>'New part of knee joint discovered'</title>
      <description>A newly identified ligament may hold the key to common injuries</description>

      <body>Two knee surgeons in Belgium say they have identified a previously unfamiliar ligament in the human knee. Writing in the Journal of Anatomy, they suggest the fibrous band could play a part in one of the most common sports injuries worldwide. Despite glimpses of the ligament in medical history, this is the first time its structure and purpose have been so clearly established, they say. But experts say more studies are needed to prove its relevance to knee surgery. Four main ligaments - or thick fibrous bands - surround the knee joint, criss-crossing between the upper and lower leg bones to provide stability and prevent excessive movement of our limbs. But the anatomy of the knee remains complex, and several international groups have been exploring the less-defined structures of the joint for some time. The notion of this particular ligament was first made by French surgeon Paul Segond in 1879 but it has evaded definitive surgical classification for many years. Now building on the work of other surgeons, Dr Claes and Professor Johan Bellemans of the University Hospitals of Leuven, Belgium, say they have closely mapped the band which runs from the outer side of the thigh bone to the shin bone. And they say this anterolateral ligament could play an important protective role as we twist or change direction. Mr Joel Melton, a consultant knee surgeon at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK, who was not involved in the research said: "If you look back through history there has been a veiled understanding that something is going on on that side of the knee but this work finally gives us a better understanding. "I think this is very exciting - there is no doubt they have hit upon a very important anatomical structure." The Belgian surgeons used macroscopic dissection techniques to examine 41 donated knee joints and pinpointed this ligament in all but one specimen. And they say the presence of this band could help them better understand and treat a common sports injury that has puzzled doctors for some time - the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear. An injury to the ACL is typical in people who pivot during sport - from athletes and basketball players and footballers and skiers. A tear can happen when you change direction rapidly or stop suddenly and causes pain, swelling and reduced movement in the knee. But despite improvements in surgical techniques, between 10-20% of people with a repaired ACL tear are unable to recover fully. In particular, some patients say their knees give way as they twist or turn. Dr Claes and Bellemans think an injury to the anterolateral ligament (ALL) may be partly responsible for this. They hypothesise some people may injure the ALL at same time as the ACL, leaving the knee less stable as the leg rotates. And their biomechanical studies suggest tears in this ligament may also be to blame for small fractures that have previously been attributed to ACL injuries. Mr Paul Trikha, a knee surgeon at the Surrey Orthopaedic Clinic, who was also not involved in the research said: "I do around 150 ACL repairs each year. When I saw Dr Claes' research, it blew me away. "Knowing about the ALL has given us a better understanding of what other structures may be damaged during this common injury and this will hopefully open up opportunities to improve surgery for our patients." But reaction to this work has been mixed. Gordon Bannister, professor of orthopaedics at Bristol University said: "There is no doubt this is a very interesting paper from the anatomical point of view but at the moment this is not a major clinical breakthrough. "Its role in knee injuries is a perfectly reasonable hypothesis to test but the most important step is to see whether any intervention to the ligament actually makes a significant difference to patients." Dr Claes and Bellemans have already started exploring this possibility and are offering repairs of the new ligament in certain cases. Their next steps are to refine their techniques and monitor their patients to see if there are lasting improvements to their mobility. Dr Claes said: "We surgeons may need to rethink what we know about common ACL injuries. Though we have shed light on the purpose of this ligament and its role in common injuries, we now need to find out for certain when it is best to intervene surgically. "Long-term studies will give us that answer and hopefully allow us to perfect a minimally invasive techniques to give our patients a better recovery." </body>

      <title>Shortfall in free nursery place scheme</title>
      <description>Data shows just seven out of 10 of the most disadvantaged two-year-olds earmarked for free childcare have been offered a place.</description>

      <body>Just seven out of 10 of the most disadvantaged two-year-olds earmarked for free childcare on a flagship scheme have been offered a place, data shows. Ministers pledged 15 hours a week of free childcare to 130,000 two-year-olds in England from September. But the latest Department for Education figures show that just 92,000 children are receiving such childcare. Childcare providers said the offer, which was heralded by the deputy prime minister, was not properly funded. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-School Learning Alliance, said at a time when many providers were still underfunded for the existing free nursery place scheme for all three- and four-year-olds, it was vital that the government makes sure the two-year-old scheme is adequately funded. "This will determine the success of the initiative and the positive impact for generations to come." Some nursery providers say the average rate of funding, £5.12 per hour, is so low the work they would have to carry out with these disadvantaged children would effectively be "pro bono". This is because of the very high level of need that the children have because they are younger and sometimes highly troubled. The scheme has struggled to find enough free childcare places for disadvantaged two-year-olds, often because nursery provision tends to be in more affluent areas where the disadvantaged children being targeted do not live. Also places have to be in settings rated good or outstanding by Ofsted. In May, the BBC News Website reported that the scheme was 55,000 places short, and there were warnings that it would not open fully in all areas, with shortages predicted in London and other urban areas. Both Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Education and Childcare Minister Liz Truss have stressed the need to give disadvantaged children, who tend to do worse at school, the best start in life. Mr Clegg praised the number of places made available on the scheme, saying: "Early access to high-quality childcare is vitally important to ensure children are ready for school, ready for the world and able to get a good start in life. "Giving disadvantaged children early support gives them the best possible chance to succeed, it means they're less likely to fall behind their wealthier classmates and it can make a huge impact on their future. It is vital for a fair and prosperous society." However, the Department for Education has now said the funding for the places will in future be on a "use it or lose it basis". "The number of participating children will determine the amount of funding they get," it said. "Where parents are not taking up these place, local authorities will get less money." The department is due to expand the scheme to 260,000 children in England next September. Childcare workers association Pacey, which represents many childminders, said it was concerned that the government had already noted that in some areas it might not have enough providers rated good or outstanding to cover all the children entitled to the two-year-old offer, and would have to use providers graded as requiring improvement. Its chief executive, Liz Bayram, said: "This is of even more concern given the emerging evidence that individual childminders are struggling to access funding through this scheme, as local authorities seem to show a preference for nursery settings to deliver this care, even if those settings might not be good or outstanding. "Many families benefit from the flexible home-based service that childminders offer, so ensuring parents can make a real choice about the type of childcare that is right for them could only help increase uptake even further." Labour's shadow minister for childcare and children, Lucy Powell, said the "cost of living crisis" was being made worse by families who were promised free childcare finding that they do not have a place. "This government has hit families with reduced support, rising childcare costs and fewer places. Labour's primary childcare guarantee and the extension of free childcare for working parents from 15 to 25 hours for three and four year olds will be a real boost for families feeling the pinch and struggling to balance work and family life." </body>

      <body>Richer teenagers are three times more likely to go to top universities than working class pupils, even if they have the same grades, research suggests. Researchers compared the proportion of teenagers in England with good grades with figures for those with places at "high status" institutions. The gap between the groups is not simply due to grades, they conclude. "We need to talk about other possible causes," said Dr John Jerrim of London University's Institute of Education. The researchers also looked at the extent of the access gap between the social classes to elite universities in Australia and the United States. "Although academic achievement is an important factor, a substantial proportion of the elite university access gap in each country remains unexplained. "This suggests that there are working-class children whom, even though they have the grades to attend, choose to enter a non-selective institution instead," said Dr Jerrim, who led the research. The study suggests that children of professionals in England are 3.2 times more likely to go to a Russell Group university than working-class children. But the study found that the gap was not just down to poorer grades among working-class pupils. Once the researchers had taken pupils' exam achievements into account, they found that teenagers with good grades from professional families were 1.4 times more likely to go to one of these universities than working-class pupils with similar grades. The research suggests the access gap is in fact less pronounced in England than in the United States and Australia. In Australia, children of professionals are 2.7 times more likely to attend a highly selective university than their working-class peers but only half of this difference is explicable by high school grades, say the researchers. In the United States entry to elite private universities is dominated by students from professional backgrounds who are more than six times more likely to attend than those from working-class families. The researchers say less than half (48%) of the difference is explained by high grades. The figures for leading US public universities show wealthier students are 3.3 times more likely to attend, with around 40% of the difference explicable by grades, says the study. The paper will be presented to a summit on university access organised by the education charity Sutton Trust. Dr Jerrim will also tell the summit about differences in student funding in the three countries. Bursaries for low and middle-income students at Harvard, for example, can allow them to graduate "debt free", despite fees of more than £37,000 a year, he will say. Dr Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group, said the report showed the main reason pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds were less likely to go to leading universities "is because they are not achieving the right grades" in the right subjects. "It is also the case that some very bright students are not encouraged to apply for leading universities. We cannot offer places to those who do not apply or who have not done the right subjects to study their chosen course. "Access is an issue for leading universities across the globe - there is no silver bullet to this entrenched problem." Dr Piatt said the group was working hard to tackle the access gap, "pumping millions more into outreach programmes" and publishing advice to help students choose their A-levels. Pam Tatlow, chief executive of the million+ group said: "The Sutton Trust wrongly assumes that the interests of well-qualified students are best served if they study at a small number of universities which label themselves as elite. "Students are much more savvy than this. They understand that high-quality, top-class degrees leading to high-flying, professional careers are available at a wide range of universities. It is therefore unsurprising that they choose to study at these universities." </body>

      <title>'Flu watch' coming to UK schools</title>
      <description>Scientists are to begin collecting data on flu outbreaks from UK schools this winter to better understand its spread.</description>

      <body>Scientists are to begin collecting data on flu outbreaks from UK schools this winter to better understand its spread. The Flusurvey surveillance project is in its fifth year, but for the first time classrooms are being asked to take part. It coincides with the NHS beginning to roll out childhood flu vaccinations. In time, the nasal spray vaccine will be available for children aged 16 and under. This flu season it is being offered to all children aged two and three, as well as children of any age with long-term health conditions such as diabetes. In Scotland and seven pilot areas in England, children aged four to 11 will also be eligible for it this year. In order to help control and lower the impact of flu, the Flusurvey researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine want to understand what role children play in catching and spreading the disease. In 2012-13, the highest rates of infection were reported in the under-18 age group. Head of the project Dr Alma Adler said: "Last year we found that taking public transport does not increase your risk of catching flu and we discovered that 'man flu' didn't really exist - in fact women were slightly more likely to report feeling worse when they have flu than men. "This year we're keen to find out more about children because they are the 'key spreaders' of flu." The Flusurvey team will be working with the British Science Association to link up with schools for the 2013-14 flu season to monitor the impact of the virus. They will also be looking to see what role exercise and diet might play in keeping flu at bay. Public Health England compiles its own weekly update on flu incidence rates. Currently, there is no sign that the flu season has begun - GP consultant rates for flu-like illnesses have so far remained low throughout the UK. Figures suggest a fifth of eligible two and three-year-olds have received their flu vaccine. A third of eligible "at risk" adults and children, such as those with asthma, have been immunised, as have half of people in the over-65 age group. A new vaccine is needed each year to protect against the flu viruses expected to be in circulation that winter and to boost the immune response. Although influenza activity in the UK rose to only low levels in the 2012-13 season, activity was prolonged and reached levels higher than those seen in 2011-12. If you have flu, you generally start to feel ill within a few days of being infected. Flu causes a sudden high temperature, headache, general aches and pains, tiredness and a sore throat. The symptoms are far more severe than with a common cold. </body>

      <title>Child protection takeovers mooted</title>
      <description>More child protection services which are underperforming could be taken over by independent providers, says Education Secretary Michael Gove.</description>

      <body>Michael Gove has said that more struggling children's services departments in England could be taken over by independent providers. The Education Secretary also said he was considering opening up well performing departments to private and voluntary organisations. This would be so they could innovate and improve their services, he said. It comes amid efforts to make it easier for Mr Gove to intervene in failing children's services departments. An amendment to the Children and Families Bill in the Lords has sought to clarify the secretary of state's existing powers to intervene where child protection services are found to be underperforming. The Department for Education has insisted the move was about clarifying the current situation. But others see it as enabling a greater role for private providers in all aspects of child protection services. So far only one local authority children's services department, Doncaster, has been taken completely out of council control because it is failing. The DfE is said to be eyeing a number of other children's services departments which are thought not to be performing as well as they should. Child protection in some 20 local authorities has been judged as "inadequate" by Ofsted. These are Barnsley, Bexley, Birmingham, Blackpool, Calderdale, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire East, Cumbria, Devon, Doncaster, Herefordshire, Isle of Wight, Kingston upon Thames, Medway, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Rochdale, Sandwell, Slough and Somerset. Doncaster children's services department is now being managed by an independent firm which has been chosen as a temporary improvement partner until an independent trust is set up. In his speech at the NSPCC in London, Mr Gove said he would apply the same principles to social services departments as were already being applied to schools. In the same way that 'academisation' sees schools being put under new management, children's social services could be taken out of local authority control and effectively privatised under the control of new trusts, he suggested. He said: "I confidently expect that the improvements we will see in Doncaster mean this model will grow." Mr Gove said: "Also from today, all local authorities have the freedom to delegate their functions for children in care and childcare leavers to third parties." He described this as "a first step towards freeing up innovative and ambitious local authorities to deliver greater diversity and excellence in provision". He added: "Over the coming months, we will examine the case for extending these freedoms to more areas of children's social care services." Some innovative councils were already "reshaping" services in this way "to bring a fresh impetus to reform in a sector which has for too long been closed to the voluntary sector and other providers". Annie Hudson, chief executive of The College of Social Work, said: "We support the secretary of sState's determination to free up social workers from unnecessary bureaucracy, and to support them to be innovative and to use their professional initiative. "It is vital, however, that if local authorities do hand over some of their powers for looking after children to third parties, that there are clear lines of accountability back to them for high quality services that the public rightly expect." Listing the names of high profile child protection case tragedies, such as Daniel Pelka and Keanu Williams, Mr Gove said: "I believe that we have not been either systematic, radical or determined enough in our efforts to reform the system of child protection in this country. "But that is changing. And it is my aim to ensure that change is equal to the challenge we all face." He also criticised social workers for making excuses for the people they aim to help. He said many social workers were indoctrinated to believe such people were "victims of social injustice" This was pernicious, led to excuses being made for poor behaviour and broke the link between an individual's actions and the consequences, he added. "It risks explaining away substance abuse, domestic violence and personal irresponsibility, rather than doing away with them," he said. "Instead of working with individuals to get them to recognise harmful patterns of behaviour, and improve their own lives, some social workers acquiesce in or make excuses for these wrong choices," he added. Mr Gove, who was adopted, also paid tribute to the social workers whom he said "transformed" his life along with his adoptive parents. </body>

      <body>University academics and support staff are to stage a second national one-day strike on 3 December in a row over pay, four unions have announced. Institutions across the UK could by affected by the action by Unison, the University and College Union, Unite and the Educational Institute of Scotland. The dispute centres on a 1% pay rise offered to university staff - including lecturers and support staff. Employers expressed disappointment at the decision to take strike action. The unions say there has been a 13% pay cut in real terms since October 2008. Unison, Unite and the UCU staged a one-day walkout on 31 October. For this second planned day of action, they are being joined the the Scottish education union, the EIS. UCU head of higher education Michael MacNeil said: "Staff have suffered year-on-year cuts in the value of their pay and have made it clear that enough is enough. "We remain committed to trying to resolve this dispute and the employers now have until 3 December to sit down and positively engage with the unions. "If they don't, then our members and those from our sister unions will be out on strike again, as well as continuing to work to contract." The Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), which represents universities as employers, said it was disappointed by the announcement of industrial action. A UCEA spokesperson said: "Ever since the initial consultation at the start of this year, UCEA's 150 participating UK higher education employers have continued to say that, given the challenging and uncertain operating environment, the 1% pay uplift is a good and sustainable offer and is at the limit of affordability. "This of course sits on top of other pay elements totalling around 3% on pay. So any announcement of further industrial action is naturally disappointing. "However, less than 5% of staff voted to support this and nine out of 10 of institutions reported 'no to low' impact from the day of action on 31 October. "UCEA continues to say that it is willing to talk to the disputing trade unions so that we can explore together whether the dispute can be resolved." Union leaders said the day of action in October affected 149 UK universities, with support services such as catering, cleaning and security hit alongside academic departments. The National Union of Students (NUS) urged both sides to work towards a speedy resolution to the dispute. NUS president Toni Pearce said: "For that to happen we need to see the employers getting round the table with the unions and negotiating a fair and sustainable settlement. "Students want the staff in our universities and colleges to be treated well and paid fairly. "Our own research shows that more than half of UK universities pay at least some of their staff less than the living wage. "It is those on lower wages such as porters, cleaners and kitchen staff who have already lost out in the pay squeeze and now stand to lose out again." </body>

      <title>Care leavers get 'raw deal', say MPs</title>
      <description>Young people leaving care are given a "raw deal", according to a report for an all party group of MPs.</description>

      <body>Young people leaving care are given a "raw deal", according to research for an all party group of MPs. Many care leavers miss out because they do not know what support they are entitled to, says the report. Some 500 children and young people and a further 500 care professionals were interviewed by researchers from the charity Who Cares? Trust. "We have heard very troubling stories," said Natasha Finlayson, the charity's chief executive. "In too many cases young people are being kept in the dark, completely unaware of the support they should be getting automatically. "Children in care and care leavers have had tough starts in life and are trying to find their way in the world without the support of their families. "This is why this support is a legal requirement. It is absolutely crucial that they all get the support they have a right to without exception. "As this report makes clear, this is not happening", said Ms Finlayson. The report, for the All Party Parliamentary Group for Looked After Children and Care Leavers, found more than seven in 10 said they had had insufficient information about the support they should receive from their local authority. A third did not know their local authority was obliged to help them with the costs of being in education or training at least up to the age of 21. Over half were unaware of a £1,200 bursary to help them stay in education after the age of 16 or that their local authority must help them with accommodation during university holidays. Care leavers without this information were likely to be put off staying in education, said the authors. The inquiry also found that fewer than half of care leavers knew they were entitled to help with the costs of getting and keeping a job. Only a third receive an allowance of £2,000 to help them set up home when they leave care and buy essential items such as fridges, cookers and furniture, says the report. Some young people told the researchers they thought their local councils were deliberately withholding information from them in order to save money. "We are concerned that financial considerations appear in some cases to be prioritised above the best interests of the child," says the report. "Not enough children in care are being told about their legal entitlements, and the support they do receive is not consistent enough," said Craig Whittaker MP, chairman of the parliamentary group. Mr Whitaker added that professionals who worked with looked after children were also often under-informed when it came to knowing how best to support care leavers. The inquiry sets out 10 recommendations to help young people leaving care or about to leave care access the support they are due. These include managing social workers' caseloads so that they have enough time to explain the help available to individual care leavers and better training for professionals to ensure they have up-to-date knowledge on care leavers' rights. David Simmonds, chairman of the Local Government Association's children and young people board, said councils were committed to supporting young people "more effectively" as they moved from care into adulthood. "Children come into care in the most difficult circumstances and giving them the best opportunities to overcome these and get a good start in life is a major focus for councils. "The enquiry highlights that pressure on resources and a confusing jumble of national employment schemes make the transition to adulthood more challenging than it should be." </body>

      <title>Private school clout 'shocks' Major</title>
      <description>The influence that a privately educated, middle-class elite have on public life is "shocking", former prime minister Sir John Major says.</description>

      <body>The influence that a privately educated, middle-class elite have on public life is "shocking", former prime minister Sir John Major has said. Sir John said the "upper echelons of power" were dominated by those from a similar background. In a speech to Tory activists reported in the Daily Telegraph he blamed "the collapse in social mobility" on the failures of the last Labour government. More than half the current cabinet were educated at private schools. David Cameron was educated at Eton, as was the Mayor of London Boris Johnson and the Archbishop of Canterbury The Right Reverend Justin Welby. Nick Clegg attended Westminster while George Osborne and deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman went to St Paul's. In contrast, Sir John - prime minister between 1990 and 1997 - grew up in Brixton and left his grammar school with three O-levels. In a speech to the South Norfolk Conservative Association's annual dinner, he bemoaned what he said was the lack of people from working and lower middle class backgrounds in positions of influence in British institutions. "In every single sphere of British influence, the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class," he said. "To me, from my background, I find that truly shocking." Sir John said the Labour government, in power between 1997 and 2010, had left a legacy of a "Victorian divide between stagnation and aspiration" which current leader Ed Miliband was in no position to address. Too many children, he added, were "locked into the circumstances in which they were born" as a result of a lack of educational opportunities. He added: "I remember enough of my past to be outraged on behalf of the people abandoned when social mobility is lost... we need them to fly as high as their luck, their ability and their sheer hard graft can actually take them. "And it is not going to happen magically." Sir John also called for more help for savers, who have seen their incomes eroded by "cripplingly unfair" low interest rates since 2008. He urged the Bank of England to raise interest rates to "normal levels", which he suggested were between 3% and 5%, as soon as was economically feasible. He also advised his party against "personal attacks" on UKIP, suggesting many of their supporters were natural Conservatives who were "patriotic Britons" who felt "bewildered" by the pace of social change. The speech is his second intervention in contemporary politics in a matter of weeks, after his call earlier this month for a windfall tax on energy profits in the event of a harsh winter and a warning about hidden "lace curtain poverty". The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson said he did not believe the comments were an attack on the current Conservative leadership but a plea for those from modest backgrounds to have more say in public life. The former prime minister, Nick Robinson added, was speaking up for what he regarded as his party's natural constituency, the hard-working but aspiring majority who were not well-off. Downing Street rejected any suggestions of a rift with Sir John, saying Mr Cameron spoke to his predecessor "pretty regularly". And the prime minister said initiatives such as the help-to-buy scheme - which is designed to encourage lenders to offer mortgages to people with deposits as low as 5% on homes worth up to £600,000 - was all about promoting social mobility. Figures show 2,384 people, the majority first-time buyers, have applied for loans under the scheme in its first month. "Without this help to buy, we were beginning to see a country where only people who had wealthy mums and dads, who could give them the money for the deposit were able to buy a flat or a house," Mr Cameron said. For Labour, Kevin Brennan, shadow schools minister, said Sir John was "telling people what they already knew", saying the government was "out of touch" with "the next generation being locked out of opportunity". The UK Independence Party said the Conservatives were as much to blame as Labour for the social and educational imbalance at the top of British institutions. UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: "The abolition of selective education in Britain has been a hammer blow to the prospects of working class kids. Until we see a grammar school back in every town and city across the UK, Britain's shocking lack of social mobility will go on." </body>

      <body>Almost two thirds (60%) of UK employers feel the UK government does not do enough to support skills education. Nearly three quarters (72%) said they viewed vocational qualifications as essential for preparing young people for work. Over 1,000 employers were quizzed for qualification provider City and Guilds and skills charity Edge Foundation. The government said its reforms to apprenticeships were putting "employers in the driving seat". Researchers questioned recruitment managers at a range of small, medium and large businesses in a variety of sectors across the UK. Over half (53%) said they valued vocational qualifications in prospective employees above academic attainment. Some 78% agreed that young people who preferred practical learning need a better alternative route to A-levels. An overwhelming 83% said young people needed better advice on the career options open to them. Some 84% also agreed that pupils needed more robust work experience while they were still at school. The survey findings echo widespread concerns that vocational education can too often be of low quality, too short and fail to lead to jobs or further study. More than two years ago a review of vocational qualifications by Prof Alison Wolf recommended an wholesale overhaul. And last year a review of apprenticeships for the government by entrepreneur Doug Richard recommended that they should last for at least a year and genuinely prepare trainees in a new role. Earlier this year the Confederation of British Industry criticised the education system for continuing to focus teenagers on the "default" university route which, it said, would fail to close the UK's "chronic skills gaps". Research for qualification provider City and Guilds this month found that half of businesses thought that the current education failed to meet their needs, while a third had considered recruiting skilled workers from abroad. The government has embarked on a range of changes to vocational education and training in schools, colleges and work-places. A spokeswoman for the Department of Business Innovation and Skills said: "Apprenticeships are a proven vocational route to a successful career. "We have set out a clear and coherent set of reforms to apprenticeships. "We will continue to increase quality, simplify the system and put employers in the driving seat. "More than 60 employers from eight different sectors have already signed up to develop new standards as part of the first Apprenticeship Trailblazers. "We will work with more businesses and sectors over the coming months to develop concise employer-led standards for apprenticeships." The spokeswoman added that the government's new traineeships would help 16- to 24-year-olds improve their English and maths and to gain work skills and experience. Jan Hodges, of the Edge Foundation, said it was refreshing to hear how highly employers of all sizes rated vocational education. "We have skills gaps emerging in many sectors within the UK and it is crucial that young people are given the right training and encouragement to be able to fill these gaps." Chris Jones, chief executive of City and Guilds, said "In recent years society has placed too much emphasis on academia. "Employers are crying out for young people who have the right skills to add value to their business. "Vocational qualifications can provide these skills - but how many people know about them? "Careers advice provision in schools is limited, uninspiring and often purely focused on university." </body>

      <title>Children in care risk exploitation</title>
      <description>Children who are moved from area to area while in care risk sexual exploitation and poor support, a charity warns.</description>

      <body>Children who are moved from area to area while in care risk sexual exploitation as well as miss out on adequate education, health care and support, a charity has warned. Tros Gynnal Plant said some children get moved to new local authority areas. But it said councils often did not follow procedures to inform the child's new local authority of the move. The body which represents social services managers denied children got lost within the system. More than a quarter of the 5,900 children in care in Wales live outside the county that is responsible for them, sometimes because it is safer but often because of a shortage of foster care placements. When youngsters are moved out of their county, the council moving them should inform the new local authority and the two should work together to meet the child's needs. But in 2012-13 there were at least 60 cases where local authorities failed to share the details of children moving into their area. A BBC Wales investigation found councils often flouted Welsh government guidance on children in care. Only three kept the information and another 19 authorities did not record the information. Some councils said it would only know a child was moving to its area if it was told by the placing authority. Jackie Murphy, executive director of Tros Gynnal Plant, said in reality the numbers ignoring the guidance could be higher. "There's a lot of evidence to suggest that they're more at risk and very vulnerable," she said. "A lot of the time they're placed in private residential homes or schools. Again, we know that often these establishments are targeted by paedophiles. "Young people and peer groups just want to be accepted and be with young people so I think they can be very vulnerable." A disproportionate number of children in care were targeted by paedophile gangs in cases in Rochdale, Derby and Oxford, according to a UK government report. One of the five victims of the grooming network in Rochdale had been placed in a residential care home in the town by another local authority. The Gwent Missing Children Project is addressing the issue in a trial involving police and social and healthcare workers. Service manager Kerry Wade said: "It's helped hugely with child sexual exploitation and trafficking in Gwent. It's about everyone knowing what they need to know about that child. "We don't need to know everything about that child and it wouldn't be nice. "I wouldn't want everyone knowing my history, it's not nice for everyone to know. We need what we need to protect the child effectively." A UK government report last year said cross-boundary placements put a huge distance between the child and the social worker responsible for them, meaning they spend less time with the youngster. Ms Murphy said independent, professional advocacy could help. "Children and young people tell us time and time again that it helps them make sense of the system, that it's helped have a voice in the systems - that it helps them understand what's happening to them," she said. "Certainly it makes them feel in more control of their lives and it makes them feel listened to and not invisible." The Association of Directors for Social Services Cymru said a "minority" of children were placed outside their local authority. "It is an important decision in a child's life and, because children living away from their home area can be more vulnerable, there are strong safeguards to ensure that any risks are identified and tackled," said a spokesperson. "Regulations require the placing local authority to notify the receiving or host local authority that the placement is planned or has been made." But the association admitted there was "inconsistency in practice" adding: "The statutory responsibility for each child or young person still rests with the home (placing) local authority, regardless of where the placement is made. "These responsibilities include ensuring that all education, health and social care needs are appropriately met in line with the child's care plan and that there are regular visits to the child within the placement and to the carers. "It is not correct to state that children placed in other local authorities are 'lost' within the system or neglected." </body>

NUS Scotland and Unison said several institutions have staff earning what they described as "poverty pay". They want all staff paid at least £7.65 an hour. Universities said they were committed to offering their employees an attractive employment package and wage. The two unions made a series of Freedom of Information (FoI) requests. The living wage, promoted by the Living Wage Foundation, is an informal benchmark based on the amount an individual needs to earn to cover the basic costs of living. It is distinct from the legally-binding minimum wage. Across the UK, the TUC estimates the Treasury would save £3.3bn if all workers were paid a living wage. However, many employers argue they could not afford to pay all staff at that level. The unions said a minimum of 483 people employed directly by universities and 226 people employed by colleges in Scotland are paid less than the living wage. At the time of the unions' FoI requests the living wage was £7.45 an hour - it has since increased by 20p to £7.65 - while the legally-binding minimum wage increased last month to £6.31 an hour. However, some institutions were not paying far below the living wage. The University of the West of Scotland, for example, had 178 staff on less than the living wage - but nobody was earning below £7.39 an hour. Just three institutions had workers earning less than £7 an hour and only Abertay University appeared to have any staff earning the minimum wage. More than 400 companies and organisations across the UK are now officially accredited Living Wage Employers, and the Scottish government recently announced their support for the Living Wage accreditation scheme in Scotland. NUS Scotland and Unison Scotland welcomed that decision and are now calling on every university and college in Scotland to become accredited Living Wage employers. Sinead Wylie, NUS Scotland vice president, said: "It's important to recognise the college and universities throughout Scotland that pay their employees a living wage. "However, as we saw through recent strike action, far too many staff at Scotland's universities and colleges do not receive a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. "We need to ensure that we eliminate poverty pay rates at our colleges and universities. Higher wages are fed back into our economy and represent a significant saving to taxpayers, who otherwise subsidise low-paying employers through in-work benefits and tax credits." Dave Watson, Unison Scotland organiser, said: "Universities and colleges should be beacons of excellence, not the home of poverty pay. "Almost all the public sector in Scotland has recognised the value of the Scottish Living Wage - colleges and universities have an important role in promoting best practice into the wider community." Pay and conditions at universities are set across the UK by the Universities and Colleges Employers Association. Pay varies across Scotland's colleges, although there are moves towards returning to a national pay structure. Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK said: "Universities are committed to offering their employees an attractive employment package and wage. "Universities have few problems recruiting and retaining staff at the lower levels of the pay spine. This is in large part due to the excellent benefits package offered, particularly when compared with other local employers. "The Living Wage is an important benchmark but does not recognise the full breadth of employment benefits enjoyed by staff in the higher education sector. Benefits include a generous pension scheme, excellent sickness and maternity pay and above average holiday entitlement." Two weeks ago thousands of university staff across the UK took a day's strike action in a row over pay. It centres around the trade unions' refusal to accept a 1% pay offer, which they say contributes to a real-terms pay cut of 13% since 2008. The University and College Union (UCU) said the report was a timely reminder of the discrepancies between the pay of those at the top and the rest of staff in universities. UCU's Scotland Official, Mary Senior, said: "Staff in our universities have suffered real-terms pay cuts year after year, while those at the top have continued to enjoy rises. "This report exposes the unfairness of pay rises for university principals when some staff are not even paid the living wage. "We hope the employers' representatives will take note of this report and understand the anger staff feel at the pay injustices in higher education." </body>

      <title>Academies rapped over standards</title>
      <description>The Department for Education warns 17 academies over the standards of education they are providing.</description>

      <body>A minister has warned 17 academies over the standards of education they are providing. The formal warning letters, issued since the start of this term, call for the schools to improve or face intervention. Five of the warnings were for schools in one academy chain, AET, which was prevented from further expansion earlier this year. All the schools warned may be put under new management unless they improve. Academies are state-funded but privately run schools. And the 912 sponsored academies, as they are known, are schools that have previously been struggling and have been handed over to education trusts to run with a view to improving them in a short space of time They are different from the 2,532 converter academies which tend to be higher achieving schools who have chosen to convert to academy status. Pre-warning letters, as they are called, are part of the process by which action is taken on sponsored academies which are not improving as well as they should. The standards of education they are providing are considered to be unacceptably low. The letters, all from junior education minister Lord Nash and his predecessor Lord Hill, appeared on a government website alongside 17 other older pre-warning and warning letters requiring academies to improve. This other batch related to the academic years 2011-12 and 2012-13 and have already been published, the Department for Education said. A DfE spokesman said: "The majority of sponsored academies are thriving under great leadership. Their GCSE results are improving far faster than in other state-funded secondary schools. "This is despite sponsored academies taking over from schools that were consistently underperforming, which can take time to reverse. "But results in a minority of sponsored academies remain stubbornly low. We will not tolerate long-term underperformance in any school - including in an academy. "That is why this government issues pre-warning letters and warning notices. The evidence shows that academies respond well to these warnings, achieving on average much better GCSE results afterwards. "However, as with maintained schools, if these academies still do not make the progress we expect, we will take further action. This may result in a change to the sponsorship arrangements." The Academies Enterprise Trust said it was acting to ensure a rapid and sustained improvement in the schools. A spokesman said: "The AET academies listed by the department have a history of underperformance and have been with AET only for a short time. Many of these schools have a significantly higher proportion of special educational needs and Pupil Premium pupils than the national average. Many of our pupils start life in our schools with attainment levels well below the national average for their age. "Our response to these challenges is to set ambitious targets for the progress that we expect pupils to make. Our culture of high aspirations is reflected in significant improvements in test and examination results across the board in the 21 primary and 24 secondary academies open for the full 2012-13 academic year." The news comes after the Education Select Committee called for academy chains to face inspections from Ofsted. </body>

      <title>More top graduates train as teachers</title>
      <description>The proportion of trainee teachers with top degrees rose to an unprecedented level in 2011-12, official data suggests.</description>

      <body>The proportion of trainee teachers with top degrees rose to an unprecedented level in 2011-12, according to the latest official figures. Two-thirds of postgraduate trainees in 2011-12 had a first or a 2:1, data from the Department for Education suggests. This was a rise of three percentage points on 2010-11. Teaching unions welcomed the figures but said the overall picture on teacher recruitment was patchy, with evidence of shortages in some areas. However Charlie Taylor, chief executive of the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said the figures were extremely good news. "Children deserve excellent teachers and today's statistics show the profession is attracting more of the country's top-tier graduates," said Mr Taylor. Some 12% of postgraduate trainees, more than 3,000, had a first class degree, up two percentage points on the year before. And the proportion of those with a 2:1 was 55% or almost 15,000 - up one percentage point. There was a two percentage point fall in the proportion of those with a 2:2 - to 27.4% or 7,450 trainees - and a very slight drop in those with third class degrees, the government says. Overall, 32,900 trainee teachers completed their courses in 2011-12. Of these 27,144 were postgraduates. The figures also showed a rise in the number of newly qualified teachers getting jobs within six months of qualifying. Of those whose employment status was known, some 91% had secured a job by January 2012 - a rise of at least 5% on 2010-11. "Schools recognise this increase in quality and more trainee teachers are finding jobs quickly," said Mr Taylor. The figures combine data on the numbers of teachers trained by universities, from the Higher Education Statistics Agency, as well as figures for non-university trainees collected directly from training providers by the National College for Training and Leadership. These figures pre-date the government's School Direct programme which began the following year. School Direct is designed to boost the numbers of teachers trained directly by schools with support from universities. Some experts have raised concerns that the picture from more recent years may be of emerging shortages of teachers in some areas. Brian Lightman of the Association of School and College leaders described the increases in the number of trainees with good degrees as "very good news". "However, there are still issues with certain subjects and in certain areas of the country. "Many schools report that they are struggling to recruit high quality teachers in core subjects, especially maths, English and science. "With the recent changes to initial teacher training, the big picture about where the gaps are has been lost." "It must be a priority for the government to reinstate a national strategy for ensuring that there are sufficient numbers of high quality teaching graduates coming through in every subject." Chris Keates of the NASUWT teaching union said the increase in the proportion of trainee teachers with top degrees began "long before this government took office". "Today's figures simply confirm the continuation of this long-term trend and reflect continuing increases in the proportion of 2:1 and first degrees awarded by higher education institutions." Ms Keates added preliminary figures for the following year suggested a fall in the number of applicants for teacher training places of "almost 15%" in 2012. "Concerns expressed by teachers, school leaders and training providers that the teacher training system is heading towards crisis continue to be ignored by ministers. "The adverse implications of the DfE's policies on pay, conditions and professional status are undermining the attractiveness of teaching and placing the sufficient supply of high quality graduate teachers at serious risk." </body>

      <title>11-plus coaching culture 'must end'</title>
      <description>An educational charity says the culture of coaching pupils for 11-plus exams must end so poor bright children are not excluded from grammar schools.</description>

      <body>The culture of coaching pupils for 11-plus exams must be ended so poor bright children are not excluded from grammar schools, an educational charity says. The Sutton Trust says grammar school entrance tests should also be changed regularly so they are tutor-proof. It urges grammar schools to offer test preparation classes to all candidates, so there is a "more level playing field" between rich and poor pupils. The government gives extra money to schools with disadvantaged pupils. The report, Poor Grammar: Entry into Grammar Schools for Disadvantaged Pupils in England, says pupils from very low income families are outnumbered by four to one in grammar schools by children from fee-paying prep schools. It found only 2.7% of grammar school entrants were from families who qualified for free school meals, while 12.7% came from outside England's state sector - mainly independent schools. Overall in England about 20% of pupils are on free school meals. It is well known that many children from affluent homes are coached for entrance tests, with private tutors offering expensive coaching services particularly in areas where grammar schools are high achieving but few in number. The report also suggested that many parents were using the private preparatory school route to get their children through grammar school doors. Those on lower incomes are less likely to be able to afford to pay for tutoring or private education. Grammars that stand alone, rather than in a wholly selective authority such as Buckinghamshire or Kent, draw pupils from a wide geographical area. This is also true of London grammars which have wide catchment areas, with sometimes 10 or 11 candidates for every place. The competition for places is very intense and not just based on passing the 11-plus but getting the highest marks. The report called for these high achieving schools to increase outreach work "significantly". This could mean such schools encouraging low and middle income households to apply and doing more to dispel the the view that some parents may have of them as "elitist", it said. It even suggests giving priority to poor, bright pupils who meet certain entrance requirements and are eligible for the pupil premium because their families have been in receipt of certain benefits in the previous few years. And once tests are reformed, it suggests children should be provided with at least 10 hours free, or subsidised preparation for entrance tests, so applicants from all backgrounds are given an even chance of success. Sutton Trust chairman Sir Peter Lampl said: "Politicians of all parties have accepted that grammar schools are here to stay, and while their numbers are not growing, the number of pupils admitted to them has risen by a quarter, or 30,000, since 1997 and is likely to continue to grow in the years ahead. "Some grammar schools are working to improve access, and grammar schools in Northern Ireland have a far better record than English grammar schools." In his foreword to the report, he said: "The challenge to the sector and for those areas where a selective system prevails is how to ensure that those grammar schools are open to all, and are not simply a preserve of better-off families who can afford private tutors or prep schools fees." He added: "We need fairer tests and there should be a minimum of 10 hours free or subsidised test preparation for all applicants to provide a more level playing field." But National Grammar Schools Association chairman Robert McCartney said the fact that three-quarters of England had no grammar school meant that it was not fair to compare national figures on pupils on free school meals. He added that the report makes clear that grammar schools are a good thing and they are not going to go away. "Clearly since 1997 there have been an additional 30,000 pupils at the 164 grammar schools in England. That really means something like an extra 30 grammar schools with pupils of 1,000 each." He welcomed the idea that grammar schools provide test preparation classes to all pupils, but said it was impossible to design a written test that was not amenable to coaching. However, he agreed that many pupils found their way into grammar schools because they had been heavily coached for the tests. He added: "Grammar school heads report that many pupils have been totally over-coached and begin to struggle further up the school." He said the reason that this coaching industry had come about was because of the "paucity of grammar school places in England". The Department for Education did not wish to comment on the report. </body>

      <title>'Student fees may reach £20,000'</title>
      <description>Some universities may charge students from England up to £20,000 a year, a vice-chancellor tells the Times Higher Education magazine.</description>

      <body>Some universities may eventually charge students from England up to £20,000 a year, a vice-chancellor has told the Times Higher Education magazine. Tuition fees paid by home students at English institutions are capped at £9,000, overseas students pay more. The sector may start to see both groups the same way, says Prof Nick Petford, of Northampton University His comments come as a report argues that universities will need more money to cope as demand for places rises. The report, published on Thursday by the umbrella group Universities UK (UUK), says that higher fees charged by universities since last year have merely replaced cuts to government funding. Some forecasts predict that the number of university places needed will grow from 368,000 to 460,000 within the next 20 years. The report says this means institutions will need extra money to invest in buildings and facilities if they are to compete with universities in other countries. Many universities are already relying on sources of income other than fees or government money to pay for new building projects, it says. Prof Petford is the third university vice-chancellor to argue that the cap on annual fees, currently set at a maximum of £9,000, will need to rise. Last week UUK president and Surrey University vice-chancellor Sir Christopher Snowden urged the government to allow fees to keep pace with inflation. In September the vice-chancellor of Oxford University, Prof Andrew Hamilton, said fees should be related to the true cost of a degree - or £16,000 in the case of Oxford. Both said that some universities and departments were losing money, particularly on expensive courses such as science, technology or engineering. Prof Petford argues that some universities "with high brand value will be able to charge £17,000, £18,000 or £20,000 in the future - I am sure of that". "If you look at international students that's been a pretty much unregulated market since we've been recruiting overseas students," he said. "Universities have always been used to this sort of behaviour. "The big step change now is thinking about home students in this way." He agrees that universities could increasingly find themselves short of cash if the government maintains the £9,000 cap on fees. "It is quite easy to do a financial forecast which shows that if the cap remains at £9,000 in the next decade, a number of universities, including ours, could potentially be in financial difficulty." Prof Petford acknowledges it would not be easy for any political party to adopt a tuition fee rise as policy in the run-up to the next election. He said: "As a vote winner, it's just not going to work is it?" Any change in tuition fees would have to be agreed by Parliament. The Department for Business Innovation and Skills maintains that the current £9,000 maximum fee allows universities to deliver high-quality teaching and to invest in improved teaching facilities, while ensuring that going to university remains affordable for students. </body>

      <title>Global tests for schools in England</title>
      <description>Secondary schools in England will be able to compare their standards with top Asian countries, as individual schools are able to take international Pisa tests.</description>

      <body>Individual secondary schools in England will be able to take influential international tests to see how they compare with the highest performing schools in Asia and Europe. OECD Pisa tests are used to measure and compare the educational standards of developed countries around the world. But from next year individual schools will be able to test their 15-year-old pupils in reading, maths and science. It will allow schools to see how their pupils rank against global standards. Education Minister Liz Truss said it was an "excellent opportunity for schools to compare themselves against the world's best education systems". Essex County Council said it is encouraging its schools to take part. Next month will see the publication of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) international league tables, based on Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests. These performance tables, which have become important international benchmarks, are published every three years, based on tests taken by a sample of schools in each country. The OECD says that such school standards are an important indicator for future economic performance. Asian countries have dominated the top places in recent test results, with Scandinavian countries among the high flyers in Europe. The UK has been a middle ranking performer, but within this national figure there will be a wide range of differences in ability, depending on region and type of school. It has raised questions such as how cities such as London might compare with New York or Paris, if there was data beyond the national level. The OECD is now going to allow individual schools in England to take the tests, so that they can see whether they are as good as pupils in Shanghai, Hong Kong or Finland, or whether they are falling behind the global competition. Making the test available will "enable individual schools in England for the first time to see where they stand internationally", says the OECD's education chief, Andreas Schleicher. "This will help teachers and school leaders understand where to focus their efforts to raise standards and learn from successful school systems in other countries." Schools will be given an overall test score, rather than a breakdown of individual pupils. And the school scores, from tests that take about two and a half hours, will not be published by the OECD. The test papers will be marked externally. Earlier this year this type of individual school testing was announced for the United States. Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said: "It is down to secondary schools themselves to decide whether they want to take part in these tests run by a highly respected, independent organisation. "We see this is an excellent opportunity for schools to compare themselves against the world's best education systems - and potentially against other schools from around the world." Ray Gooding, Essex County Council's cabinet member for education, said: "I will actively be encouraging Essex schools to take part to benefit from the ability to assess performance, share best practice and improve learning across the county." </body>

      <body>Many parents fear music videos have become too sexualised and violent, the founder of a parenting website has said. Siobhan Freegard, of Netmums, said parents were not prudes, but felt things had "gone too far". In a survey of some 1,500 website members, most (82%) said their children had repeated sexual lyrics without knowing their meaning. And three-quarters said they tried to stop children watching music videos. Ms Freegard said parents were most angry that their children were being exposed to "lewd viewing" on programmes shown before the 21:00 watershed for family viewing. "Modern parents aren't prudes - they know sex sells," she said. "But there's a strong feeling that things have gone too far now. It's toxic to tell young kids casual sex and violence are something to aspire to." Most (75%) of parents with daughters said very sexual pop acts were teaching girls they would be "judged on their looks, not their achievements or personality". About half of parents with sons said they were frightened explicit footage made them believe women were "too sexually available" and that they should have "unrealistic porn-star-style body shapes". About 1,500 members of the website opted to take part in the online survey last month, shortly after an outcry over the latest music video and performances by Miley Cyrus. The Irish singer Sinead O'Connor recently warned the former children's TV star not to let herself be exploited by the music business, sparking a row between the pair. Two-thirds of parents taking part said they thought young female singers were being exploited. Defending a recent controversial performance, Miley Cyrus said people were "over-thinking" what she had done and that she had been trying to "make history". </body>

      <description>A female drama teacher is banned from teaching after asking a pupil for sex and having 'inappropriate and sexually explicit' conversations with other children.</description>

      <body>A female drama teacher has been banned from teaching after asking a pupil for sex. Lindsay Black, 28, sent texts, emails and Facebook messages to the boy, 17, who played a lead role in the school play "We Will Rock You". She asked him to meet up for sex after class at St Joseph's Roman Catholic High School, Newport. The disciplinary panel in Cardiff heard she had "inappropriate and sexually explicit" talks with other pupils. Miss Black asked her sixth form class "Who's a virgin?" and made pupils stand-up if they had not had sex. She also played a game called "I have never" with the pupils where she would ask them if they had performed sex acts. The hearing was told Miss Black then encouraged the teenagers to mime sex acts in class. The schoolboy, known as Pupil A, showed other pupils text messages from Miss Black as he rehearsed. English teacher Abigail Watts said: "I heard comments from other pupils about Miss Black liking pupils and I asked what this meant. "They said she had been Facebook messaging Pupil A - she told him she had a dream about them having sex. "They had not met up but they had been talking about it." Trained actress Miss Black met the teenager while working on maternity cover at the school. She contacted him on Facebook and asked about his coursework, then began sending him messages talking about sex and alcohol. A Professional Conduct Committee of the General Teaching Council of Wales heard she even asked the boy's girlfriend about their relationship. The hearing was told how Miss Black would spend time in classes talking to the students about sex acts. When Miss Black was confronted by the head of drama she told him it was just an exercise to get them into "character". Colleague Sandra Davies said: "Pupils told me that during drama classes Miss Black would talk about sex and she turned the lessons on to a sexual theme. "She said she wanted to cheat on her fiance once before getting married and that she fantasised about having sex on a table in the drama class." Ms Davies added the pupils played the "I have never" game. "She would then get the pupils to act out the acts in question," she added. The hearing in Cardiff was told how the boy's academic performance had suffered as a result of the messages and he had to re-sit his AS levels. Ms Black was interviewed by police following the allegations in 2011 but no further action was taken. She did not attend the hearing but admitted engaging in inappropriate and sexually explicit conversations with a pupil via social networking website Facebook. Ms Black denied talking to her class about sex and said the pupils had made up the allegations. But the panel found she had held discussions of an "inappropriate and sexually explicit nature" with Year 12 children. The panel found her actions amounted to unacceptable professional conduct and banned her from teaching. Committee chairman Peter Williams said: "The conduct in question seriously affected pupils and was not an isolated lapse. "Black's actions are fundamentally incompatible with being a registered teacher." Paul Bennett, chair of governors at St Joseph's, said the school took allegations of unprofessional conduct "very seriously". He added: "The allegations were handled in line with the appropriate procedures. The school referred the matter to the General Teaching Council for Wales as it was required to do." </body>

      <body>This is the biggest education provider you've never heard of. Until now. The Alison project - Advanced Learning Interactive Systems Online - has already signed up more than two million students to more than 500 online courses. It's adding another 200,000 each month and founder Mike Feerick is confident this expansion could accelerate even more rapidly and reach a billion students towards the end of the decade. But this ambitious project isn't another Silicon Valley spin-off, fuelled by venture capital and a surfeit of sunshine and flow charts. This global digital empire is based in a technology park in Galway in the west of Ireland. If there was such a thing as successful grey skies thinking, on a damp autumn day, this would be a prime location. But Alison's days in the shade could be numbered, as it has won a prestigious international award this week at the World Innovation Summit for Education in Qatar. The online learning platform has already won an innovation award from Unesco. So how has it stayed below the radar? While the new wave of online courses - so-called Moocs, such as Coursera and edX, have become darlings of the digital media, why has Alison not had the same attention? Mr Feerick says the big difference is who they are trying to reach. It's the academic versus vocational divide being played out in the digital market. "The people we're helping do not have a huge voice," says Mr Feerick. While the Moocs are associated with high-status universities, Alison's focus is on the vast numbers of people around the world needing to improve their vocational skills and training. There are courses in subjects such as computer skills, learning English, basic accountancy, building a website, food safety, immunology, introductions to legal studies. He is planning to expand into secondary school level, with video lessons customised for national exam systems, beginning with maths. Organisations from the IMF to the OECD to the European Union have all spoken of the urgency of providing vocational, workplace skills to tackle dangerously high levels of youth unemployment. But Alison has been putting this into practice. A deal struck earlier this year will provide online training for 12 million young people in the Arab world. Many of those accessing the free courses are at the margins of formal education - low-skilled workers, the unemployed and immigrants. Within the coming months, India is expected to become the biggest source of learners, overtaking the UK and US. Nigeria and the Philippines are rapidly growing markets. Mr Feerick wants to use online technology to offer free lessons in the most important basic skills that people need. As he puts it, 99% of the people are learning the same 1% of information, again and again. His other challenge to the established order, heresy to some, is to question the necessity of exam certificates. If people are studying for a specific skill, such as learning to touch-type or a language, he argues the key question is whether they can put the lessons into practice. He says the fixation with a paper trail of certification is part of protecting an educational status quo. "They desperately want to keep the same system." Alison's other big difference is that it is profitable. The courses are free because of advertising revenue. The social mission is underpinned by a strong business sense. Mr Feerick says his approach to social entrepreneurship was influenced by his own business mentor, Chuck Feeney, a celebrated US investor in ideas and education, who took him under his wing when Mr Feerick had been studying at Harvard. Mr Feeney is a famously frugal and publicity-shy billionaire and philanthropist, who is currently helping to fund New York's hi-tech science campus. Inspired by his example, Mr Feerick says he wanted to combine thinking big commercially while maintaining a sense of social purpose. The idea of free education online, available around the globe, became his focus. "Education underpins all social progress. It's the tool of the most ambitious revolutionary in these technological times, you can change the world if you can change education." He sees the internet as making an irresistible impact on education, in the way it has in other industries, with a few giants emerging to dominate the multi-trillion dollar education market. "There is going to be huge consolidation worldwide into a small number of platforms for learning, because it's going to be very hard to compete with them," he predicts, likening it to how Amazon has become the global bookseller. "So these platforms are going to be huge, some of the biggest and most valuable companies in the world." There are other projects challenging the idea that online learning should be dominated by prestigious Western universities. The Kepler project, launched in September, is using online technology to bring university lessons to Rwanda, to students who otherwise would have no chance of getting into higher education. Using laptops they can take lectures and resources from top universities putting course material online. In the Rwandan campus there are local teachers who are able to provide face-to-face lessons, with a ratio of 30 students for each member of staff. If they successfully complete their course they can get a US accredited degree. There are 50 students in a pilot phase, being charged $1,000 per year. If it works, this will expand rapidly and the longer-term aim is to reach 7,000 to 10,000 students. "There is a rising demand for higher education in Africa that can't be met by traditional models," says Jamie Hodari, chief executive of the non-profit organisation. The economy in Rwanda is growing, but if it wants to compete with other countries it is severely limited by low levels of education. "They have completely hit a wall," says Mr Hodari. Rwanda has ambitions to become a regional technology hub, but it lacks a supply of suitably-qualified graduates. At present, Mr Hodari says "so many children leave as the top of their class and go on to become taxi drivers, because there is no other pathway". The Kepler idea reflects the way that technology is dismantling the component parts of education - separating the local teaching from the online course materials and the international accreditation. If the format works, Mr Hodari says it could be replicated in other parts of Africa and beyond. It could be a "university in a box" that others could copy, he says. "The playbook will be right there in front of them." </body>

      <body>The music of ancient Greece, unheard for thousands of years, is being brought back to life by Armand D'Angour, a musician and tutor in classics at Oxford University. He describes what his research is discovering. "Suppose that 2,500 years from now all that survived of the Beatles songs were a few of the lyrics, and all that remained of Mozart and Verdi's operas were the words and not the music. Imagine if we could then reconstruct the music, rediscover the instruments that played them, and hear the words once again in their proper setting, how exciting that would be. This is about to happen with the classic texts of ancient Greece. It is often forgotten that the writings at the root of Western literature - the epics of Homer, the love-poems of Sappho, the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides - were all, originally, music. Dating from around 750 to 400 BC, they were composed to be sung in whole or part to the accompaniment of the lyre, reed-pipes, and percussion instruments. But isn't the music lost beyond recovery? The answer is no. The rhythms - perhaps the most important aspect of music - are preserved in the words themselves, in the patterns of long and short syllables. The instruments are known from descriptions, paintings and archaeological remains, which allow us to establish the timbres and range of pitches they produced. And now, new revelations about ancient Greek music have emerged from a few dozen ancient documents inscribed with a vocal notation devised around 450 BC, consisting of alphabetic letters and signs placed above the vowels of the Greek words. The Greeks had worked out the mathematical ratios of musical intervals - an octave is 2:1, a fifth 3:2, a fourth 4:3, and so on. The notation gives an accurate indication of relative pitch: letter A at the top of the scale, for instance, represents a musical note a fifth higher than N halfway down the alphabet. Absolute pitch can be worked out from the vocal ranges required to sing the surviving tunes. While the documents, found on stone in Greece and papyrus in Egypt, have long been known to classicists - some were published as early as 1581 - in recent decades they have been augmented by new finds. Dating from around 300 BC to 300 AD, these fragments offer us a clearer view than ever before of the music of ancient Greece. The research project that I have embarked on, funded by the British Academy, has the aim of bringing this music back to life. But it is important to realise that ancient rhythmical and melodic norms were different from our own. We must set aside our Western preconceptions. A better parallel is non-Western folk traditions, such as those of India and the Middle East. Instrumental practices that derive from ancient Greek traditions still survive in areas of Sardinia and Turkey, and give us an insight into the sounds and techniques that created the experience of music in ancient times. So what did Greek music sound like? Some of the surviving melodies are immediately attractive to a modern ear. One complete piece, inscribed on a marble column and dating from around 200 AD, is a haunting short song of four lines composed by Seikilos. The words of the song may be translated: While you're alive, shine: never let your mood decline. We've a brief span of life to spend: Time necessitates an end. The notation is unequivocal. It marks a regular rhythmic beat, and indicates a very important principle of ancient composition. In ancient Greek the voice went up in pitch on certain syllables and fell on others (the accents of ancient Greek indicate pitch, not stress). The contours of the melody follow those pitches here, and fairly consistently in all the documents. But one shouldn't assume that the Greeks' idea of tuning was identical to ours. Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD provides precise mathematical ratios for numerous different scale-tunings, including one that he says sounds "foreign and homespun". Dr David Creese of the University of Newcastle has constructed an eight-string "canon" (a zither-like instrument) with movable bridges. When he plays two versions of the Seikilos tune using Ptolemy's tunings, the second immediately strikes us as exotic, more like Middle Eastern than Western music. The earliest musical document that survives preserves a few bars of sung music from a play, Orestes by the fifth-century BC tragedian Euripides. It may even be music Euripides himself wrote. Music of this period used subtle intervals such as quarter-tones. We also find that the melody doesn't conform to the word pitches at all. Euripides was a notoriously avant-garde composer, and this indicates one of the ways in which his music was heard to be wildly modern: it violated the long-held norms of Greek folk singing by neglecting word-pitch. However, we can recognise that Euripides adopted another principle. The words "I lament" and "I beseech" are set to a falling, mournful-sounding cadence; and when the singer says "my heart leaps wildly", the melody leaps as well. This was ancient Greek soundtrack music. And it was received with great excitement in the Greek world. The historian Plutarch tells a moving story about the thousands of Athenian soldiers held prisoner in roasting Syracusan quarries after a disastrous campaign in 413 BC. Those few who were able to sing Euripides' latest songs were able to earn some food and drink. What about the greatest of ancient poet-singers, Homer himself? Homer tells us that bards of his period sang to a four-stringed lyre, called a "phorminx". Those strings will probably have been tuned to the four notes that survived at the core of the later Greek scale systems. Professor Martin West of Oxford has reconstructed the singing of Homer on that basis. The result is a fairly monotonous tune, which probably explains why the tradition of Homeric recitation without melody emerged from what was originally a sung composition. "What song the Sirens sang," is the first of the questions listed by the 17th Century English writer, Sir Thomas Browne, as "puzzling, though not beyond all conjecture". "The reconstruction of ancient Greek music is bringing us a step closer to answering the question." </body>

      <title>Asia’s parents suffering 'education fever'</title>
      <description>Asia's 'tiger parents' paying a high price for children's future</description>

      <body>Zhang Yang, a bright 18-year old from a rural town in Anhui province in China was accepted to study at a prestigious traditional medicine college in Hefei. But the news was too much for his father Zhang Jiasheng. Zhang's father was partly paralysed after he suffered a stroke two years ago and could no longer work. He feared the family, already in debt to pay for medicines, would not be able to afford his son's tuition fees. As his son headed home to celebrate his success, Zhang Jiasheng killed himself by swallowing pesticide. Zhang's case is an extreme. But East Asian families are spending more and more of their money on securing their children the best possible education. In richer Asian countries such as South Korea and emerging countries like China, "education fever" is forcing families to make choices, sometimes dramatic ones, to afford the bills. There are families selling their apartments to raise the funds to send their children to study overseas. Andrew Kipnis, an anthropologist at Australian National University and author of a recent book on the intense desire for education in China, says the amount spent on education is "becoming extreme". It is not just middle-class families. Workers also want their children to do better than themselves and see education as the only means of ensuring social mobility. Some go deep into debt. "Families are spending less on other things. There are many cases of rural parents not buying healthcare that their doctors urge on them... Part of the reason is that they would rather spend the money on their children's education," said Mr Kipnis. "Parents may be forced to put off building a new house, which they might have been able to do otherwise," said Mr Kipnis who did the bulk of his research in Zouping district in Shandong province, among both middle-class and rural households. "It can be very intense. They often borrow from relatives. Of course some people have difficulty paying it back," said Mr Kipnis. A Euromonitor survey found that per capita annual disposable income in China rose by 63.3% in the five years to 2012, yet consumer expenditure on education rose by almost 94%. It's not just the parents' incomes. Educating a child has become an extended-family project. "It goes beyond tiger mothers, it also includes tiger grandmothers and grandfathers," said Todd Maurer, an expert on education in Asia and partner at the consultancy firm, Sinica Advisors. There is evidence of high levels of education spending in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Spending is also increasing in India and Indonesia. In South Korea, where the government believes "education obsession" is damaging society, family expenditure on education has helped push household debt to record levels. According to the LG Economic Research Institute, 28% of South Korean households cannot afford monthly loan repayments, and are hard pressed to live off their incomes. A huge proportion of that income - 70% of Korean household expenditure, according to estimates by the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul, goes toward private education, to get an educational edge over other families. Families cut back on other household spending "across the board," said Michael Seth, professor of Korean history at James Madison University in the US and author of a book on South Korea's education zeal. "There is less money to spend on other things like housing, retirement, or vacations." "Every developing country in Asia, specially China, seems to have a similar pattern," said Prof Seth. A highly competitive examination system and rising aspirations are often blamed. "The Korean education system puts enormous pressure on children," said Prof Seth." The only way to opt out of the system is not to have children. It is so expensive to educate a child that it is undoubtedly a factor in South Korea's very low birth rate," he said. The education obsession is so all consuming that the South Korean government has unsuccessfully tried to curb it, concerned about family spending on extra-curricular lessons and cram schools for ferociously competitive exams. While not yet at South Korean levels, China's education fever also puts pressure on family spending. A recent survey by market research company Mintel, found that nine out of 10 children from middle class families in China attended fee-charging after-school activities. Parents believe these activities will help their children when it comes to university entry. Children are being tutored for longer, starting younger. Where before it was for a year or two before the university entrance exam, now it can start in middle school or even primary. Matthew Crabbe, Asia research director at Mintel, says that people in China are using the savings that might have been put aside for healthcare. "But because the cost of education has risen and the competition for places at good universities have become so much more intense, they are investing more of their savings to make sure the child can get the grades they would need to get in." It does not stop there. Nearly 87% of Chinese parents said they were willing to fund study abroad. In the past an overseas education was confined to the most privileged. Now many more want foreign degrees to give them a shortcut to success. According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a third of Chinese students studying abroad in 2010 were from working-class families. This is a massive financial burden and parents may not realise the true costs. According to Zhang Jianbai who runs a private school in Yunnan province, parents in small provincial cities often sell their apartments to fund their children's study overseas. "Parents decide very early on that their children are going to go abroad and that requires quite a bit of money because [the preparation] cannot be acquired through the public education system," said Mr Maurer. It can include intensive English lessons, study tours to the US and significant payments for student recruitment agents. Last year an estimated 40,000 Chinese students travelled to Hong Kong to take the US college admissions exam, the Scholastic Assessment Test (SATS), which is not offered in mainland China. Chinese education company, New Oriental Education, organises SAT trips to Hong Kong for $1,000 (£627) on average, and parents spend up to $8,000 (£5,020) on tutoring. Once confined to affluent Beijing and Shanghai, it is an expanding market. The company expects its revenue to grow by over 40% in China's second and third tier cities. "Parents are surrendering their last resources to wager them on a child's future by sending them abroad," said Lao Kaisheng, an education policy researcher at Capital Normal University in Beijing. It means that when young people graduate there is great pressure on them to start earning. This is particularly an issue as record numbers of students graduate, seven million this year, and an overseas degree no longer has the status it had in the past. Many graduates languish in non-graduate jobs. But it is not easy to dampen education fever. In South Korea as in other East Asian countries, "it is deeply embedded in the culture. It's also based on reality that there is no alternative pathway to success or a good career other than a prestige degree, this was true 50 years ago, and it's just as true today". "As long as that's the case it's actually rational for parents to spend so much and put so much pressure on their children," said Prof Seth. </body>

      <title>Teachers in China 'highest status'</title>
      <description>Teachers in China are the most highly respected, in an international study comparing the status of teachers in 21 countries.</description>

      <body>Teachers in China have the highest levels of public respect, according to an international study comparing their status in 21 countries. Teachers in the UK were in 10th place in the global index which was compiled by the University of Sussex professor Peter Dolton. The study was based on surveys of 1,000 adults in each of the countries. This examined public attitudes to professional status, trust, pay and the desirability of teaching as a career. The study confirmed the high status of teachers in China, where there is a strong cultural emphasis on the importance of education. "Teachers are revered," says Prof Dolton. A large majority of adults in China believed that students would respect their teachers - in contrast to most European countries where only a minority believed that students would show respect. In the UK, only about one in five adults believed that students showed their teachers respect in school. And while teachers in China were compared with doctors, in the UK they were more likely to be bracketed with nurses and social workers. In the US, people compared teachers with librarians and in Japan the feeling was that they were on a par with local government officials. This reveals the cultural differences in how the role of teaching is perceived, says Prof Dolton, a professor of economics at Sussex University and senior research fellow at the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. The status of teachers in China was considerably above the next highest countries, which were Greece, Turkey and South Korea. The study, published by the Varkey GEMS Foundation, also included some results that might be thought of as unexpected. Finland, often seen as a model for recruiting high-quality, high-status teachers, was in the bottom half of the rankings, in 13th place. while Germany (16th) and Japan (17th) were ranked among the lowest countries. No countries from sub-Saharan Africa were included in the survey. The findings for the UK are based on a single national figure, rather than individual devolved administrations. They show a positive picture in public attitudes, with much higher levels of trust in the education system than in the US and most other European countries in the survey. There was a considerable level of public support for teachers - with a majority believing that they should be better paid and also underestimating the starting salary for teachers (currently about £22,000 in England outside London). More people thought that teachers' unions should have greater influence, compared with those who thought that they had too much influence. But a large majority were sympathetic to the principle of performance pay for teachers. Head teachers in the UK are particularly highly respected - more so than in any other of the countries surveyed. Former education minister, Lord Adonis, said the rankings showed the importance of the role of teaching in education reform. "To recruit the brightest and best, teaching needs to be a high status occupation, and we need to understand better what contributes to the social standing of teachers," said Lord Adonis. Sunny Varkey, founder of the Varkey GEMS Foundation, said: "It is my ambition that teachers are treated with as much respect as doctors. Sadly, in many countries around the world teachers no longer retain the elevated status that we used to take for granted." Prof Dalton says the public status of teaching will influence standards of education. "This informs who decides to become a teacher in each country, how they are respected and how they are financially rewarded. Ultimately, this affects the kind of job they do in teaching our children," he says. </body>

      <description>The tough struggle to modernise Kurdistan's education system</description>

      <body>Prof Dlawer Ala'Aldeen had tomatoes, stones and apples thrown at him. He faced countless demonstrations. The reason for this hostility, facing the microbiologist from the University of Nottingham, was his controversial attempt to reform the university system in his birthplace of Kurdistan. Prof Ala'Aldeen was the architect of plans to improve the quality and to internationalise higher education in Iraqi Kurdistan. He says he was up against "deeply entrenched interests, people, institutions and long stagnant cultures". The region, autonomous for two decades in the wake of the Gulf War, had inherited a post-Saddam university system that Prof Ala'Aldeen has described as "grossly outdated" and designed for a closed, centralised country. In 2009 Prof Ala'Aldeen was given a secondment away from his job as professor of clinical microbiology at Nottingham University in the UK. He stepped from academic life in the English midlands into the role of Kurdistan's higher education minister, a post he held until last year. Prime Minister Barham Salih, a good friend, chose him for his knowledge of the higher education system and the series of critical articles on education and governance he had written in the years up to his appointment. Barham Salih's election manifesto had included significant support for higher education and training to support Kurdistan's large population of under 20 year olds. There were already plans for more scholarships to send talented students to study overseas. Within a week of being appointed, Prof Ala'Aldeen had written up a radical vision document and it was quickly endorsed by the cabinet. Higher education in Kurdistan was suffering a major crisis of quality, capacity and infrastructure. There was a consensus in support of reform and it helped that Prof Ala'Aldeen had been very critical of the government in the past. The reforms, which planned to improve the quality and accreditation of university teachers, brought considerable opposition from student and teacher organisations as well as businesses linked with the burgeoning market in private universities. Several new private universities were threatened with closure, much to the anger of their staff and prospective students who had paid fees for their courses. "Many teachers had been licensed prematurely. There were 11 private universities when I started with 18 more waiting to be opened. These mushrooming private colleges were relying on the same pool of resources as the public universities which lacked staff and facilities," Prof Ala'Aldeen says. The problem of staffing was particularly acute in medicine, pharmacy and dentistry and in postgraduate studies. But Prof Ala'Aldeen faced protests and opposition. He was accused of trying to transplant the UK system onto Kurdistan, something he vehemently denies since he was educated and worked in his home region, before coming to study in the UK. "I knew the system from the inside and studied what had happened in similar countries. I wanted to apply international principles of quality, but tailor-made to Kurdish traditions," he says. He responded by redoubling his efforts to communicate the purpose of the reforms, which also included curriculum development, moving beyond a single teacher delivering a lecture to a class, the introduction of an electronic admissions system and reforming the teaching of PhDs. In the end, the government closed three private universities as well as five health-related colleges, three pharmacy colleges and two dentistry ones. "If we had allowed the system to keep evolving as it was it would have taken at least a generation to fix it - a generation would have been wasted. We knew we had to act fast. It was a risky policy, but it would have been far riskier to do nothing," he says. The speed of his action was criticised as were aspects of the efforts to improve teaching standards, such as student feedback being used to measure teacher performance and pay. There was also opposition to teachers being asked to engage in professional development once a week. Prof Brendan O'Leary, director of the programme in ethnic conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a longer process might have worked better. But he says it was against a background when unprecedented changes were happening in Kurdish society as the region opened up to foreign investment. "The Kurdistan region is going through a difficult and fast-paced transformation. "Ideally a long and rich discussion is needed to agree new institutional conditions to enable higher education to flourish in a region emerging from decades of destruction, war, genocide, internal fighting, academic isolation and lack of resources. "University and institutional reforms are more likely to succeed if all the stakeholders have clear ideas on what to do, when, and at what pace. One should not be surprised if people with vested interests fear reforms," said Prof O'Leary. Thomas Hill, assistant professor at New York University Center for Global Affairs, adds: "I do not believe there is consensus even now that the reforms the former minister wanted to implement would have been in the best interest of the Kurdistan region. "There are many, many people with very conservative views within the higher education sector in the Kurdistan region and many did not and do not like the progressive path the former minister was plotting." There were areas in which vested interests remained unmoved. Prof Ala'Aldeen could not increase the independence of universities. The government continues to choose university leaders and universities have been totally dependent on government funding. Prof Ala'Aldeen put together draft legislation on institutional autonomy, but says the challenge to the status quo was too great to push it through. He is in close touch with the current government and is pleased that the reforms to improve quality have been maintained, despite the fact that there is still not consensus in favour of them, and says the scholarship programme is already making a difference. "Almost 3,000 students have studied abroad, the majority in the UK. Half of these are or will be back by the end of this year. They will provide leadership and bring a breath of fresh air. They will link their institutions to the outside world and break Kurdistan's academic isolation." Although Kurdistan has its own particular circumstances, Prof Ala'Aldeen says that the problems facing the university system are not unique - and that the model for modernisation could be applied elsewhere in the Middle East. "The problems are generic and the solutions can be implemented anywhere in the world." Commentators on Kurdistan's politics agree. Prof O'Leary says: "The Kurdistan region, Iraq and several other states in the Middle East are going through dramatic changes, and in some cases, deeply regrettable authoritarian restorations. "Most institutions are highly politicised in these societies. If the Kurdistan region can successfully reform its education system, including higher education, it can provide a model for the wider Middle East." </body>

      <title>Harvard plans to boldly go with 'Spocs'</title>
      <description>Harvard develops the next big thing for online learning. Is this the real deal?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24166247</url>

      <body>Keep up, keep up. If you've only just caught on to the concept of online university courses called Moocs, then you're in danger of falling behind again. Harvard, one of the world's most influential universities, is moving on to Spocs - which stands for small private online courses. Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go". And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc". Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up. Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection. But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered. Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts. The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted. It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses. At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds? Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands. It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits. Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model. Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students. Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials. Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information". These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work. Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus. It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences. Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX. He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility". And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution". "The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era." "What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue. It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications? The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says. "It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area." There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning. A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs. The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue". The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time. Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus. "What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?" If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"? Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective. Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests. "The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better." "Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem." </body>

      <title>UK enters online university race</title>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses. Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers. The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses. It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts. Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar". He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas. The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet. The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project. The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students. There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year. In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications. But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them. It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options. When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations. FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution. They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students. Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront". But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs. Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming. "Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor. "Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities. "Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study." Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course. FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting. He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture". This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content. This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University. "Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean. There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England. Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford. Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities. These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates. It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online. These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams. Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard. On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses. But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses. Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT. He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online. Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance. "The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow. "The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system." Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets." </body>

      <title>Gordon Brown's Syrian refugee school plan</title>
      <description>Syria's refugee crisis is also threatening to become a long-term education disaster.</description>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks. "A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon. As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school. Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks. It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school. But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (£319m). The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy. This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds. Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived. The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes. Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population. But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling. The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war. Forty years ago Médecins Sans Frontières established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones. Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief. Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations. Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence. On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees. In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds. It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world." </body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23931078</url>

      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education? In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show. This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead. Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course. Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show. A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics". Showbiz lessons The show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience". She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show". The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids. It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive. This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week. Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education. And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning. Dumbing down? This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection. There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time. But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus? "When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university. "The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show." Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples. "In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course." Apocalypse studies Josh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show. "This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental." "This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters." Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning? "Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says. He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet. "The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says. Personal learning For the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online. "The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble. "The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that." These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students. Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities. But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected. William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs. And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate. They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says. Spoiler alert Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses. Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary. "The student must be able to sift the evidence. "For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says. Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment. But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected. With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert. </body>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied. The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies. There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea. The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place. This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies. One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard. This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone. This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (£20bn' 23.5bn euro). But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings. Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique. It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo. Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe. In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place. But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities. Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin. Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart. </body>

      <title>The scientists who escaped the Nazis</title>
      <description>A first-hand memory of the scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany</description>

      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority. The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel. They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history. Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research. The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers. Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule. He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics. Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis? "Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months." Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him. There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav. The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more". It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating. "They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way." When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders. "My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey." While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain. The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics. It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain. It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman. Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933. He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil. "It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people." He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living". The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs. This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy. According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939. Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard. There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him. Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort. In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won. Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen. There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake. In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen. Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls. But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue. Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism. What lessons should be learned from all this? Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year. It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions". There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said. The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world. But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve. His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society. His father, remembered for his science research, played Bach on the piano every day. These were internationalists, their ideas and research moving across national and political boundaries. Such a world proved fragile in the face of the Nazis. And Gustav Born says people can too often overlook that Germany had still been a young country in the 1930s, little more than 60 years old, and that it hadn't built the institutions able to resist its own "militaristic and nationalistic" tendencies. He is very much aware that he is now one of the few remaining people who can talk first-hand about such a legacy. "I'm sad that it almost ends with me. "I want them not to forget that things like this, the suppression of a country by a gang of murderous crooks and the victimisation of people of good nature and good intention, it could happen again." </body>

      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says. Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school. The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education. But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success. In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling. After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely. "By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco. But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million. "If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%." Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom. Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate. So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova. It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places. Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding. In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers. But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance. Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments. "Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism. "The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society." The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says. Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general. "Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis. "But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking. "We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education." Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls. Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls. Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem. "One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says. "It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn." And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal. "It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy. "There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect. "This is the best thing that could happen to humanity." The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute. A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school. It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong. A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict. In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls. In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed. The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students. Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed. Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward. This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results". But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school. It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow. "In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument." </body>

      <body>Detention sheets describing Beatle John Lennon's schoolboy misdemeanours are being put up for sale. Teachers from Liverpool's Quarry Bank High School for Boys wrote that 15-year-old Lennon was punished for "fighting in class" and "sabotage". The two documents from 1955 were rescued by a teacher in the 1970s who had been told to burn all of the books in a storage room at the school. The sheets are expected to be sold for up to £3,000 each at auction. The documents reveal that on two occasions Lennon received three detentions in one day. Other reasons given by his teachers for punishment include "nuisance", "shoving" and "just no interest whatsoever". The sheets cover the periods when he was in Class 3B between 19 May and 23 June 1955, and in Class 4C from 25 November 1955 to 13 February 1956. Lennon went on to meet Paul McCartney in 1957 and together they formed the Beatles, who had their first hit in late 1962 with the song Love Me Do. That kick-started a career which brought fame and fortune and songs that have influenced generations of musicians since. The details of the young Lennon's detentions were discovered by an enterprising teacher in the late 1970s. He had been asked to clear out a storage room to make space for a newly-appointed teacher and had been instructed to burn all the books stored in the room. But spotting the name "Lennon" in the top of some of the pages he realised they related to the famous former student and tore the sheets from the book to retain as a keepsake. A number of the pages he had taken out of the book and kept were destroyed at a later date in an accident involving chemicals. Other sheets he gave away but these pages are some of the few that have survived. The sheets have been authenticated by Lennon's close school friend, Pete Shotton, who wrote a book John Lennon: In My Life. Peter Beech, who was Lennon's general science teacher at the time, said: "The sheet is typical of John Lennon, he was an extremely cheeky boy. "He did, however, know his limits. In the classroom, if you settled John down, you generally settled the class down. "His chemistry teacher Eric Oldman said that John could actually go far." Lennon was shot dead aged 40 outside his New York apartment on 8 December 1980 by Mark Chapman. Online bidding for the detention sheets and other items of Beatles memorabilia starts at tracksauction.com on 22 November. </body>

      <body>School pupils and young musicians in Dumfries and Galloway are to play a key role in recording a new version of The Beatles' iconic Sgt Pepper album. Music producer Tom Newman is re-imagining classic albums using children and traditional instruments. Working with children in Ireland, he has already re-versioned Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells album which he also produced the first time around. Now he will create a fresh Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in Scotland. "I am a great busker and the idea is going into a school classroom with just a thread of an idea and throwing it out there and letting the kids respond to it," Mr Newman explained. "It gathers its own momentum - it gathers its own energy very, very quickly." He said they would use "any instrument that seemed appropriate". "The plan is to just let the schools do it themselves - let them choose which song from Sgt Pepper they want to play with and see what they come up with," he added. "I am really busting to get in the classrooms and see how to do it - it is magic, really." Mr Newman has been getting help from Moniaive-based DJ and musician Hugh Taylor to find the young people to take part. From meetings that have taken place so far, it is likely that most will come from schools and youth groups in Dumfries and Galloway. "Any kids doing music at any level are going to have a chance to be involved in this," said Mr Taylor. "They are going to be able to work with a legend of the music industry." He added that it was a chance to recreate what he considered to be the "most groundbreaking and changing album ever recorded". </body>

      <body>People who speak more than one language and who develop dementia tend to do so up to five years later than those who are monolingual, according to a study. Scientists examined almost 650 dementia patients and assessed when each one had been diagnosed with the condition. They found people who spoke two or more languages experienced a later onset of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia. The bilingual advantage extended to illiterate people. The scientists said it confirmed the observed effect was not caused by differences in formal education. The study was by Edinburgh University and Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences in Hyderabad in India. It is the largest study so far to gauge the impact of bilingualism on the onset of dementia, independent of a person's education, gender, occupation and whether they live in a city or in the country, all of which have been examined as potential factors influencing the onset of dementia. The team of researchers said further studies were needed to determine the mechanism, which causes the delay in the onset of dementia. The researchers suggested bilingual switching between different sounds, words, concepts, grammatical structures and social norms constituted a form of natural brain training, which was likely to be more effective than any artificial brain training programme. However, studies of bilingualism are complicated in that bilingual populations are often ethnically and culturally different from monolingual societies. In places like Hyderabad, bilingualism is part of everyday life, knowledge of several languages is the norm and monolingualism is an exception. Thomas Bak, of Edinburgh University's school of philosophy, psychology and language sciences said: "These findings suggest that bilingualism might have a stronger influence on dementia than any currently available drugs. "This makes the study of the relationship between bilingualism and cognition one of our highest priorities." The study is published in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. </body>

      <title>Two-year-olds 'should start school'</title>
      <description>Two-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds should be enrolled in school nurseries to improve their chances, the chairwoman of Ofsted has suggested.</description>

      <body>Two-year-olds from disadvantaged families should be enrolled in school nurseries to improve their chances, the chairwoman of Ofsted has suggested. Many children from poor backgrounds have a "dire" start to their education, according to Baroness Sally Morgan. They can be up to a year and a half behind their better-off classmates by the age of five, she said. The Pre-School Learning Alliance described Lady Morgan's suggestion as "beyond belief". "Who would disagree with Sally Morgan that children from disadvantaged backgrounds need considerably more support. However, to suggest that placing two and three-year-olds in schools is the answer is beyond belief. "Social inequality needs to addressed in many ways and taking very young children away from their parents and placing them in formal schooling is not the answer," said Alliance chief executive Neil Leitch. Mr Leitch added that international research put the UK's specialist early years network of childminders and nurseries among the world's best. "I am struggling to understand why anyone would promote pushing our youngest, most vulnerable children into schools rather than using the existing network of specialist local provision offered by childminders and group settings," he said. The government said it was making it easier for schools to take children from the age of two. Speaking at an event organised by an academy chain, Lady Morgan argued that poor parenting, poor diet and poor housing meant disadvantaged children were often not ready to start formal schooling at five. She called for a "big brave move" in early years education, with more nurseries attached to schools and a particular focus on the poorest children. She said more schools should become "all through", taking pupils from age three or younger to age 18. Her comments echo a recent Ofsted report which suggested that poor five-year-olds are 19 months behind their more affluent peers. "What a dire start to their educational life," said Lady Morgan. "Those children had low level social skills especially reading and communication. "They're not ready to learn at school. Weak parenting, low educational attainment of parents, poor diet, poor housing and so on. "The gap between affluent and disadvantaged is greatest in that group. "No-one has yet got a grip on this problem", she said. "I think there needs to be a big brave move on the under-fives agenda to target funding heavily on the children who will benefit most and increasingly, I think, to look to strong providers to go further down the system. We've increasingly got five-to-18 schools, why not three-to-18?" A Department for Education spokeswoman responded: "We know that teacher-led early years education has a positive impact on children, especially on those from low income backgrounds. "That is why we are making it easier for schools to take children from the age of two by removing the requirement on them to register separately with Ofsted when doing so, and introducing 15 hours of free early education for 240,000 of the poorest two-year-olds." The spokeswoman said government reforms would ensure all children, regardless of background, get a good start in life with all three- and four-year-olds entitled to 15 hours a week of free early education. Educational Psychologist Dr Jo van Herwegen of Kingston University said formal learning risked damaging children's development if started too early. "It's really all about what you define as being 'school' education and the government needs to understand that children learn through play at this young age. "Formal learning is extremely difficult as children's working memory and language abilities are still developing, "Forcing children to learn in formal settings and sit tests regularly can risk creating performance anxiety and an aversion to learning later on in life". Wendy Ellyat of the Save Childhood Movement said the key was to "prioritise child-flourishing and well-being over educational attainment", whether children were with childminders or in schools or nurseries. "We also need to look at how best to support parents as the most important thing for such young children is to have stable, loving and supportive home lives." </body>

      <description>A leading university is offering up to 500 paid internships to undergraduates.</description>

      <body>A leading university is offering up to 500 paid internships to undergraduates. The University of Leicester says they will be available to students based in the UK or EU starting degree courses in 2014 and will last up to 12 weeks each. The aim is to give students insight into what employers want from recruits and to compete in a global jobs market. "Crucially we want our students to be able to adapt to the challenges they face when they leave", said career development manager Raj Patel. The university says the scheme will be the first of its kind offered by any top-20 higher education institution in the UK. All the internships will pay the equivalent of £12,000 to £16,000 a year pro rata, says the university. Some will be within the university's own departments, others will be in the private sector. Bob Athwal, director of career development, said a growing number of employers were using student internships "to feed their talent pipeline". The new scheme will involve an application and selection process, with a programme of workshops to help students prepare. The university has promised the interview process will provide "every campus-based home or EU student with an opportunity during their degree". Mr Athwal says this idea is to showcase "a rich pool of talent" among Leicester undergraduates. The graduate jobs market has been tight in recent years. Figures produced by the Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR) in July this year forecast a 4% fall in graduate vacancies, with leading UK employers reporting an average of 85 applications for each job. A separate survey of more than 18,000 university leavers, published in June, suggested graduates who had had internships were three times more likely to get jobs. The study by High Fliers research found that more than one in three students had completed work experience or internships with a prospective employer. </body>

      <title>Forced academies 'costing too much'</title>
      <description>An internal document leaked to the BBC suggests ministers are prepared to force schools to become academies even when the costs are disproportionate to the benefits.</description>

      <body>Ministers are making struggling schools become academies even when the costs are disproportionate to the benefits, a leaked government document suggests. Civil servants planning for budget cuts at the education department suggested ministers consider value for money before forcing academy conversions. But Education Secretary Michael Gove overruled this cash-saving idea as "totally wrong", the document reveals. The education department says academies are the best way of improving schools. But the National Union of Teachers said Mr Gove's "pet policies are driving the education agenda at any cost". Academies are privately run schools funded by the state in England. They have control over their own admissions, and increased freedoms over what they teach and pay staff. They can get up to £110,000 in start-up costs. Where underperforming schools are unwilling to convert to academy status, it is enforced in several steps - including sacking the governors and replacing them with a hand-picked interim governing body. Ultimately the secretary of state can issue an academy order requiring a change in the school's management. The Department for Education (DfE) sees the academies programme as its key engine of school improvement, but critics have described the process as heavy-handed and undemocratic. The DfE plans to cut its administrative budget by £290m by 2015-16. The document, entitled What Stops at the DfE, looks at where savings could be made. It says forced conversions are "very resource intensive" and reveals that the government's underperformance strategy is in need of extra funds. But despite tight department budgets, it is clear that conversions where the costs outweigh the benefits - often where there is strong opposition to a change - are still being pushed through. The document suggests more account should be taken of a "cost-benefit analysis" in "determining the approach to academisation of underperforming schools". But it stresses that the secretary of state does not want to see such value-for-money checks on the programme and that the changes have not been made. It adds that ministers had expected to see some schools or heads change their mind about becoming academies as a result of high profile cases such as that of Downhills Primary School, which it cites as an example. Mr Gove ordered the Haringey school be taken over by an academy chain, despite 94% of parents opposing the move, and claims that it was already on a trajectory of improvement when the conversion was being proposed. Legal action was threatened as a result and teachers walked out on strike. But the document says: "Achieving success in difficult areas has a bigger potential pay-off and is important for the reputation and reach of the overall programme but both this and forced conversions are very resource intensive." And it warns: "If we limit the number of forced interventions there is a risk that we don't tackle the worst performing schools (which would not otherwise become academies)." It is also clear that the DfE is seeking extra cash to ensure the forced academies programme is maintained. It talks about "securing the additional resource needed for the underperformance strategy" and says it will not place "any arbitrary limits on forced conversion activity". And indeed the document is peppered with references to how money can be transferred from the oversight of maintained schools so that the "increasing stock of academies and free schools can be managed". At the same time work on a new admissions code, which the document says might prove inevitable because of various pressures, has been axed. And oversight of boarding schools and home education is being downgraded despite civil servant warnings that there could be child protection risks as a result. A DfE spokesman said: "Ministers are clear we will not stand by when a school is failing its pupils, and that the strong support of a proven sponsor is the best way to see rapid and sustainable improvements. "While it is vital that government constantly considers ways to cut bureaucracy and save public money, we make no apology for prioritising improving the education of children in the country's worst performing schools." National Union of Teachers general secretary Christine Blower said: "Despite civil servants identifying the forced academy programme as an activity that could be cut back in order to address the disproportionate cost to the public purse, this document makes clear that ideology won out over sound public policy decision making. "It is increasingly evident that Michael Gove's pet policies are driving the education agenda at any cost. "At a time when school budgets elsewhere are being cut is really quite an inappropriate use of public finances." David Simmonds, of the Local Government Association, said: "In many cases, giving more flexibility to local areas to take swift action, for instance by recruiting new governors and staff, would be a better and more cost effective way of improving standards. "Councils want to be able to intervene more quickly and effectively in poorly performing schools but are hampered by excessive bureaucracy. "Money spent on conversion costs could be saved by enabling earlier intervention by councils who are focused on school performance rather than management structures." </body>

      <description>Learning a musical instrument as a child confers brain gains that last long into adult life, according to a small study.</description>

      <body>Learning a musical instrument as a child gives the brain a boost that lasts long into adult life, say scientists. Adults who used to play an instrument, even if they have not done so in decades, have a faster brain response to speech sounds, research suggests. The more years of practice during childhood, the faster the brain response was, the small study found. The Journal of Neuroscience work looked at 44 people in their 50s, 60s and 70s. The volunteers in the study listened to a synthesised speech syllable, "da", while researchers measured electrical activity in the region of the brain that processes sound information - the auditory brainstem. Despite none of the study participants having played an instrument in nearly 40 years, those who completed between four and 14 years of music training early in life had a faster response to the speech sound than those who had never been taught music. The study took place at the Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory at Northwestern University in Illinois, US. As people grow older, they often experience changes in the brain that compromise hearing. For instance, the brains of older adults show a slower response to fast-changing sounds, which is important for interpreting speech. It could be that learning an instrument in childhood causes a fixed change in the brain that is retained throughout life. Or, music classes somehow prepare the brain for future auditory learning, say the researchers. Past work by the same team found younger adults were better listeners if they had been taught an instrument as a child. Experts also believe musical training - with an emphasis on rhythmic skills - can exercise the auditory-system. But these studies are all relatively small and cannot ascertain if it is definitely musical training that is causing the effect. Arguably, children offered the opportunity to learn an instrument, which can be expensive, may come from more privileged backgrounds and this may have an influence. Commenting on the study, Michael Kilgard from the University of Texas, who was not involved with the research, said: "Being a millisecond faster may not seem like much, but the brain is very sensitive to timing and a millisecond compounded over millions of neurons can make a real difference in the lives of older adults." </body>

      <body>Three single mothers and their children have lost a legal challenge to the government's benefit cap. Judges ruled that regulations brought in by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith were lawful and did not breach human rights. The £500-a-week cap affects housing benefit, child benefit and child tax credit for families not working enough hours to get working tax credit. The government said it was "very pleased" at the High Court's ruling. The cap, introduced in July in England, Scotland and Wales, is set at the same level for couples or single parents. Lawyers acting for three mothers and one child from each family, all from the London area, said the "cruel and arbitrary" measure was "reminiscent of the days of the workhouse", and the women feared it would leave them destitute. They argued the cap unlawfully breached the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for home and family life. The legal challenge was supported by the Child Poverty Action Group and the Women's Aid Federation. Dismissing their claim for judicial review, Lord Justice Elias and Mr Justice Bean said that no doubt many considered the cap to be "too parsimonious". They ruled: "But that is ultimately a policy issue, and for the reasons we have given we do not think it can be said that the scheme is so manifestly unfair or disproportionate as to justify an interference by the courts." A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: "We are very pleased that the court has ruled that the benefit cap complies with the European Convention on Human Rights. "The benefit cap sets a fair limit to what people can expect to get from the welfare system - so that claimants cannot receive more than £500 a week, the average household earnings." </body>

      <body>The former prime minister John Major told a meeting at the South Norfolk Conservative Association that the dominance of a private school elite in the upper echelons of British life is truly shocking, according to the Telegraph. The paper has quoted him as saying: "Our education system should help children out of the circumstances in which they are born, not lock them in." Speaking to the Today programme, Harry Mount, author and blogger for the Telegraph, who attended private school and went to Oxford University himself, believes it is "staggeringly unfair'" that the higher echelons are dominated by privately-educated individuals. "I think the obvious thing to return and bring back grammar schools," he added. Owen Jones, author and columnist for the Independent, who attended a state school and also went to Oxford University, said: "Comprehensive education often gets scapegoated for the wider social inequalities in society - which are driving the fact that better-off students do better in school, than those from poorer backgrounds."

      <body>Colorado will become the first state in America to tax the sale of marijuana. Under new legalisation cannabis sales will have a 25% levy placed on them to pay for public school construction and the marijuana industry costs. Brian Vicente, Chair of the Marijuana Tax Campaign told BBC Radio 5 live's Up All Night: "It has taken the money out of the hands of drug cartels, moved it behind the counter... and then the tax revenue actually benefits the state." </body>

      <body>It's not the $1m question. It's the million Swiss francs question. It has become a depressingly universal truth in education that children from poorer backgrounds tend on average to do less well than their richer counterparts. But what would happen if you took those poorer families and gave them money, real hard cash? If you make a poor family richer, will their children's chances of success rise accordingly? Or is it too complicated for such a direct approach? Are children being held back not by lack of money, but by poverty's fellow travellers, such as bad housing, ill health, unemployment, chaotic parenting or family breakdown? Or are poor children getting stuck in a downward spiral of poorly educated parents and bad schools? A US economist, Prof Greg Duncan, has won a million Swiss franc (£680,000) research prize to find out, in an annual award by the Zurich-based Jacobs Foundation, a charity that supports research into improving childhood. Prof Duncan, an expert on the impact of poverty in childhood, wants to take a randomised group of a thousand low-income single mothers with a newborn child and give them $4,000 (£2,890) each for the first three years of the children's lives. Another control group of mothers will get a much smaller amount. Prof Duncan, from the School of Education at the University of California, Irvine, is going to to measure what happens next. The experiment will be a big, expensive, long-term venture, with the prize money supporting the pilot stage. But Prof Duncan wants this to answer some big questions about what happens if you reduce hardship in the earliest years. Can raising income deliver a measurable change in family life and children's progress? Will neuroscientists find a difference in cognitive development between those who receive the $4,000 and those who don't? "We want to see whether we can find a direct link between poverty reduction and brain development in very young children," Prof Duncan says. The idea of giving financial support to low-income families is well established - it underpins a range of family benefits, allowances and tax credits in many countries. But what this study wants to discover is the specific impact of changing income in the years before school. Prof Duncan's earlier research has suggested strong links between experiences in the early years and how adults fare in later life. This is the time when children are developing most rapidly, when the "architecture of the brain" is being established, he says. There won't be any constraints on how these low-income families spend the extra money. If families throw away the cash recklessly, rather than spending it on supporting children, that will be part of the findings. The purity of the experiment is to see what happens in the real world if poor young parents are made slightly less poor. Will their children's school performance be less poor as well? Prof Duncan's research has highlighted how the achievement gap is already entrenched by the age of five, suggesting that intervention needs to come earlier. Before pupils turn up for their first day at school, middle-class children are already ahead of their poorer classmates at such tasks as recognising letters or putting numbers in order. And children who are poor at the age of five are on a downward track that makes them more likely to leave education earlier, earn less money and suffer poor health than richer children. There are also striking differences in family structure. A poor girl is more than five times more likely to grow up and have children outside of marriage than her wealthier classmates. The experiment, which is planned to launch in 2015, will try to establish to what extent living on a low income is the "active ingredient" in such different outcomes. If parents are under less financial pressure, will they behave differently to their children? Will family time change with more spending power? The study will try to separate the low-income effect from other factors such as family relationships, individual character and personal resilience. This experiment has a particular resonance for the US education system. In the past, even though the poor in the US might have lacked some social security "safety nets", Prof Duncan says there was a very valuable compensation from public investment in the education system. It provided a ladder upwards. But that is no longer the case, he says. The US education system had been a world leader, a superpower in education as well as in economic and military terms. But more recently it has faced a stream of bad news. Last month, there was a new low ebb when the influential the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development think tank published research showing that young people in the US workforce had the lowest levels of maths skills in the developed world. Such weaknesses in education have a great significance for the life chances of children born into poverty. A major study this month from the independent Pew Research group, based in Philadelphia, looked at the factors that helped people born into low-income families in the US to rise up the income ladder. Such "rags to riches" stories are more common in Hollywood movies than in real life, the study concludes. But where people do beat the odds and rise up the ladder, the key factor is education. Getting a college degree is the surest route to social mobility, the research shows. College graduates were over five times more likely to escape the bottom rung of the ladder. Family structure was also a big influence. Two-parent families were more than three times as likely to move out of the lowest-income bracket compared with single-parent families. The study shows that education and family are the dominant influences on escaping poverty. What Prof Duncan's research will investigate is whether inserting cash into the equation can improve the odds of success. </body>

      <title>Is there an 'angst canon' of books that teenagers read?</title>
      <description>Do teenagers still read the same rite of passage books?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24833198</url>

      <body>It's 100 years since the birth of Albert Camus. His book The Outsider is one of a select set of works that generations of disaffected teenagers have turned to as a rite of passage. The 1942 novel, also known as The Stranger, is about a French Algerian's seemingly irrational murder of an Arab and his subsequent indifference to his own execution. Central character Meursault is a man alienated from the society in which he lives. There's The Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger. Central character Holden is alienated from the society in which he lives. George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four is a critique of totalitarian societies, but it's also about Winston Smith and his alienation from the society in which he lives. Aldous Huxley's Brave New World provides a dystopian vision of the world - through the eyes of a man alienated from the society in which he lives. Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar has a female protagonist whose mental illness is partly because of her alienation from a society which has fixed expectations of women. Then there's Joseph Heller's Catch-22 where central character Yossarian is rather alienated. And Franz Kafka's The Trial where… You get the picture. These books have formed a kind of canon of disaffected literature for disaffected teenagers. At the age of 17 and 18, readers are often searching for something with a bit of existential angst. And nothing taps into teenage angst quite like the idea of exceptionalism. The books in "the canon" can provide a feeling of uniqueness - a clandestine understanding of the world that nobody else quite gets. "'I can see through this, and Kafka can, but you can't'," says Guardian literary critic Nicholas Lezard of the feeling. "'Me and Kafka, we're buddies.'" A book like Catch-22 provides a prism for teenage readers, says Prof John Sutherland, an English literature professor at University College London. "It had sort of this ironic view of the adult world, where you're always trapped. [These books are] intellectual breakthrough stuff, a way of breaking out, a rite of passage." As well as looking for echoes of their disaffection, teenagers are also often attempting to look, well, a bit cool. The books are like a badge of honour. An actual badge, in Lezard's case. "I found a badge for sale that just had the word 'Outsider' on it," he says. "I wore that on my school blazer for a bit." The book itself might be placed conspicuously on show, with the titles poking out of school blazer pockets and tops of satchels. "[They're] what you might call 'accessory books'," says Sutherland. "The book was, as it were, to make a statement. It was particularly pronounced in 1960s, 70s and 80s adolescence. People used to sit around in coffee shops holding a copy of whatever the latest Samuel Beckett was and probably couldn't answer how many Ts there are in Beckett." Any teenager seen reading the book on public transport is sending out a message. "You know that if you sit on the Tube reading that [type of book], people will know you're an angst-ridden teenager," says historian Lisa Jardine, who has researched the reading preferences of men and women. Some may even detect a note of pretentiousness although most teenagers stop short of sporting a beret and pipe and disdainfully peering over a French-language copy of L'Etranger [The Outsider]. But calling the majority of teenagers pretentious is too harsh, says Jardine. "I don't like that word. I would call it 'statement reading'," she says. "They're exploring them, and they're struggling with them, and therefore it's more about statement than showing off. You swap [the fact] that you've read these books and then you know you've got a kindred spirit." Even if there is some posturing, it's not unhealthy, says Lezard, as it's partly about raising your game into adulthood - and some of the ideas do filter in. "So I don't regret any of this," he says. "Perhaps the badge." But the canon of teenage angst books is not the same for both sexes. "There's an absolutely dramatic difference between what girls and boys read at puberty," says Jardine. "Boys read angst books, so they read Catcher in the Rye, L'Etranger and books like that. Girls read expanding emotion and sensibility books. Jane Eyre, [Dodie Smith's] I Capture the Castle, the Brontes… books about difficult relationships. "It was absolutely staggering how little teenage angst books came up on the women's list." Men also tend to cling on to their teenage favourites later into life more than women, Jardine's research showed. But does the canon stay the same? And is there always a group of angsty teenagers to read it? "Nineteen Eighty-Four makes you re-evaluate society," says 17-year-old Enosh Ghimire, from Ealing, west London. "It's a common theme in many of the books - criticising society or evaluating what society is." The canon itself isn't stable. New books may be added, others fall by the wayside. A good movie adaptation can be an obstacle. Trainspotting, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest - those reaching adolescence after these films came out had to be extra committed to read the books after watching them - or disciplined enough to read them first. Ghimire says he and many of his friends enjoy reading Game of Thrones and that many are reading the Hunger Games, both of which have popular TV or movie franchises to accompany them. Laura Hampson, 18, from Liverpool, says her friends don't read that much but "they've read The Perks of Being a Wallfower recently because of the film". Hampson is a fan of contemporary John Green titles Looking for Alaska and An Abundance of Katherines. But she says her favourite book is David Nicholls's popular book One Day, pointing to its unusual time structure and relatable characters. "It didn't make out either character was without fault," she adds. "With some romance books the other character can sometimes be described as this perfect person, which most people can't relate to." Another obstacle to the cultish or cool feel of books in the canon is the way many of them have been absorbed into English literature syllabuses on both sides of the Atlantic over the past 30 years. Ghimire studies both Brave New World and Nineteen Eighty-Four as part of his course, admitting that they're not books he'd normally read. "School opens [them] up," he says. "I wouldn't have known about Brave New World if it wasn't for school. School made me aware that there are other books outside of what I would normally read." But news and current affairs makes some of the books resonate further, he says, citing the Edward Snowden spying affair as making Nineteen Eighty-Four really click. "And Brave New World is going to be relevant for a long time because of technological advances," Ghimire says. And it's only with a sense of irony, or perhaps disappointment, that teenagers realise their mum's favourite book was also Nineteen Eighty-Four and their dad's was Catch-22. "The feeling of being awkward and unhappy at school is in fact perennial," says Sutherland. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>German home school families refugees in US</title>
      <description>Will the US deport German home-school families?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24804804</url>

      <body>Uwe and Hanalore Romeike want to educate their seven children at home, rather than in the school system. But in Germany where they come from originally, home schooling is illegal. It isn't just discouraged, it is punishable by heavy fines and imprisonment and their children could be taken away from them. So along with other German home-schooling families they have come to the United States and are seeking asylum. But the claim they are being persecuted has not been accepted and unless the Supreme Court intervenes they face deportation from the US. "We are being persecuted, as are many other home schooling families in Germany," says Mr Romeike. "Parents should have the right to choose the best education for their children. That's what's lacking in Germany. We don't have freedom of education." The family arrived in the US in 2008 and settled in Tennessee. In 2010 a state court granted their request for asylum but two years later the Obama administration called for a review and a higher court overturned the decision. The Romeikes' only hope of staying in the US now rests with the Supreme Court which still hasn't decided whether to hear their appeal. "We started home schooling because our two oldest children were in public school for a few years and from the beginning had problems. "Our daughter started having headaches and stomach aches, our son's personality changed. After we started home schooling all these symptoms disappeared. We didn't want to stop," says Mr Romeike. "Home schooling is not about motivation or methodology. Home schooling is simply about parents making the choice as to what's best for their children," says Michael Donnelly, a lawyer for the Home School Legal Defense Association. The HDLA is assisting the Romeikes and other German parents including Dirk and Petra Wunderlich. German police recently placed their four children in temporary care because the Wunderlichs refused to send them to school. "There was no other question about this family - they weren't abusing or neglecting their children - the only issue was that they were not in school," says Mr Donnelly. "It's really quite striking when you look at a free country - as Germany claims to be - and you see how they treat parents who want to exercise a freedom." The children have been returned to the Wunderlichs, but the German government has banned them from leaving the country, says Mr Donnelly. Like many families who decide to educate their children at home, the Romeikes and the Wunderlichs are evangelical Christians. But some law experts say they their grounds for claiming religious persecution in Germany are weak. "Germany is a democratic country and it chooses to make attendance in schools mandatory. It offers many choices of school - Christian, Jewish, Muslim, private, public - every imaginable sort," says Professor David Abraham an expert on immigration and citizenship law at the University of Miami School of Law. "But its legislature has decided that children need the social context of meeting other children. "Parents have a responsibility to raise their children properly, but that does not mean they have a right to counter democratic legislation. What they can't call persecution is the obligation to attend school with other children. That's an important social value that the German legislature has adopted," he says. Many children educated at home in the US also attend home school co-ops where parents pool their skills to enable specialised or more advanced subjects to be taught. They also meet other families who share similar values. "It's a very nice environment. Everything is very Christian and I really enjoy that. I also enjoy being able to pray with my mom whenever I need to," says 13-year-old Esther Reinhold who lives in Sterling, Virginia. Her parents, Ulrike and Matthias Reinhold, emigrated from Germany and became US citizens in order to home school their six children. "We enjoy home schooling because it is very family oriented, it strengthens our family," says Mr Reinhold. "We spend time teaching them the regular subjects but they also have time to pursue their interests in a stronger way than they would in a normal school setting." "I'm definitely glad we are allowed to home school here," says 15-year-old Ruth Reinhold who also attends a co-op and has private piano lessons. "I could go to a public Christian school but even there, there's still a lot more drama about the dating thing and there's a lot more foul language. I know that if I went to public school within about four weeks I would be going along with the others, cursing and dishonouring God especially." More than two million children are taught at home in the US and the number is growing. Professor Brian Ray, president of the National Home Education Research Institute, says that a strand in the home schooling movement developed in the 1970s when some Christians began questioning the type of education their children were receiving in state and privately run schools. But he says it's too simplistic to describe home schooling as a religious movement. "I've met many non-Christian parents who would say the same thing: it's not the government's job to indoctrinate my children," he says. "The core issue is who is in charge of a child's education. Whether home schoolers are agnostic, Jews, or Christians they all believe in parental responsibility for the child's education and they don't think the state should be doing it." </body>

      <title>Housing association helps tenants to read</title>
      <description>The housing association that also teaches literacy</description>

      <body>A few months ago, Christopher had to ask a neighbour or a friend to read him details of a personal hospital appointment or a letter about his rent. Now he can do it himself. In and out of care homes all his life, Christopher left school at 13, without being able to read and write properly. But his life changed when he saw an advert in the local community centre about the Eastlands Homes Literacy Beacons Project in Manchester. After six weeks of one-to-one tuition with a mentor, he was beginning to make sense of the words around him. "I can pick up my mail and look at it, I can pick up books. Before I'd get a brown letter and I'd have to ask a friend or a partner to help," he says. "It's like being proper independent. I don't have to knock on someone else's door. It's given me more independence and I'm proud of it like, I really am." The Literacy Beacon Project was set up 18 months ago by the not-for-profit housing association Eastlands Homes for its tenants and others in the area. Eastlands has 8,000 properties across east and south-east Manchester and many of these are in some of the most deprived wards in the country. So far more than 40 people have completed the course. The idea is simple - adults who struggle to read and write are matched with a volunteer "champion" or mentor who, after some training, meets with them regularly on a one-to-one basis over a six-week period. The scheme started when front-line staff realised many tenants were struggling to read correspondence from them, using excuses like they had not received the letter or had lost their glasses. Neighbourhood services manager Danny O'Sullivan says: "We knew a lot of our tenants had literacy problems. "From a business point of view, it does us a good turn because they can read our letters and so on, but the drive behind the scheme was to help people in the community. "We want to improve people's lives, we are a community project as well as a housing association." Danny says a lot of people who believe they cannot read or write actually do have some basic literacy skills, but have such low confidence they have convinced themselves they are illiterate. He says: "If something frustrates us, we tend not to do it. Take technology - you'd rather ask the kids. You can do it, but the frustration stops you. "The issue is the negative stereotype in your head, 'I can't read, I don't need to read, I'm not going to read.'" Amanda approached the Literacy Beacons Project because she was struggling to fill out contact sheets in her role as a volunteer mentor for offenders recently released from prison. "I was always behind with the sheets, but I couldn't get anyone else to do it because it's confidential information. Now I've got the confidence to pick up a pen. "I think it's because of the one-to-one support, they made me feel dead confident. I had no confidence to pick up a pen. "But here it's the best thing because it's a one-to-one. If I'm in a classroom I get all nervous and worried I'm going to be called thick, because that's what I've had in my life. It's all about my confidence, my champion gives me loads of encouragement. "It's amazing, I've got someone saying I'm good and that makes me feel better about myself. It's made me feel really confident in my reading and writing. "I can go for a job now, I've got the confidence to go for that job and go to the interview." But it's not just the tenants who have benefited from the scheme. Eastlands has found that those who volunteer as champions have reaped huge rewards. Paul, a champion who has helped four people develop their reading, says: "I retired a few years ago and I get so much reward out of this - I never got the buzz that I get out of this. It's time-consuming but it's lovely to do. "As much as they're learning, we're learning from them because we're understanding their issues. All my working life I've never enjoyed anything like this." Sam, who has mentored five tenants, adds: "It's so rewarding to see what you've achieved for somebody. "It's better as well because we're not teachers and we don't spell everything right. They feel at ease with one person and they don't have to feel that someone's ahead of them." Sam was particularly touched by the case of one elderly lady who had been constrained by literacy problems all her life. "I had a 75-year-old lady and only her husband knew she had trouble with reading and writing," she says. "When he passed away, she was on her own. She was buying the same things in the supermarket because that was what she recognised. But now she can read the labels - she has the choice." Champions are not just community volunteers - staff working for the housing association are also encouraged to mentor those who sign up for the project. Eastlands communications manager Abi Mistry says: "I had a woman with three kids and she'd never been able to leave her children little notes. When she finally wrote a letter to her eight-year-old son, she cried - and I cried, it was so emotional. "She had left school with no qualifications, had her first child at 17 and couldn't help them with their homework. To see her confidence grow was amazing." The housing association is now so confident with the scheme, it hopes to take it to other areas of need, such as prisons and rehabilitation centres. Danny O'Sullivan says: "We're in talks with the National Literacy Trust. We're trying to grow it, to get it elsewhere. It's a great system and we hope it'll go out further. "I'd like to see a lot of other organisations doing it and not just housing associations. It would be brilliant in prisons, in probation offices, drug rehabilitation centres, community charities, anywhere that socially deprived people are accessing. "We understand it well enough now to take it to other places." Amanda wants to see the project benefit other people like her. She says: "I just think it should be rolled out everywhere because there are people out there, especially older people, who would be too scared to say, 'I can't read or write.'" In the meantime, the literacy project has been shortlisted in the Business in the Community category at the Manchester Be Proud Awards. </body>

      <description>Should the US learn from India's technology students</description>

      <body>By the year 2020 the US is expected to have 1.4 million computing-related jobs, but will only have the capacity to fill a third of them. Should schools in the United States be looking to Asia for tips on how to get more students to study science and maths? From a young age, children at India's top schools have it drilled into them that they must excel in maths and science. Their goal is to win a coveted place at one of the 16 Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and a fast track to a high-flying job. The IITs enjoy no international ranking but they have been recognised by the US Congress and Microsoft founder Bill Gates for their contribution to US innovation. Graduates have gone on to be leading high-tech innovators - for example the creator of Google news Krishna Bharat, and the co-founders of online poker site PartyGaming studied at the IITs. Each year about one million Indian students sit the entrance exam hoping for this kind of success, but just 10,000 people, or 1% of them make it. There are nine times more people applying for each place than there are applying to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the highest-ranking universities in the world. One student who made the grade is 21 year old Utkarsh Malhotra. He is now in his final year but says passing the entrance exam was like scaling an academic Mount Everest. "I know people who changed their diets, who changed their sleeping patterns, who changed everything for this examination," he says. "IITs are like a pressure cooker situation so I don't know if this prepares us for future life well or not." Eighteen year-old Twinkle Aurora is hoping to follow in Malhotra's footsteps. She attends a private coaching institute and spends 13 hours a day, six days a week studying to pass the exam. "It's very tough because you can't stay in touch with social media like Facebook and WhatsApp - they take a lot of your time, so you have to sacrifice lots of friendships… but after one year when you've slogged your way through the year you get something that's big," she says. But once the students are in, the pressure remains. I met Malhotra on a Friday afternoon but instead of winding down for the weekend, he was working hard. "I don't know [if any other] institutes in India have exams on a weekend but this one does. The pressure is immense and you grow to live with it," he says. So what makes the IITs so successful? "We get the best students in the country," says Suneet Tuli, the dean of research and development at the Delhi campus. "And for a country of 1.2 billion, the best is really the best." "The second thing - this is part of our culture, [education is] based a lot on mathematics, so that gives them good analytical skills." Some think the US could learn from the way India approaches science and maths, including Susan Wojcicki, senior vice president of advertising and commerce at Google. She thinks there should be much more emphasis on computer science in US schools. "Nine out of 10 schools right now are not teaching computer science. If you think about the future and you think about how important computer science is going to be it's a problem - we're going to need a lot more kids to be able to have those skills," she says. "I would really like it to be like reading and math and science and spelling - they are requirements - everybody takes it, everybody learns it, and that's the way I think we need to think about computer science and coding in the future." There has been some criticism of the methods the Indian education system uses with its reliance on rote learning, and whether this really prepares the IIT students for the wider world. Steve Stepanian, head of Indian operations for the management consultancy Bain and Company, has some reservations. "At the more junior levels they are very quantitatively sound, they are very responsible, no problem. The issue becomes [when] they're given an open-ended question - that is where there seems to be more of a struggle," he says. For example, they would get the basic figures spot on, but when he asks what advice they would give to a chief executive - "that is where you draw a real blank," he says. In his experience, the number crunching by US students may not be as accurate, but "when I come to that question of what the CEO should do, they are much more capable of synthesising that and pulling together a much more cohesive answer and make a recommendation". But for Wojcicki it is about the balance between learning the basics and thinking creatively: "I look at Silicon Valley and we have so many great engineers that have come from India," she says. "American schools are really good [when it comes to] thinking about the creative component but we also need kids to learn the basics."

      <title>The bully in the next bedroom</title>
      <description>When does sibling scrapping become bullying?</description>

      <body>Siblings routinely pick on one another, but when does bickering become bullying - and what can parents do about it? Sibling relationships can be difficult, and never more so than in childhood. But society often regards the scrapping and squabbling, the play fighting and not-so-playful fighting as a normal part of growing up. "The public brushes off aggression between siblings as just rivalry," says Corinna Tucker of the University of New Hampshire. Tucker is the lead author of a new study on the issue for the journal Pediatrics. Almost a third of the 3,600 children questioned said they had been the victim of some sort of sibling aggression in the past 12 months. The included a range of acts from theft and psychological abuse to physical assault, either mild or severe. In comparison, research suggests that up to a quarter of children are victims of schoolyard aggression every year. Corinna Tucker uses the term "sibling aggression" in her study, but psychologists are increasingly reaching for a familiar label for the bad stuff that goes on between brothers and sisters - bullying. This is defined by experts as intentional acts of aggression, repeated over a period of time, where an individual or group is in a position of power over someone. So sibling relationships would seem the perfect breeding ground for bullying, since children live together for a long period of time and there is usually an intellectual and physical power imbalance. Although there might not be an outright malevolence, there is often reason for jealousy. "A sibling relationship is emotionally intense - it's one of those relationships where you can love them and you can hate them at the same time," says Tucker. "And siblings are natural competitors for family resources and parents' attention." Laura - who grew up in a house she shared with four siblings and a foster brother - did not consider it bullying at the time, but now thinks the term captures what went on in their house in Ohio. "My older brother - I would say he beat up on all of us," she says, her voice breaking. Although he never hurt them badly, he liked to wrestle his sisters, pinning them to the floor. "He was bigger and stronger than us - he could put us in very powerless situations. It was really scary." For her brother, she believes, the activity gave him a momentary sense of control at a chaotic time for the family. Her mother, who had depression, had left home. The children were all particularly mean to the youngest sister Tracy, the focus of their mother's attention. In the afternoons, after school and before their father came home from work, they would tease Tracy until she phoned her mother to try to get them to stop. "I remember us saying to her: 'Mum can't do anything about it - she isn't coming here,'" recalls Laura. "And my dad - I think he was so overwhelmed that he only ended up dealing with the most serious things." There is a growing recognition of sibling bullying. One paper published this spring in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence highlighted ways in which it differs from playground or cyber bullying. Twenty-seven pairs of adult siblings were questioned about how they had treated each other during childhood. Most reported they had been bullied, with around a third saying it had gone on for several years. About three-quarters of the sample said they had been both bully and victim. Despite the aggression, victims and perpetrators gave high ratings for closeness, both before and after the incidents they described. Most strikingly of all, a majority viewed it as acceptable and almost all the respondents - 85% - said such behaviour should be expected. "From the young person's perspective and the parent's perspective, we do expect that siblings are going to fight with one another," says Robin Kowalski, the lead author of the study. "But there's normal discord within sibling relationships, and then there's bullying. And I can't tell you where that line is." Corinna Tucker says that some parents believe conflict between siblings can be healthy since it teaches them how to handle difficult situations. But her study, based on the large telephone survey of children, showed that children who reported recent sibling aggression were more likely to be suffering from mental distress. Research led by Dieter Wolke at the University of Warwick on large samples of British and Israeli schoolchildren has found that half the children who suffered from sibling bullying also suffered bullying at school - and that this group was particularly at risk of unhappiness or developing behavioural problems. "If you only have sibling bullying or school bullying you are about 2.7 times more likely to have behaviour problems, but if you have both then it's 14 times more likely," says Wolke. "And the point about this is that you don't have any escape. It's 24/7." Little is known about the long-term effects of sibling bullying but Jan Parker, a family psychotherapist and a co-author of Raising Happy Brothers and Sisters, is certain that they can be "serious and lifelong". "We're very familiar with discussions on the impact of [school] bullying," she says. "I don't think it takes a great imaginative leap to understand the impact of it happening within your own home. You feel that you are not only let down by the person bullying you, but also by the adults in your life that are letting it go unchecked." While sibling fights are normal, parents need to be aware of a pattern developing over time, she says. Parents are advised to talk to the children about what's happening. If they are worried, they could speak to a health professional. They should also consider what might be causing the problems. "There is one known predictor - it's when siblings perceive there to be a wide disparity between how they are treated and how their brother and sister are treated," she says. Play fighting is valuable, since it teaches them what the limits of acceptable behaviour are, says Dieter Wolke. It should be clear to parents when children go too far because they haven't learned the limits - and when they do it on purpose. Parents should be loving but firm, with clear rules, he says. Laura believes that the bullying in her house happened because her parents failed to intervene, because they were too preoccupied with their own issues. "We were so overwhelmed and there was so little adult support to find ways to resolve conflict," she says. She is now 48 and a recovering alcoholic. In adulthood, she established a good relationship with her siblings. She describes the grown-up Tracy as "very strong" and her older brother as a "gentle man". But like some of her siblings she had therapy. Some of her problems, she says, are due to feeling abandoned by her parents. But there are other issues which she relates directly to the sibling bullying - a learned helplessness and a tendency to avoid conflict. This is a problem for her professionally, since her job sometimes requires her to turn down applications for funding, which means having tough conversations. "These are really difficult situations for me," she says. "It sucks to be a middle-aged woman and not know how to do this stuff that you're supposed to learn when you're a teenager." Some names have been changed to protect individuals' identity.

      <title>Oldest big cat fossil found in Tibet</title>
      <description>The skull of a four million-year-old big cat resembling a modern snow leopard has been found in the Himalayas, evidence that big cats first evolved in Asia not Africa.</description>

      <body>The oldest big cat fossils ever found - from a previously unknown species "similar to a snow leopard" - have been unearthed in the Himalayas. The skull fragments of the newly-named Panthera blytheae have been dated between 4.1 and 5.95 million years old. Their discovery in Tibet supports the theory that big cats evolved in central Asia - not Africa - and spread outward. The findings by US and Chinese palaeontologists are published in the Royal Society journal Proceedings B. They used both anatomical and DNA data to determine that the skulls belonged to an extinct big cat, whose territory appears to overlap many of the species we know today. "This cat is a sister of living snow leopards - it has a broad forehead and a short face. But it's a little smaller - the size of clouded leopards," said lead author Dr Jack Tseng of the University of Southern California. "This ties up a lot of questions we had on how these animals evolved and spread throughout the world. "Biologists had hypothesised that big cats originated in Asia. But there was a division between the DNA data and the fossil record." The so-called "big cats" - the Pantherinae subfamily - includes lions, jaguars, tigers, leopards, snow leopards, and clouded leopards. DNA evidence suggests they diverged from their cousins the Felinae - which includes cougars, lynxes, and domestic cats - about 6.37 million years ago. But the earliest fossils previously found were just 3.6 million years old - tooth fragments uncovered at Laetoli in Tanzania, the famous hominin site excavated by Mary Leakey in the 1970s. The new fossils were dug up on an expedition in 2010 in the remote Zanda Basin in southwestern Tibet, by a team including Dr Tseng and his wife Juan Liu - a fellow palaeontologist. They found over 100 bones deposited by a river eroding out of a cliff, including the crushed - but largely complete - remains of a big cat skull. "We were very surprised to find a cat fossil in that basin," Dr Tseng told BBC News. "Usually we find antelopes and rhinos, but this site was special. We found multiple carnivores - badgers, weasels and foxes." Among the bones were seven skull fragments, belonging to at least three individual cats, including one nearly complete skull. The fragments were dated using magnetostratigraphy - which relies on historical reversals in the Earth's magnetic field recorded in layers of rock. They ranged between 4.10 and 5.95 million years old, the complete skull being around 4.4 million years of age. "This is a very significant finding - it fills a very wide gap in the fossil record," said Dr Manabu Sakamoto of the University of Bristol, an expert on Pantherinae evolution. "The discovery presents strong support for the Asian origin hypothesis for the big cats. "It gives us a great insight into what early big cats may have looked like and where they may have lived." However, Prof William Murphy of Texas AandM University, another expert on the evolutionary relationship of big cats, questioned whether the new species was really a sister of the snow leopard. "The authors' claim that this skull is similar to the snow leopard is very weakly supported based on morphological characters alone, and this morphology-based tree is inconsistent with the DNA-based tree of living cats," he told BBC News. "It remains equally probable that this fossil is ancestral to the living big cats. More complete skeletons would be beneficial to confirm their findings." Dr Tseng and his team plan to return to the fossil site in Tibet next summer to search for more specimens. </body>

      <title>Vast iceberg poses risk to shipping</title>
      <description>UK researchers are awarded an emergency grant to track and predict a vast iceberg that could enter Southern Ocean shipping lanes.</description>

      <body>UK researchers have been awarded an emergency grant to track a vast iceberg in Antarctica that could enter shipping lanes. Latest images show several kilometres of water between the iceberg, estimated to be about 700 sq km (270 sq miles), and the glacier that spawned the block. The £50,000 award will fund a six-month project that will also predict its movement through the Southern Ocean. The icy giant broke away from the Pine Island Glacier (PIG) in July. "From the time it had been found that the crack had gone all the way across in July, it had stayed iced-in because it was still winter (in Antarctica)," explained principal investigator Grant Bigg from the University of Sheffield. "But in the last couple of days, it has begun to break away and now a kilometre or two of clear water has developed between it and the glacier." "It often takes a while for bergs from this area to get out of Pine Island Bay but once they do that they can either go eastwards along the coast or they can… circle out into the main part of the Southern Ocean. Prof Bigg told BBC News that one iceberg was tracked going through The Drake Passage - the body of water between South America's Cape Horn and Antarctica's South Shetland Islands. If the iceberg did follow this trajectory, it would bring the Singapore-size ice island into busy international shipping lanes. Eyes in the sky The team of scientists from Sheffield and the University of Southampton will use data from a number of satellites, including the German TerraSAR-X, which first alerted researchers at the Alfred Wegener Institute to the July calving. PIG is described as the longest and fastest flowing glacier in the Antarctic, with vast icebergs being calved from ice shelf every 6-10 years. Previous notable events occurred in 2007 and 2001. Scientists first noticed a spectacular crack spreading across the surface of the PIG in October 2011. As well as tracking the movement of the iceberg, Prof Bigg explained that the team also planned to predict its path through the Southern Ocean. "Part of the project is to try and simulate what we think the berg might do, given the... wind fields being experiencing in the region recently. He added that the team would attempt to predict possible tracks into the coming 12 months or so. If the berg did move towards or into shipping lanes then a warning would be issued via the services numerous ice hazard agencies around the world. </body>

      <title>Saturn photographed as Earth smiled</title>

      <body>The US space agency (Nasa) has released a spectacular new picture of the Planet Saturn, acquired by the Cassini spacecraft in July. The image was produced as part of The Day The Earth Smiled Project, which was led by Dr Carolyn Porco. She describes how and why the picture was put together. Four months ago, our cameras on Cassini were commanded to execute a routine imaging sequence during an event that was anything but routine. On 19 July, an array of overlapping images framing Saturn, its entire ring system and a host of its moons was acquired while Cassini was deep in the shadow created by the planet's eclipse of the Sun. This arrangement of Sun, Saturn, and machine made for a rare opportunity to image from the outer Solar System the planets in close to the Sun. The intent: To catch a precious glimpse of our own planet - tiny, remote, alone - as it would be seen from a billion miles away. Images of this nature had been taken before. The famous Voyager 1990 "Pale Blue Dot" image of Earth became, in the hands of Carl Sagan, a romantic allegory of the human condition and an inspirational call to environmental protection and planetary brotherhood. And Cassini's previous 2006 version, taken from Saturn orbit, showing the startling juxtaposition of our dot of a planet beside the enormity of Saturn's rings, became the most beloved Cassini image. But from the very start, the plans for the 19 July mosaic included something very special: If all went well, the images would capture a glimpse of Earth alongside Saturn and its rings at the very moment that people all over the globe would be contemplating their connectedness to each other and to all life on Earth, appreciating the rarity of our planet within the Solar System, marvelling at their own existence, and rejoicing at the very thought of having their picture taken from a billion miles away. And contemplate, appreciate, marvel and rejoice they did! From Pennsylvania: "What a great way to feel connected to the Universe, the planet, and every single person on it. We are truly all in this together." From the UK: "What a privilege to be part of such an event with so many people worldwide." From somewhere unknown: "At the appropriate time, I turned my face to the sky and spent a few minutes watching and listening to what life on Earth was like, right there. What a feeling of connection and oneness with the miracle that is life on Earth. This experience was beyond meaningful; it was transcendent. What a beautiful thing." From upstate New York: "I've been entranced by this project ever since I heard about it and was determined to join in the celebration. We may not be unique... we may be transient... we may be only flying along on a dust mote. But for 15 minutes, we were there, we were aware, and we smiled." After much work, the mosaic that marks that moment the inhabitants of Earth, including the four above, looked up wherever they were and smiled at the sheer joy of being alive, is finally here. In its combination of beauty and meaning, it is perhaps the most unusual image ever taken in the history of the space programme. Have a look and you will discover a universe of marvels. The brightly rimmed globe of Saturn and its main rings aglow with sunlight streaming through them take centre stage. On the left, embedded in the enormous, gossamer blue E ring, is the brilliant moon Enceladus, gleaming in the reflected light of Saturn and the sparkle of a hundred towering geysers, and likely the most promising place in all the Solar System to access alien life. A careful examination uncovers the shadow cast by this moon through the spray of smoke-sized icy particles created by those geysers, like a telephone pole might cast a shadow through a fog. Below and to the right of Enceladus is Tethys, a moon about a third the size of ours, illuminated by Saturn-shine. On the other side of the planet, to the upper right, is Mimas - only a crescent but also casting a faint shadow through the E ring. And on it goes - more moons and faint rings for anyone caring to take the time to wander. Now, look one more time. There, below the main rings and to the right of the globe of Saturn, far in the distance and seemingly lost in the radiance of the scene, lies a small speck of blue light, floating in a sea of stars. That is our home, with every last one of us on it - you, me, the folks down the block, even those on the opposite side of the Earth. We all inhabit that lovely blue dot. And more than this - the image of that dot captures the very moment, frozen in time, when the inhabitants of our planet took a break from their normal activities to go outside and acknowledge our "coming of age" as planetary explorers and the audacious interplanetary salute between robot and maker that this image represents. I hope long into the future, when people look again at this image, they will recall the moment when, as crazy as it might have seemed, they were there, they were aware, and they smiled. Dr Porco is the Imaging Team Leader on the Nasa/Esa/Asi Cassini mission. She was also instrumental in helping frame the Earth for its famous Pale Blue Dot portrait by Voyager.

      <description>Production of rice and coconuts hit dramatically as a result of the typhoon according to the UN's food and agriculture organisation.</description>

      <body>Over one million farmers in the Philippines have been impacted by Typhoon Haiyan according to the UN. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) says that hundreds of thousands of hectares of rice have been destroyed. Coconut plantations which are a big earner of foreign currency were said to be "completely flattened". Fishing communities have also be severely affected with the storm destroying boats and gear. The FAO says they have arrived at the figure of farmers affected by looking at the pathway the storm took as it passed across the country and from an analysis of data provided by the government. "That area is the major rice producing area for the Philippines," FAO's Jeff Tschirley told BBC News. "They've just finished their harvest and because it is not modernised production, they are still drying it but we suspect there is a lot of rice that is vulnerable to having been impacted by the storms." The farmers are also facing into the next planting season with much of their infrastructure such as irrigation equipment affected by the typhoon. The Philippines has been importing less rice over the past five years, but the storm will have dramatically changed that. "It will set them back on their goal of self sufficiency but more key is that those livelihoods will be pushed way back until they get restored irrigation infrastructure. That has been severely damaged in most cases," said Mr Tschirley. As well as rice and sugar cane, the FAO is most concerned about coconut plantations. Coconuts account for nearly half the Philippines agricultural exports and the country is the world's biggest producer of coconut oil. A smaller typhoon last year destroyed 500,000 tonnes. "The sugar cane fields can be recovered relatively well even if the harvest is lost," said Jeff Tschirley. "But numerous coconut plantations have been completely flattened, and with coconuts you are looking at multiple years to recover the productivity." The FAO is is calling for $24m for immediate interventions in fisheries and agriculture as part of the UN appeal. Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>Rotting flesh receptor discovered</title>
      <description>A team has found the specific olfactory receptor in zebrafish that responds to their innate aversion to rotting flesh.</description>

      <body>A team has found a smell receptor in zebrafish that explains their aversion to rotting flesh. Like zebra fish, humans are also disgusted by the smell of cadaverine, a volatile foul smelling molecule present when meat turns bad. But other animals that feed on rotting meat - such as bears and rats - find the molecule attractive. The researchers, writing journal PNAS, say the receptors are vital to help identify toxic food sources. Humans have millions of olfactory receptors but it remains unclear how many molecules that make up smells interact with the receptors. Now the one relating to cadaverine has been found. Sigrun Korsching from the University of Cologne, Germany, said that although many mammals have different smell preferences to humans, the zebrafish's olfactory systems are similar. "It signals danger, if a dead body is lying around maybe the danger is still around. It could also signal that the meat is toxic and should not be eaten," she told BBC News. Smell receptors are very powerful, they are present in the nose and are tasked with receiving the smell signals, sort of like an input channel for the nose. This signal is then evaluated into a meaningful smell by more powerful processes in the brain. "We have the two pillars of the bridge - the receptor of the peripheral end and the behaviour at the other end, but the bridge in-between, such which neural circuits are activated, we still don't know, but want to find out next." Cadaverine is the product that results when the amino acids in meat become degraded by bacteria. Toxins in the bacteria then infiltrate the meat. If, like the zebra fish, humans were not naturally repulsed by the smell of cadaverine, they might be more likely to eat bad meat. Uncovered chicken for example often goes bad before its sell by date, so it's an extremely helpful sense to have. The work was on zebrafish but the team says that humans could have a similar neural network. "It seems to be an innate awareness behaviour for the zebra fish. As far as I know it's also innate for humans. It's a case of convergent evolution." Prof Korsching added. "The old saying 'in biology nothing makes sense except in the light of evolution', I'm pretty sure that's the same here, even though it's hard to prove." Zebra fish are often used in research, from looking at reversing heart failure to motor neuron disease to developing a treatment for multiple sclerosis. The zebrafish genome has now also been mapped for the first time in the hope the stripy creatures could help scientists develop cures for a range of human diseases, as their genes mutate in similar ways to human genes. </body>

      <body>India's mission to Mars has overcome a technical problem and appears to be back on track, the country's space research agency says. The problem occurred on Monday when a planned engine burn failed to raise the spacecraft's orbit around Earth by the intended amount. The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) has now pushed the spacecraft to a higher orbit as planned. Isro officials said its final orbit "will be known in a few hours". The problem occurred during a manoeuvre designed to boost the craft's maximum distance from 71,623km to 100,000km. A problem with the liquid fuel thruster caused the 1,350kg vehicle to fall short of the mark. As a solution, the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) - known informally as Mangalyaan, or Mars-craft - executed an additional thruster firing to make up for the shortfall early on Tuesday. Speaking to Pallava Bagla, science editor at Indian broadcasting network NDTV, Isro's chairman K Radhakrishnan said: "All is well and operations completed as planned. The final orbit of the spacecraft will be known in a few hours." Mr Bagla told BBC News that the "spacecraft has been put on required velocity and seems to be on track". Instead of flying directly to Mars, the $72m (£45m) probe is scheduled to orbit Earth until the end of the month, building up the necessary velocity to break free from our planet's gravitational pull. </body>

      <description>The government's biodiversity offsetting plans are too simplistic and need to be strengthened if they are to "properly protect Britain's wildlife", MPs warn.</description>

      <body>Biodiversity offsetting plans outlined by the government must be strengthened if they are to "properly protect Britain's wildlife", MPs have warned. The scheme aims to ensure that when a development causes unavoidable damage to biodiversity, "new, bigger or better nature sites will be created". But the MPs say the assessment proposed by ministers appears to be little more than a "box-ticking exercise". Six areas are taking part in a two-year pilot, which began in April 2012. Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) chairwoman Joan Walley MP said many witnesses that gave evidence to the EAC's inquiry had voiced concerns that key habitats - such as ancient woodlands and Sites of Special Scientific Interest - would be included in the government's offsetting plans. 'Not adequate' "There is a danger that an overly simplistic offsetting system would not protect these long-established ecosystems," she added. "Biodiversity offsetting could improve the way our planning system accounts for the damage developments do to wildlife, if it is done well. "The assessment process currently proposed by the government appears to be little more than a 20-minute box-ticking exercise that is simply not adequate to assess a site's year-round biodiversity. Ms Walley explained: "If a 20-minute assessment was carried out in a British wood in winter, for instance, it would be easy to overlook many of the migratory birds that may use it as habitat in summer." However, in their report, the MPs acknowledged that it was "too soon to reach a decision" on offsetting while the pilot schemes had yet to be completed and independently evaluated. But they added that they were publishing their report now as ministers were considering submissions made during a public consultation on the proposals. The consultation on how the scheme would be rolled-out across England closed last week and officials are now considering the submissions. Responding to the EAC's findings, National Trust natural environment director Simon Pryor said the MPs' report showed that the government had to take its time to ensure to get the scheme right. "Offsetting could be a positive way to help avoid the loss of wildlife that can result from development - but only if it is done properly," he observed. "If a system is introduced too rapidly, and without adequate testing and evidence, the prospect of a workable and supportable biodiversity offsetting system would be undermined for many years to come." In its consultation document, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said that England faced "the twin challenges of growing its economy and improving its natural environment", adding: "We will not achieve these goals unless our planning system is fit-for-purpose." A Defra spokesman told BBC News: "Biodiversity offsetting could help improve our environment as well as boost the economy. "This report, along with other consultation responses, will help us get the detail of the policy right," he explained. "We will formally respond to the report in due course." A number of reports, produced by the Ecosystem Markets Task Force and the Natural Capital Committee, had identified biodiversity offsetting as a way of delivering a sustainable planning system. However, an independent review of England's wildlife sites, led by Prof Sir John Lawton, concluded in September 2010 that biodiversity offsetting must not become a "licence to destroy" or damage existing habitat of recognised value. "In other words, offsets must only be used to compensate for genuinely unavoidable damage," the review recommended. Defra said that offsetting schemes had been adopted in more than 20 countries, including Australia, Germany, India and the US, as a means of protecting biodiversity. Ms Walley also observed that the pilot schemes, which are scheduled to run until April 2014, had "not had a good take-up". "That suggests that these sorts of schemes need to be mandatory, but the government should exercise some caution about this because the pilots need to be rigorously and independently assessed first to make sure all the lesson are properly taken on board". </body>

      <title>Depression 'speeds ageing process'</title>
      <description>Depression can make us physically older by speeding up the ageing process in our cells, research suggests.</description>

      <body>Depression can make us physically older by speeding up the ageing process in our cells, according to a study. Lab tests showed cells looked biologically older in people who were severely depressed or who had been in the past. These visible differences in a measure of cell ageing called telomere length couldn't be explained by other factors, such as whether a person smoked. The findings, in more than 2,000 people, appear in Molecular Psychiatry. Experts already know that people with major depression are at increased risk of age-related diseases such as cancer, diabetes, obesity and heart disease. This might be partly down to unhealthy lifestyle behaviours such as alcohol use and physical inactivity. But scientists suspect depression takes its own toll on our cells. To investigate, Josine Verhoeven from the VU University Medical Centre in the Netherlands, along with colleagues from the US, recruited 2,407 people to take part in the study. More than one third of the volunteers were currently depressed, a third had experienced major depression in the past and the rest had never been depressed. The volunteers were asked to give a blood sample for the researchers to analyse in the lab for signs of cellular ageing. The researchers were looking for changes in structures deep inside cells called telomeres. Telomeres cap the end of our chromosomes which house our DNA. Their job is to stop any unwanted loss of this vital genetic code. As cells divide, the telomeres get shorter and shorter. Measuring their length is a way of assessing cellular ageing. People who were or had been depressed had much shorter telomeres than those who had never experienced depression. This difference was apparent even after lifestyle differences, such as heavy drinking and smoking, were taken into account. Furthermore, the most severely and chronically depressed patients had the shortest telomeres. Dr Verhoeven and colleagues speculate that shortened telomeres are a consequence of the body's reaction to the distress depression causes. "This large-scale study provides convincing evidence that depression is associated with several years of biological ageing, especially among those with the most severe and chronic symptoms," they say. But it is unclear whether this ageing process is harmful and if it can be reversed. UK expert Dr Anna Phillips, of the University of Birmingham, has researched the effects of stress on telomere length. She says telomere length does not consistently predict other key outcomes such as death risk. Further, it is likely that only a major depressive disorder, not experience of or even a lifetime of mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms, relates to telomere length, she said. </body>

      <title>Typhoon prompts climate 'fast'</title>

      <body>The head of the Philippines delegation at UN climate talks in Poland has said he will stop eating until participants make "meaningful" progress. In an emotional speech, Yeb Sano linked the "staggering" devastation caused by Typhoon Haiyan to a changing climate. Mr Sano said he was speaking on behalf of those who lost their lives in the storm and his fast would last until "we stop this madness". His speech brought tears to the eyes of other delegates and a standing ovation. Mr Sano said the typhoon had made land near his home area, and he had just had word that members of his family had survived. At the opening of the two-week Conference of the Parties (Cop), Mr Sano said he was not just speaking for those who lost their lives but for the thousands who were now orphans. He told the meeting he would refuse to eat until progress is made. "In solidarity with my countrymen who are struggling to find food back home, I will now commence a voluntary fasting for the climate, this means I will voluntarily refrain from eating food during this Cop, until a meaningful outcome is in sight." "What my country is going through as a result of this extreme climate event is madness, the climate crisis is madness. We can stop this madness right here in Warsaw," he said. Mr Sano's intervention unleashed a wave of emotion in the normally staid surroundings of the UN conference. China proposed three minutes of silence in memory of the victims. Delegates stood, some with tears in their eyes as they reflected on the scale of human loss in the super storm. Earlier the UN's climate chief, Christiana Figueres, had opened the meeting saying the typhoon was part of the "sobering reality" and negotiators should go the "extra mile" in their efforts. Speaking at the conference centre at the national football stadium in Warsaw, Ms Figueres reminded the delegates that climate change was not a game. "There are no winners and losers, we all either win or lose in the future we make for ourselves." Participants from small island states said the typhoon served as a stark reminder of "the cost of inaction". In a statement, Olai Ngedikes the lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis) said that the storm should motivate the work in Warsaw. She said that discussions on the issue of loss and damage, a key element for developing countries, must proceed at pace. "It has become clear that there are now impacts from climate change that can no longer be avoided. "It is therefore essential that we establish an international mechanism on loss and damage here in Warsaw and address this crisis once and for all," she said. Despite their sympathy for the situation in the Philippines, developed nations are likely to resist a formal, legal basis for future loss and damage claims associated with climate change.

      <body>A camel has tested positive for the Sars-like virus that emerged in the Middle East last year and has killed 64 people worldwide. The animal had been owned by a person diagnosed with Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) coronavirus, the Saudi health ministry said. It remains unclear, however, if camels are responsible for passing the disease to humans. Coronaviruses cause respiratory infections in humans and animals. It is possible the virus is spread in droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Experts believe the virus is not very contagious - if it were, we would have seen more cases. Globally, since September 2012, there have been 153 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Mers coronavirus. The Saudi government statement said "preliminary" laboratory checks had proved positive. The health ministry said it was working with the ministry of agriculture and laboratories to "isolate the virus and compare its genetic structure with that of the patient's". If the virus carried by the camel and that of the patient "prove to be identical, this would be a first scientific discovery worldwide, and a door to identify the source of the virus", it added. The World Health Organization, which has been monitoring the global situation, says there is currently no reason to impose any travel restrictions because of the virus. </body>

      <body>Disgraced former cyclist Lance Armstrong has told the BBC he will testify with "100% transparency and honesty" at any future inquiry into doping. But the American, 42, wants assurances he will be treated fairly after admitting in January he took performance-enhancing drugs during all seven of his Tour de France wins. He argues some of those involved in cycling's culture of doping have been given "a total free pass", while others have received "the death penalty". Accused by the United States Anti-Doping Agency of conducting "the most sophisticated, professionalised and successful doping programme sport has ever seen", Armstrong was stripped of his Tour de France titles in August 2012. The Texan, who overcame cancer before the first of his seven successive Tour "wins" in 1999, also handed back the bronze medal he won in the road time trial at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. In a 20-minute interview with the BBC's World Service's Newshour programme, Armstrong said his life had "been tough" following his high-profile television confession to American chat show host Oprah Winfrey at the start of the year. He also spoke of the mounting threat to his vast fortune, reported to be about $125m (£78m) at its peak, as people seek redress for the lies he told. "It's been tough," he said. "It's been real tough. I've paid a high price in terms of my standing within the sport, my reputation, certainly financially because the lawsuits have continued to pile up. "I have experienced massive personal loss, massive loss of wealth, while others have truly capitalised on this story." Asked if he regretted doing the interview with Winfrey, he responded: "I was going to have to answer the questions anyway. "There were plenty of lawsuits in place that would have put me in the cross-hairs." Armstrong said what he wanted now was consistency from those attempting to find out the true extent of the doping. "If everyone gets the death penalty, then I'll take the death penalty," he said. "If everyone gets a free pass, I'm happy to take a free pass. If everyone gets six months, then I'll take my six months." Brian Cookson, the new president of the UCI - cycling's world governing body, said there will be an independent commission to try to unearth how much cheating there had been. The Englishman is keen the commission hears evidence from a large number of people, not just Armstrong, as he attempts to restore cycling's credibility and that of his own organisation, which has faced allegations of corruption. Armstrong said he would do whatever he could to "close the chapter and move things forward", conceding he did not have "a whole lot of credibility" but also insisting he had "nothing to lose". He has previously questioned the role of the UCI, claiming "there were things that were a little shady" at the time. However, he told the BBC any revelations might not be "quite as juicy" as people think. Armstrong, who finally retired from cycling in 2011 after initially quitting in 2005, also issued a warning about the inquiry itself, arguing the logistics would be problematic both "legally and internationally". He also questioned how much good attempting to find out the truth would do. "Do I think that this process has been good for cycling?" he asked. "No. I don't think our sport has been served well by going back 15 years. "I don't think that any sport, or any political scenario, is well served going back 15 years. And if you go back 15 years, you might as well go back 30." As for whether cycling is clean now, Armstrong insisted he had "no idea". However, he argued that "performance enhancement" has been around since the ancient Greeks and there would "always be some form of it", adding the World Anti-Doping Agency had a "hard" job keeping up with the cheats "because of the development of pharmaceuticals". Armstrong would not be drawn on whether it was time for a radical approach to drugs in sport, perhaps permitting thresholds rather than outright bans. "That's way above my pay-grade to try to decide that," he said. "I'll let those people who pretend to be, or who are the experts, try to decide that." </body>

      <title>Chemical ban linked to warming pause</title>
      <description>A new study links a ban on the uses of ozone depleting chemicals to a hiatus in temperature rises since the mid 1990s.</description>

      <body>A new study suggests that the ban on ozone depleting chemicals may have also impacted the rise in global temperatures. CFC gases were responsible for a massive hole in the ozone layer but they also had a powerful greenhouse effect. The authors link a ban on their use to a "pause" or slowdown in temperature increases since the mid 1990s. The research is published in the journal Nature Geoscience. The subject of a hiatus or standstill in global temperatures rises since 1998 has been the subject of intense debate among scientists, and it has been used as a key argument by some to show that the impacts of global warming have been exaggerated. There have been a number of theories as to why the rise in emissions from CO2 and other gases has not been mirrored in temperatures since the late 1990s. These include increases in China's use of coal, changes in solar output, and the impact of the El Nino weather cycle. One report earlier this year suggested that it was caused by long-term changes in the warming of waters in the eastern Pacific. Now this latest piece of research says that it has been caused by attempts to protect the ozone layer. A team of researchers carried out a statistical analysis on the connection between rising temperatures and rates of increase in concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere between 1880 and 2010. They concluded that changes in the warming rate can be attributed to specific human actions that affected greenhouse gas concentrations. They were able to show that when emissions were reduced during both world wars and the Great Depression, temperature rises also stalled. They also argue that the introduction of the Montreal Protocol, originally signed in 1987 by 46 countries, had an impact on global temperatures as well. The treaty phased out the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). These chemicals, used as spray can propellants and in refrigeration, had helped thin the ozone layer over Antarctica. But CFCs were not just damaging the ozone layer, they were also having a warming impact, as they are 10,000 times more powerful than carbon dioxide and can last up to 100 years in the atmosphere. Their removal, say the authors, was a critical factor in the slowdown. "Our analysis suggests that the reduction in the emissions of ozone-depleting substances under the Montreal Protocol, as well as a reduction in methane emissions, contributed to the lower rate of warming since the 1990s," the authors write. In a commentary on the research, Felix Pretis and Prof Myles Allen from Oxford University suggest that the CFC ban is "unlikely to be the whole story", but they acknowledge it did make a difference. "The impact of this change is small but not negligible: without the reduction in CFC emissions, temperatures today could have been almost 0.1C warmer than they actually are."

      <body>An electrical current capable of charging a mobile phone has been created from microwave signals. A team from Duke University said the technology they had used had been as efficient as using solar panels. The device they created used metamaterials, which capture various forms of wave energy and convert them for other applications. In the future, satellite, sound or wi-fi signals could be "harvested", according to the US researchers. "We're showing... these materials can be useful for consumer applications," said engineering student Alexander Katko. Using fibreglass and copper conductors on a circuit board, the researchers converted microwaves into 7.3 volts of electricity. A USB charger, which is often used to recharge mobile phone batteries and cameras, provides about five volts. "We were aiming for the highest energy efficiency we could achieve," said team member Allen Hawkes. "We had been getting energy efficiency around 6-10%, but with this design we were able to dramatically improve energy conversion to 37%, which is comparable to what is achieved in solar cells." Metamaterials are artificial materials that display properties not usually found in nature. In future, the two students and their colleague Steven Cummer hope that the technology can be built in to mobile phones. This would allow the handsets to recharge wirelessly when not being used. They also believe that it could help users living in remote areas without access to the power grid. They would be able to "harvest" the energy from signals generated by mobile phone towers. "Our work demonstrates a simple and inexpensive approach to electromagnetic power harvesting," said Mr Cummer. "The beauty of the design is that the basic building blocks are self-contained and additive. One can simply assemble more blocks to increase the scavenged power." The full report will be published in the journal Applied Physics Letters in December. </body>

      <title>New invisibility cloak type designed</title>
      <description>A new "broadband" invisibility cloak which hides objects over a much wider range of frequencies has been devised by US scientists.</description>

      <body>A new "broadband" invisibility cloak which hides objects over a wide range of frequencies has been devised. Despite the hype about Harry Potter-style cloaks, our best current designs can only conceal objects at specific wavelengths of light or microwaves. At other frequencies, invisibility cloaks actually make things more visible, not less, US physicists found. Their solution is a new ultrathin, electronic system, which they describe in Physical Review Letters. "Our active cloak is a completely new concept and design, aimed at beating the limits of [current cloaks] and we show that it indeed does," said Prof Andrea Alu, from the University of Texas at Austin. "If you want to make an object transparent at all angles and over broad bandwidths, this is a good solution. "We are looking into realising this technology at the moment, but we are still at the early stages." While the popular image of an invisibility cloak is the magical robe worn by Harry Potter, there is another kind which is not so far-fetched. The first working model - which concealed a small copper cylinder by bending microwaves around it - was first demonstrated in 2006. It was built with a thin shell of metamaterials - artificial composites whose structures allow properties which do not exist in nature. Cloaking materials could have applications in the military, microscopy, biomedical sensing, and energy harvesting devices. The trouble with current designs is they only work at limited bandwidths. Even this "perfect" 3D cloak demonstrated last year could only hide objects from microwaves. At other frequencies the cloak acts as a beacon - making the hidden object more obvious - as Prof Alu and his team have now demonstrated in a new study in Physical Review X. They looked at three popular types of "passive" cloaks - which do not require electricity - a plasmonic cloak, a mantle cloak, and a transformation-optics cloak. All three types scattered more waves than the bare object they were trying to hide - when tested over the whole range of the electromagnetic spectrum. "If you suppress scattering in one range, you need to pay the price, with interest, in some other range," Prof Alu told BBC News. "For example, you might make a cloak that makes an object invisible to red light. But if you were illuminated by white light (containing all colours) you would actually look bright blue, and therefore stand out more." A cloak that allows complete invisibility is "impossible" with current passive designs, the study concluded. "When you add material around an object to cloak it, you can't avoid the fact that you are adding matter, and that this matter still responds to electromagnetic waves," Prof Alu explained. Instead, he said, a much more promising avenue is "active" cloaking technology - designs which rely on electrical power to make objects "vanish". Active cloaks can be thinner and less conspicuous than passive cloaks. Alu's team have proposed a new design which uses amplifiers to coat the surface of the object in an electric current. This ultrathin cloak would hide an object from detection at a frequency range "orders of magnitude broader" than any available passive cloaking technology, they wrote. Prof David Smith of Duke University, one of the team who created the first cloak in 2006, said the new design was one of the most detailed he had yet seen. "It's an interesting implementation but as presented is probably a bit limited to certain types of objects," he told BBC News. "There are limitations even on active materials. It will be interesting to see if it can be experimentally realised." Prof Smith points out that even an "imperfect" invisibility cloak might be perfectly sufficient to build useful devices with real-world applications. For example, a radio-frequency cloak could improve wireless communications - by helping them bypass obstacles and reducing interference from neighbouring antennas. "To most people, making an object 'invisible' means making it transparent to visible wavelengths. And the visible spectrum is a tiny, tiny sliver of the overall electromagnetic spectrum," he told BBC News. "So, this finding does not necessarily preclude the Harry Potter cloak, nor does it preclude any other narrow bandwidth application of cloaking." </body>

      <body>A US company that has developed an "electronic backpack" that fits onto a cockroach allowing its movements to be controlled by a mobile phone app has defended itself against cruelty claims. The Backyard Brains company says that the device is intended to get children to be interested in neuroscience. A spokeswoman told the BBC that the device - being formally launched on Saturday - was not a gimmick. But critics say that the company's stance is "disingenuous". For the "electronic backpack" to work the cockroaches have to be placed in icy water to subdue them before sandpaper is used to remove the waxy coating on the shell of the insect's head. An electrode connector and electrodes are then glued on to the insect's body and a needle is used to poke a hole in their thorax in order to insert a wire. Their antennae are then cut and electrodes are inserted. A circuit is attached to their backs, and signals are received through a mobile phone app allowing users to control the cockroaches' movements to the left and to the right. Animal behaviour scientist Jonathan Balcombe has been quoted on US scientific websites as saying that the insects are harmed in the process. "If it was discovered that a teacher was having students use magnifying glasses to burn ants and then look at their tissue, how would people react?" he is quoted as saying. Likewise Queen's University philosophy Professor Michael Allen warned that the device will "encourage amateurs to operate invasively on living organisms" and "encourage thinking of complex living organisms as mere machines or tools". The Michigan-based company has even received emails saying the the backpack - known as Roboroach - "teaches kids to be psychopaths". But Backyard Brains says that 20% of the world will soon have a neurological disorder - for which there are no known cures - and the backpacks "allow students to do graduate level research early in life". A company spokeswoman told the BBC that the backpack had been developed solely to encourage children to take an interest in neuroscience which, she said, needed to be better taught in American schools. "At the moment this crucially important subject is woefully under-taught," she said, "with many schools teaching neuroscience within the biology syllabus when it should be a subject in its own right. "That is especially the case when diseases of the brain such as Alzheimer's take a heavier toll within society." The spokeswoman insisted that the insects are treated humanely and that the backpack - first developed in 2011 - does not harm them. The backpack will be widely available in November in the US priced at $99 (£61). </body>

      <title>'Space Ferrari' falls to Earth</title>
      <description>The European Space Agency's Goce gravity mapping satellite re-enters the Earth's atmosphere, burning up over the South Atlantic.</description>

      <body>The European Space Agency's (Esa) Goce satellite has re-entered the Earth's atmosphere, burning up in the process. US tracking data suggests any surviving debris fell into the South Atlantic, just off the tip of South America, south of the Falkland Islands. Dubbed the "Ferrari of space" because of its sleek looks, Goce is the first Esa mission to make an uncontrolled re-entry in more than 25 years. The gravity mapping probe's plunge was inevitable once it ran out of fuel. The mission was operating in an extremely low orbit - at 224km altitude, the lowest of any scientific satellite - and needed to constantly thrust an electric engine to stay aloft, but last month its reserves of xenon fuel were exhausted. Pre-return modelling had indicated that perhaps a fifth to a quarter of Goce's one-tonne mass could have endured the fiery fall through the atmosphere. Its sophisticated gradiometer - the instrument used to make gravity measurements - incorporated composite materials which were expected to ride out the destructive forces that would ordinarily incinerate traditional components. The Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee - the global forum on "space junk" - chose Goce as its special study project for 2013. This meant a large number of tracking and surveillance facilities around the world were activated to monitor the satellite's descent to Earth. A signal from Goce was last acquired at 22:42 GMT on Sunday as it passed 121km (75 miles) above Antarctica. Data from the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) indicated that re-entry occurred a little over one orbit of the Earth later, with the spacecraft starting to break up at 00:16 GMT on Monday at an altitude of about 80km. This would have put any debris fall in the South Atlantic just east of Tierra Del Fuego. "Goce survived for a few minutes longer than we expected - but since re-entries are difficult to predict, this is not very surprising," Holger Krag from Esa's Space Debris Office told BBC News. Goce's slender, fin-shaped construction, combined with its magnetic attitude-control system, maintained a stable orientation until very late in the descent. Engineers monitoring the last hours of the satellite from Europe's Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, observed Goce to keep a straight-on approach as it dipped deeper and deeper into the atmosphere. "This was due to the shape of Goce, which was designed in such a way that it was aerodynamically stabilised," said Dr Krag. Statistics show that there is typically at least one piece of tracked space "junk" re-entering the Earth's atmosphere every day; with, on average, one intact defunct spacecraft or old rocket body coming back every week. Esa's last mission to make an uncontrolled re-entry was the magnetosphere explorer Isee-2, which came back in 1987. The agency does, however, regularly manage controlled re-entries. Its space station freighter, the Automated Transfer Vehicle, can weigh some 13 tonnes when it comes back to Earth. It has fuel and thrusters to direct its destructive dive towards the vast and uninhabited waters of the Southern Ocean, east of New Zealand. Goce (Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer) was launched in 2009 as part of a series of innovative environmental research satellites. Its super-sensitive gradiometer was used to detect the tiny variations in the pull of gravity across the surface of the Earth. Its maps have very broad applications. The data is a key reference in civil engineering for relating heights measured at widely separated locations, and for the computer models that need to understand how the oceans move to forecast future changes in climate. </body>

      <body>The Hubble telescope has spotted an asteroid radiating six comet-like tails, making it resemble a "rotating lawn sprinkler". Other asteroids appear as tiny points of light to astronomers, who are puzzled by the outbursts of dust. Asteroid P/2013 P5 has been ejecting dust periodically for at least five months and may be in the process of breaking up. They have outlined details in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters. "We were literally dumbfounded when we saw it," said Prof Dave Jewitt, from the University of California at Los Angeles. "Even more amazing, its tail structures change dramatically in just 13 days as it belches out dust. That also caught us by surprise. It's hard to believe we're looking at an asteroid." Astronomers say it is possible the asteroid's rotation rate increased to the point where its surface started flying apart. Radiation pressure from the Sun could have sent the space rock spinning, to a point where the asteroid's weak gravity could no longer hold it together. Astronomers will continue observing P/2013 P5 to see whether the dust leaves the asteroid in the equatorial plane. Because of the physics involved in the spin rate theory, say the astronomers, this would provide strong evidence for a rotational breakup. They do not believe the tails are the result of an impact with another asteroid because they have not seen a large quantity of dust blasted into space all at once. Astronomers discovered the object in August, using the Pan-STARRS telescope in Hawaii. At the time, P/2013 P5 looked unusually fuzzy. The multiple tails were discovered when Hubble was used to take a more detailed image on 10 September. </body>

      <body>A Soyuz capsule has returned to Earth, carrying the Sochi 2014 Olympic torch after it was taken on its first spacewalk as part of the Russian lead-up to the Winter Games. The torch landed in central Kazakhstan after leaving the International Space Station. Three astronauts delivered it back after a three-and-a-half hour descent. The torch was taken up to the ISS on Thursday and then waved outside the space station. Russian cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergei Ryazansky posed for photographs as they held the torch 420km (260 miles) above Earth. The Olympic torch has been carried into space twice before - in 1996 and 2000 - but it had never previously left a spaceship. The torch was unlit inside the ISS because of safety concerns and outside due to the lack of oxygen. A different crew - Russia's Fyodor Yurchikhin, Nasa US astronaut Karen Nyberg and Italian Luca Parmitano - bought it back to Earth, landing on the Kazakh steppes shortly before 08:50 (02:50 GMT) on Monday. The capsule descended to the ground under a parachute. Mr Yurchikhin, the mission commander, was carried from the capsule to a reclining chair and covered with blanket against the cold. The torch was removed from a protective bag and given to Mr Yurchikhin, who waved it and smiled for the cameras. The capsule completed a perfect descent and touched down exactly on time, according to a Nasa TV commentator. It will to be used to light the Olympic cauldron at the winter games in February next year. The trip to the space station is all part of elaborate preparations for Russia's first Olympics since the Soviet era. It was seen as part of a rebranding exercise by Russia designed to portray it as a strong, modern country. The Games are the most expensive Olympics so far, costing around $50bn (£31bn; 1,620bn roubles). The run-up to the Games has been marred by controversy over a new Russian law that restricts the spread of information about homosexuality, as well as by allegations from rights groups that authorities have rounded up migrant workers who helped build the Games venues in Sochi. </body>

      <body>Scientists are looking for 100,000 volunteers prepared to have their DNA sequenced and published online for anyone to look at. The UK Personal Genome Project could provide a massive free tool for scientists to further understanding of disease and human genetics. Participants will get an analysis of their DNA, but so will the rest of the world, and anonymity is not guaranteed. They are warned there could be unknown consequences for them and relatives. Unlocking the secrets of DNA could transform the understanding of disease. A deeper understanding of Alzheimer's disease is emerging by looking for differences in the DNA of people with and without the disease. Prof George Church, who runs the US version of the project, said analysing 100,000 genomes could lead to advances in common diseases such as diabetes. He said: "We're finding more and more of these common diseases are a collection of rare diseases. "Cancer used to be a disease, then it broke up into lots of different diseases by tissue, then lots of sub-categories based on the genes that are impacted, so now it's thousands of diseases." Participants will have to pass tests to prove they fully understand the risks of making their genetic identities freely available for the world to use before taking part. There will be immediate risks and those that emerge as genetic technology advances including: Dr Peter Mills, who is investigating the ethical issues around biological and health data with the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, told the BBC: "The difference with genetic data is you're not just committing yourself to something you might not fully envisage, but you're also implicating biological relatives. "There is potentially huge public benefit, but there is the potential for it to rebound, but how that rebounds on the person, families and those yet to be born is very difficult to know." Cian Murphy, a 24-year-old PhD student at University College London, wants to take part. He said: "Very few people live their whole lives not affected by some genetic illness, your sample could be the difference between a cure being discovered or not." As part of the study, participants will find out intimate details about their genome, such as the presence of any high-risk breast-cancer genes. They will be given a list of doctors they can go to if they need further medical advice. While people will not have their name published, studies have shown it is possible to work out someone's identity from genetic databases and other public records. Dr David King, from the group Human Genetics Alert, said: "Human Genetics Alert would strongly advise people not to give their genetic information to a project which will share it with the world. "Once your data is online, you will never be able to recall it. The project's informed-consent procedures are not valid, because they do not tell you all of the risks. That is not informed consent." He warned the data could be used for any purpose including those people objected to ethically and said there was "no reason" for it to be public. Meanwhile, the government's Genomics England project is trying to sequence 100,000 NHS patient's DNA, which is private and carries a threat of legal action if patients are identified. Sir John Chisholm, executive chairman of Genomics England, said: "We would want anyone consenting to their DNA being used for sequencing to have a clear understanding of what they are contributing to, and to do so on a voluntary basis which we understand will be the case with Personal Genome Project. "Anyone who takes part in any initiative that involves giving a DNA sample for sequencing should be as clear at the time of giving their consent as they can be of how that sample will be used, and who will have access to it, and what future purposes it can be put to." </body>

      <title>Volcanic lava that flows for a year</title>
      <description>Researchers capture the first footage of the glacial flow of rocky obsidian lava, still flowing months after an eruption.</description>

      <body>An explosive volcanic eruption in Chile has given scientists the first direct insight into the strange motion of rocky lava known as obsidian flow. Rather than a red river of molten rock oozing down a mountainside, this lava is a thick, rubble-strewn mass of rock. Dr Hugh Tuffen, from the University of Lancaster, and his colleagues took the first measurements of this lava flow. They found that it kept moving more than a year after the eruption. Their results were published in the journal Nature Communications. To carry out their study, the team visited a volcano in the south of Chile called Cordon Caulle in January 2012. "There had just been an enormous eruption [in June 2011] that was still continuing," Dr Tuffen told BBC News. This explosive eruption produced rhyolite - the rock that creates the "incredibly sticky magma" that results in these strange obsidian flows. "This was our chance to get right in there and see an obsidian flow moving for the first time," he said. No-one had previously witnessed an obsidian flow moving. As well as witnessing the ongoing volcanic eruption, the researchers recorded the lava - a heaving mass of black rock more than 30m (100ft) thick - as it "slowly creaked its way down the mountain". Team member Prof Jonathan Castro from the University of Mainz in Germany captured footage and images of the flow. Piecing these images together produced a 3-D model of the obsidian flow's changing shape. "What was exciting was that it kept on going," said Dr Tuffen. "Even after the eruption had stopped - it was still flowing away many months afterwards." Initially, the lava advanced several metres per day, then as its thick rocky crust cooled, it slowed. But, according to Dr Tuffen's data, over a year after the eruption, the lava was still advancing at a rate of 1.5m to 3m per day. Crucially, the lava flow altered as pieces of the rocky mass collapsed and the hotter lava leaked out in what the scientists referred to as "breakouts". This, Dr Tuffen said, revealed "lots of secrets about how lavas advance". "So now we can make new models that can encompass all the different sorts of lavas on the planet and how they move." Dr William Burton, of the US Geological Survey, said: "What these guys have done is observe processes along the margins that may govern how these things flow - the breakouts. "Knowing what they learned in this paper may help predict where this flow is going to go next. "So if it is going close to a town you might be able to use some of the lessons they learned to [work out changes in its movement]." Dr Burton added that the most likely place for the next rhyolitic volcanic eruption was near Mono lake, in northern California - a popular ski area. Prof Peter Sammonds, an earth scientist from University College London, said the imaging techniques the team had developed would be "powerful" for the future study of volcanoes. "The modelling of these lava flows is quite important," he said. "These patterns can seen as a general feature [of volcanoes] - it doesn't simply relate to this one. Volcanoes that have produced rhyolitic eruptions are found all over the world, and have been some of the biggest on Earth. These include the US "supervolcano" eruptions at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, and Novarupta in Alaska, which erupted in 1912 and was the biggest of the 20th Century. </body>

      <title>Rat cull to 'save seabirds' begins</title>
      <description>Internationally important seabird populations on the Isles of Scilly are being protected by a scheme to kill more than 3,000 brown rats.</description>

      <body>A project aimed at protecting internationally important seabird populations on two of the Isles of Scilly by killing more than 3,000 brown rats, is under way. The islands, which are located off Cornwall, are home to breeding populations of 14 seabird species and approximately 20,000 birds. Eradication experts from New Zealand and the UK have been contracted to carry out the work. "Among many challenges our seabirds face, the greatest threat on land is predation of eggs and chicks by brown rats," said Jaclyn Pearson from the Isles of Scilly Seabird Recovery Project. "The brown rats were accidently introduced to islands from shipwrecks in the 18th Century," she added. The project is part of a 25-year programme to protect "internationally important" seabird numbers, including those of Manx shearwaters and storm petrels, and is costing more than £755,000. The rodents will be poisoned on St Agnes and Gugh by Wildlife Management International Limited (WMIL). The company has helped eradicate rats from Ramsey Island off Wales, Lundy Island off Devon and the Isle of Canna in the Scottish Hebrides. Elizabeth Bell, from WMIL said: "A period of intensive baiting will start from the 8 November and most of the rats will be dead by the end of November. We'll then target the surviving rats." A long-term monitoring programme will start at the beginning of 2014 to check the rodents have been eradicated from the islands. Ms Bell said all the bait stations were enclosed, tied down and were designed not to kill any other species, such as rabbits. Ms Pearson said: "The project is 25 years in length, although the project team will disband after five years, for the remaining 20 years the community will continue to protect their seabird heritage, by keeping the islands 'rat-free'. "This includes correct waste management, ensuring bio-security on boats and freight to the islands, and of course, educating all visitors to the islands to be vigilant and 'rat on a rat'". "This is the largest community-based island restoration project attempted in the world to date, with 85 residents living here year round." She added that similar populated islands around the world hoped to learn from the project and carry out similar work to "safeguard their seabirds". A feasibility study estimated the population of brown rats on the Isles of Scilly was about 34,500, with 3,100 occurring on St Agnes and Gugh. Johnny Birks, chair of the Mammal Society, said: "Brown rats are not native to Britain... it's our own fault they are so widespread and that makes it right for us to repair the damage we've caused." He added that the eradication could benefit the Scilly shrew and other species found on the islands, but it was key that the rats did not reinvade. Ms Pearson added she was "certain" rats on neighbouring islands would not swim to St Agnes and Gugh. "The shortest distance over water from St Agnes and Gugh to an island which has rats, is between Gugh and the Garrison on St Mary's. "This distance of about one mile (1.6km) is just under the maximum distance a rat can swim in favourable conditions, but the deep channel, strong current and cold sea temperature all year round will make it highly unlikely that a rat can swim back." Tony Whitehead, from the RSPB, said: "Eight out of ten islands around the world now have rats, including remote places such as Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic and Henderson Island in the South Pacific. "The predators are known to have impacted on the populations of 75 species of seabird, from albatross to shearwaters to small petrels. "In response, there is a worldwide effort to rid islands of these voracious creatures," he added. In January, Richard Bellamy, head of the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) South West, said we have a "collective responsibility for the native wildlife on the Isles of Scilly". HLF has awarded the project £269,100, alongside £460,255 from the EU Life fund , with further contributions from Isles of Scilly Area of Outstanding Beauty Sustainable Development Fund and Natural England. </body>

      <title>Fossil fuel subsidies 'are reckless'</title>
      <description>A new study suggests the world is spending seven times more money subsidising fossil fuels than fighting climate change in developing countries.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24833153</url>

      <body>The world is spending half a trillion dollars on fossil fuel subsidies every year, according to a new report. The Overseas Development Institute (ODI) says rich countries are spending seven times more supporting coal, oil and gas than they are on helping poorer nations fight climate change. Some countries including Egypt, Morocco and Pakistan, have subsidies bigger than the national fiscal deficit. The new report calls on the G20 to phase out the payments by 2020. While there is no globally agreed definition of what a fossil fuel subsidy actually is, the report draws on a range of sources from the International Monetary Fund to the International Energy Agency. It details the range of financial help given to oil, coal and gas producers and consumers from national governments and through international development. What emerges is a complicated web of different types of payments in different countries. In the United States, for example, the government in 2011 gave a $1bn fuel tax exemption to farmers, $1bn for the strategic petroleum reserve and $0.5bn for oil, coal and gas research and development. Germany gave financial assistance totalling 1.9bn euro to the hard coal sector in the same year. And the UK gave tax concessions worth £280m in 2011 for oil and gas production. The report accuses rich governments of "shooting themselves in both feet" by undermining attempts to put a price on carbon and by giving no incentive to companies to switch from high carbon fuels. "This is a reckless use of public money at a time when people are very concerned about energy costs," Kevin Watkins, executive director of the ODI, told BBC News. "Why are we spending $112 per adult in the OECD countries subsidising an energy system that is driving us towards dangerous climate change when there are alternatives?" In developing countries, the report says the subsidies often take the form of keeping fuel prices low to help alleviate poverty. Governments in Indonesia, Pakistan and Venezuela are spending twice as much on fossil fuel subsidies as they are on public health. "Almost all these subsidies go to those who are connected to the grid because the governments give money to the energy providers, who pass it on to consumers. "The top 20% of these societies get around half of the total subsidy package," said Kevin Watkins. International finance for development is hugely focussed on oil, coal and gas. According to the ODI, 75% of energy project support from international banks went to fossil fuel projects in 12 of the highest emitting developing nations. The research adds to data from the International Energy Agency that says global subsidies for fossil fuels are six times higher than those for renewable energy. The OECD has stated that coal is subject to the lowest levels of taxation. The ODI hopes that enough countries in the G20 group will follow up on promises made to look at the issue. The institute believes that subsidies for energy are similar to subsidies for agriculture that plagued international trade negotiations in the 1990s. Ultimately, agreement was found on removing them. The ODI believes there can be a similar outcome for fuel supports. "This has to be the mother of all win-win scenarios," said Kevin Watkins. "You'd have a win for taxpayers, a win for governments north and south and you'd have a win for the planet as well." Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc. </body>

      <title>Climate wavering 'not justified'</title>
      <description>Government advisers say the UK is not out of step with major nations in reducing emissions.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24834697</url>

      <body>Britain is playing its part in a worldwide bid to reduce emissions and should not weaken its proposed cuts, says a report to the UK government. The Committee on Climate Change says no change in global science or policy justifies a slackening of effort. The report was compiled after Chancellor George Osborne said the UK's competitiveness might be put at risk by leading the world in curbing emissions. The CCC research challenges this assumption. "It is not accurate to say that the UK is leading the world on this," the CCC’s chief executive David Kennedy told BBC News. "We aren’t acting alone. We have made ambitious commitments, but other countries have too – they are acting on them and developing low-carbon technologies. "Some of our European counterparts are discussing targets stricter than ours for 2030 so if we want to be part of the low-carbon revolution we will have to make sure we aren’t left behind." Mr Kennedy said China was now clearly global leader in clean technology: "China is leading the low-carbon revolution. It has committed to invest in 700 Gigawatts of renewable power generation by 2020 – that’s 10 times the whole UK power system. "They are investing in five million electric vehicles – in multiples of what we are doing here. “Even the US is cutting its emissions and is committed to doing so in coming years.” The shale gas revolution in the US has forced down emissions because gas is much less polluting than coal; the report says it is likely that the US will meet its commitment to reduce 2020 emissions by 17% on 2005 levels. It points out that China has committed to reduce carbon-intensity by 40-45% from 2005 to 2020, and introduced policies to deliver in its 12th five-year plan. With ongoing action, China’s emissions could peak in the early 2020s, the report says. It says Germany has also made medium-term commitments in line with the UK. But Mr Kennedy admitted that the world’s efforts were still nowhere near enough to keep the world on track for a high likelihood of a stable climate. The World Meteorological Organization has announced that greenhouse gases has reached another record. UNEP’s Emissions Gap report also warned that delaying emissions cuts would make the task even more expensive. The CCC was founded to advise government on how to meet the Climate Change Act, which commits the UK to reducing CO2 80% by 2050, in a step-by-step process. For several years the Chancellor has expressed fears about the impact of climate policies on the affordability of energy in the UK. At the Conservative Party conference he told The Times that Britain should not be "in front of the world" on tackling climate change. But the Climate Change Act was designed specifically to make it hard for future politicians to weaken long-term priorities when faced with political difficulty. In order to reduce the UK’s targets, there needs to have been a weakening of the science base or of international action. But the CCC’s report says: “We conclude in this report that, in respect of science, international and EU criteria, there has been no significant change in the circumstances upon which the budget was set. In this regard, there is therefore no legal or economic basis to support a change in the fourth carbon budget. A Treasury spokesman said: "We want to tackle climate change, but it should be done in a way that doesn't put huge costs on people's energy bills or destroys manufacturing jobs. The shale gas revolution in America shows you can reduce carbon emissions, bring bills down and create jobs." The committee thinks the UK is most unlikely to experience a US-style shale gas boom. The committee is concerned at the political backlash against green energy, which it believes has been fuelled by newspaper campaigns. It says renewable energy subsidies are likely to bring down energy bills in the medium term if gas prices continue to rise as many analysts forecast. Doug Parr from Greenpeace said: "The CCC reminds us that tackling climate change is as urgent as ever, but the Treasury persists with its scientifically illiterate campaign to unravel domestic climate policy. The Lib Dems must not allow a watered down fourth carbon budget." Rhian Kelly, the CBI's director for business environment, said: "It seems sensible to maintain the fourth carbon budget at this point in time. However, as the CCC suggests, it would be prudent for the Government to look again at the UK's emissions reduction pathway once EU discussions have concluded, to make sure we remain aligned." Jonathan Grant from consultant PwC said: "The Committee is right to highlight the danger of changing tack or rolling back regulations, as it could undermine business and investor confidence that long term government policy will deliver what is needed to tackle climate change. "In the short term, UK energy emissions increased 2.6% last year, much higher than GDP growth, because of an increased use of coal in power generation. The cost of wholesale transformation of energy generation and other green measures highlights the challenge that politicians are facing everywhere on climate change." Follow Roger on Twitter </body>

      <title>Warming gases reach record high</title>
      <description>New data from the World Meteorological Organization says that atmospheric levels of CO2 and methane have broken new records.</description>

      <body>The levels of gases in the atmosphere that drive global warming increased to a record high in 2012. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), atmospheric CO2 grew more rapidly last year than its average rise over the past decade. Concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide also broke previous records Thanks to carbon dioxide and these other gases, the WMO says the warming effect on our climate has increased by almost a third since 1990. The WMO's annual greenhouse gas bulletin measures concentrations in the atmosphere, not emissions on the ground. Carbon dioxide is the most important of the gases that they track, but only about half of the CO2 that's emitted by human activities remains in the atmosphere, with the rest being absorbed by the plants, trees, the land and the oceans. Since 1750, global average levels of CO2 in the atmosphere have increased to 141% of the pre-industrial concentration of 278 parts per million (ppm). According to the WMO there were 393.1ppm of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in 2012, an increase of 2.2ppm over 2011. This was above the yearly average of 2.02ppm over the past decade. "The observations highlight yet again how heat-trapping gases from human activities have upset the natural balance of our atmosphere and are a major contribution to climate change," said WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud. "It is a worry. The more we delay action the bigger the risk we cannot stay under the 2 degree Celsius limit that countries have agreed," he said. While the daily measurement of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere exceeded the symbolic 400ppm mark in May this year, according to the WMO the global annual average CO2 concentration will cross this point in 2015 or 2016. Levels of methane also reached record highs in 2012 of 1,819 parts per billion. Concentrations have been increasing since 2007 after a period when they appeared to be levelling off. The WMO report says that it is not yet possible to attribute the methane increase to either human activities like cattle breeding and landfills or natural sources such as wetlands. They believe that the rising emissions come from the tropical and mid-latitude northern hemisphere and not from the Arctic, where methane from the melting of permafrost and hydrates has long been a concern. Emissions of nitrous oxide have also grown, with the atmospheric concentration in 2012 at 325.1 parts per billion, 120% above pre-industrial levels. Nitrous oxide gas, although its concentrations are tiny compared to CO2, is 298 times more warming and also plays a role in the destruction of the ozone layer. Recent research indicates that the rate of increase in emissions might be slowing down, but the gases can continue to concentrate in the atmosphere and exert a climate influence for hundreds if not thousands of years. Scientists believe that the new data indicates that global warming will be back with a vengeance, after a slowdown in the rate of temperature increases over the past 14 years. "The laws of physics and chemistry are not negotiable," said Michel Jarraud. "Greenhouse gases are what they are, the laws of physics show they can only contribute to warming the system, but parts of this heat may go in different places like the oceans for some periods of time," he said. This view was echoed by Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds. "For the past decade or so the oceans have been sucking up this extra heat, meaning that surface temperatures have only increased slowly. "Don't expect this state of affairs to continue though, the extra heat will eventually come out and bite us, so expect strong warming over the coming decades." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <body>The company building Britain's first nuclear power station in a generation has denied a suggestion that the new plant would use controversial MOX fuel. French state-owned utility EDF said the use of plutonium-based Mixed Oxide fuel was not under consideration for use at the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Under questioning by the Public Accounts Committee, Mark Higson from the Office for Nuclear Development, said MOX could be used. Mr Higson was speaking on 4 November. The OND chief executive told the committee that MOX fuel could be used "in power stations yet to be built. The EPR reactor at Hinkley, for example". MOX is nuclear fuel that contains more than one oxide of fissile material. It often consists of plutonium along with uranium, from either natural, reprocessed or depleted sources. EDF, which wants to use French reactor technology backed by Chinese money at Hinkley, responded quickly to the statement, saying it was not correct and that using MOX was not even a consideration. In a statement, an EDF spokesman said: "We have not used MOX in any of our stations and have no plans to do so in the future in our existing stations or new nuclear stations." Mixed oxide fuel was contrived as a method of getting rid of Britain's stockpile of civil plutonium - the largest in the world - accumulated from years of reprocessing foreign and UK nuclear waste. But there is no active plan to dispose of the material, which is now seen as a terrorism target and a proliferation risk because it can be used to make nuclear bombs. Turning plutonium into MOX fuel was thought to be the answer. But the Sellafied MOX plant built to make it failed dramatically at a cost of £1.4bn and was closed in 2011. A planned new MOX facility has a price tag of between £5bn and £6bn to the taxpayer. But the business case is controversial. To the astonishment of MPs on the committee, Mr Higson explained: "The value of the fuel, we would expect to be less than the cost of operating and building the MOX plant." In other words, it would be done purely to dispose of the plutonium, with no certain market for the fuel. EDF says it won't use MOX and Horizon, the other major nuclear company hoping to build reactors in the UK, which is backed by the Japanese firm Hitachi, said it has no plans to use MOX either. Steve Thomas, professor of energy policy at Greenwich University, commented: "MOX is a nuclear fuel invented by governments to address the embarrassing problem of what to do with separated plutonium. It is expensive, difficult to handle and increases maintenance and storage costs, so utilities will always be very reluctant to use MOX unless forced to do so." A spokesman for Decc said the government's preferred option for dealing with plutonium remained MOX, but it appeared to row back on the statement made to MPs. "Mr Higson's reference to Hinkley was merely by way of example. The EPR is capable of burning MOX fuel. Actual use of MOX in Hinkley or any other new build reactors would need to be subject to commercial negotiations with operators concerned. Such commercial negotiations are naturally some way off as the reactors have yet to be built." The spokesman added that the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority was also looking at alternative options. Hinkley is already controversial. Peter Atherton of the city firm Liberum Capital called it "the most expensive power station in the world (excluding hydro schemes)". Criticism has focused on the government decision to allow EDF to charge £92.50 per Megawatt-hour (MWh), twice the current market rate for the electricity which, because it is index linked, would be nearer £121 per MWh by the time the plant opens. That could earn the French and Chinese state-owned firms up to £80bn over the life of the plant. A controversy over MOX fuel could be the last thing they need. </body>

      <title>Farming key to closing emissions gap</title>
      <description>A new study suggests that simple changes to agriculture could play a significant role in plans to cut global greenhouse emissions by 2020.</description>

      <body>Changing farming practices could play an important role in averting dangerous climate change says the UN. In their annual emissions report, they measure the difference between the pledges that countries have made to cut warming gases and the targets required to keep temperatures below 2C. On present trends there is likely to be an annual excess of 8 to 12 gigatonnes of these gases by 2020. Agriculture, they say, could make a significant difference to the gap. This is the fourth such report, compiled by the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) in conjunction with 44 scientific groups in 17 countries. It says the world needs to reduce total emissions to 44 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2020 to keep the planet from going above the 2C target, agreed at a UN meeting in Cancun in 2010. But when all the pledges and plans made by countries are added together, they show an excess of between 8 and 12 gigatonnes per annum in seven years time, very similar to last year's report. To put it in context, 12 gigatonnes is about 80% of all the emissions coming from all the power plants in the world right now. The authors highlight a number of ways in which this gap can be closed, including tightening the rules for counting emissions and expanding the scope of pledges already made. They believe around half the gap could be closed in this way. But they say that simple changes in agriculture could cut emissions by four gigatonnes, about two thirds of the remaining difference. Emissions from farming, including nitrous oxide from applying fertiliser and CO2 from ploughing fields accounts for more than 10% of the global total right now. "The potential is enormous," said Dr Joseph Alcamo from the UN Environment Programme. "It's not with anything very exotic, it has to do with the way we apply fertilisers to our fields, it has to do with conservation tillage so you don't plough the fields very rigorously." Conservation tillage includes a number of methods including leaving the previous year's crop residues on the fields to help protect the soils. The UN cited the example of Argentina where 100 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions have been avoided by a shift to conservation tillage that took place in the 1990s. They argue that not only would it curb global warming, it would help poor farmers as well. "You could take a big step down the pathway of sustainable agriculture," said Dr Alcamo, "You can unite ideas of sustainable agriculture for the whole world together with ideas of controlling emissions by 2020." The report highlighted a number of other measures that could bridge the looming gap including energy efficiency, greater emphasis on renewables and reform of fossil fuel subsidies. "A lot of these actions have been done not for climate mitigation but to further national and local interest," said Dr Alcamo. The study makes the point that if action on curbing greenhouse gases isn't taken in the short term, then the possibilities of getting emissions down in the future becomes much more difficult. "Remember 44 gigatonnes by 2020 just sets the stage for further cuts that will be needed," said Unep executive director Achim Steiner. "We need 40 gigatonnes by 2025, 35 gigatonnes by 2030 and 22 gigatonnes by 2050. "At the moment the trend is in the opposite direction, we are over 50 gigatonnes." Next week, delegates from all over the world will gather in Warsaw to continue negotiations on a new global climate agreement that is expected to be signed in 2015. According to Mr Steiner, the emissions gap report shows just how much needs to be done. "This report provides a very sobering perspective of where we are and still heading and quite how far- reaching the implications are of maintaining this trajectory." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <body>Two orphaned otter cubs are being cared for by the Scottish SPCA after being found in distress at Thurso beach in Caithness. The 10-week-old males were spotted by a member of the public. They were scared off by two dogs and were eventually found hiding under a wheelie bin in a nearby garden. Scottish SPCA senior inspector Audrey Gunn managed to trap the pair. They are receiving care at the charity's rescue centre in Clackmannanshire. The cubs, found on 26 October, have been named Thurso and Surf. Ms Gunn said: "Thurso and Surf were timid but curious and I paid a visit to the local fish shop to make sure they were well fed. "They were lucky to be found as otters are dependant on their mothers until they're around a year old and they wouldn't have been able to survive on their own." National Wildlife Rescue Centre manager Colin Seddon added: "Both cubs are well, albeit very frightened. However, they are clearly very happy to be together and they follow each other everywhere." </body>

      <title>Badger cull fails to meet target</title>
      <description>Some 940 badgers were killed in total during a pilot cull, which was lower than the planned target, the government admits.</description>

      <body>One of the badger cull pilot schemes failed to meet its target - even after a three-week extension, the government has admitted. The cull ended last week, with an estimated 65% reduction in the badger population in the west Somerset cull zone - the target was 70%. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said 940 badgers were shot in total. A similar cull in Gloucestershire has been extended until 18 December. Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Owen Paterson said the two badger control pilots were "designed to test that controlled shooting is a safe, humane and effective means of reducing badger numbers". "I am announcing to the House that the three-week extension period in the Somerset control area concluded as planned on Friday 1st November," said Mr Paterson. "During this period, a further 90 badgers have been removed, giving an overall total of 940 for the first year of the four-year cull. "This will deliver clear disease benefits as part of a four-year cull in the area. "While conclusions will need to await the findings of the Independent Panel of Experts, current indications also suggest the pilot has been safe and humane." Ministers and the National Farmers' Union say badger culling is needed to control incidents of TB in cattle. About 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in 2012, at a cost of £100m to taxpayers. However, animal welfare groups say scientific evidence does not support the policy of shooting badgers in an attempt to control the disease. The Wildlife Trusts said the cull was a "complete failure" and should be halted. 'Badgers moved goalposts' "The failure to meet the targets is despite the estimates of the pre-cull badger numbers being twice revised significantly downwards," said Paul Wilkinson, from the charity. "Culling badgers over such a prolonged period and failing to meet the required targets is likely to have worsened the Bovine TB situation at a cost of millions of pounds, whilst putting the local badger populations at significant risk. "The pilot culls have departed completely from their original purpose of testing the method of free shooting, which was abandoned in favour of cage trapping." Shadow environment secretary Maria Eagle mocked Mr Paterson's previous claim that culling targets were missed because "the badgers have moved the goalposts". "By repeatedly moving the goalposts on his own policy, Owen Paterson has risked the further spread of TB due to prolonged disturbance of local badger populations," she said. "David Cameron should stop the unscientific mass culling of badgers now that Owen Paterson's misguided policy has clearly failed." </body>

      <body>A wild boar which has been on the loose in Alderney for more than a month is thought to have swum there from the nearby French coast. The boar found its way into a pig farm on Friday but, when approached, escaped by jumping over a 1m (3ft) stock fence. Farm owner Tess Woodnutt said she would not have believed the animal could jump so high from a standing start, if she had not seen it with her own eyes. Islanders have dubbed the boar "ghost pig", as it has only been seen at dusk. Mrs Woodnutt said she first became aware of the boar on 27 September, when she was on holiday and received a call from a fellow islander saying one of their 40 pigs had escaped. Her son Jake immediately went to the farm and soon established no pigs were missing. Steve Shaw, who was Alderney harbour master for 25 years, said he did not believe it would be possible for a wild boar to get to the island by boat without the crew noticing, and he had never heard of a wild boar being found on any vessel. Some islanders have speculated the animal could be an "iron age pig", which have been farmed on the island. However, Alan Woodnutt, Tess's husband, said he was certain it was not. "Iron age pigs are a cross between a wild boar and a Tamworth," he said. "They look a bit like a wild boar but this animal was not the progeny of an iron age pig." Mrs Woodnutt said the boar's arrival on the island was a mystery but she had had it confirmed to her by an expert in the UK that a wild boar could swim long distances in open water. Wild boar are commonly found in Normandy, the coast of which lies seven miles (11km) to the east of Alderney. Duty Insp Kieran McGrath from Guernsey Police said islanders should contact them if they spotted the animal and should not approach it themselves, as any wild boar could be dangerous when cornered. </body>

His latest documentary, Once Upon a Forest, which is released in Europe on 13 November, is based on an original idea by the French botanist Francis Halle. Prof Halle explained that he had been "looking for a filmmaker for 25 years" in order to tell the story of how a primary forest is born. He added that he wanted to tell this story before the last primary forests on Earth disappear. BBC News met with Prof Halle and Mr Jacquet at the Blue Ocean Film Festival in Monaco and asked them how a botanist's passion became a feature film.

      <body>By BBC camerawoman Rachel Price I have been a camerawoman for 10 years, but the chance to film a rocket going into space was a once in a lifetime opportunity. After a 22-hour journey to Baikonur in Kazakhstan, we had a 4am start. We were escorted into the cosmodrome, a collection of scruffy, space buildings in the desert. Then the hangar door opened, revealing the huge, red booster rockets looming in dark. The sun started to rise, and it was like a curtain had lifted, showing the incredible vast landscape of the desert steppe with the Space rocket crawling through it. Launch Day: We filmed the astronauts as they emerged in their spacesuits in the dark, holding the Olympic torch. They climbed onto the same bus that Yuri Gagarin used on the day he became the first man to launch into space. One minute to go Correspondent Daniel Sandford stepped in front of the main camera and we had one last rehearsal. This "piece to camera" had to be a "one-take wonder" with perfect timing. Blast off. I saw a huge amount of smoke and flames, but there was no sound. We were 1 km away. The rocket started to move. Boom! The sound had finally reached us, and Daniel started talking. I zoomed out to bring him into the picture. The rocket was moving fast out of shot so I panned up off Daniel, chasing the flaming rocket up into the blue sky. A perfect take. That was what we came for. In less than a minute, the rocket was just a burning speck. The torch, strapped inside the capsule on top of the rocket was heading out of the atmosphere. </body>

Rather than a red river of molten rock oozing down a mountainside, this lava is a thick, rubble-strewn mass of rock. Dr Hugh Tuffen, from the University of Lancaster, and his colleagues took the first measurements of this lava flow. They found that it kept moving more than a year after the eruption.

      <description>Satellite's final moments captured on camera from Falklands</description>

      <body>The final moments of the Goce satellite were caught on camera as it blazed across the sky above the South Atlantic. Falkland Islander Bill Chater managed to record the scene as he returned from a day's outing to see penguins. “We saw what we first thought was a shooting star,” Bill told me. “It soon became obvious it was the satellite we had heard about on BBC Radio News an hour before. “It left a long trail of smoke which was bright white in the dark sky, presumably lit by the Sun which we could no longer see.” Goce's fall to Earth on Sunday night made it the first European Space Agency (Esa) mission to make an uncontrolled re-entry into the atmosphere in more than 25 years. Esa has looked at the pictures acquired on East Falkland and says they represent - "in all likelihood" - the destructive end of its one-tonne probe. Dubbed the "Ferrari of space" because of its sleek Italian design, Goce had spent the past four years making precise maps of Earth's gravity. Its plunge through the atmosphere on Sunday became inevitable once the electric engine it had employed to stay in orbit ran out of fuel. Tracking systems were deployed to monitor the rapid descent, with a final estimate for the location of the re-entry put close to the tip of South America, just east of Tierra Del Fuego. American military data timed this event to have occurred at 00:16 GMT, or 21:16 local Falkland time - just as Bill, his wife Vicky, and dad, Tony Chater, were making their way home after spending the day with King Penguins. “We were returning home from Volunteer Point,” says Bill. “It was just getting dark following a long, spectacular sunset and as we came over Wall Mountain, heading south, we saw what we first thought was a shooting star. “It was leaving a thick white trail of smoke and split into a couple of bits, before again breaking up into several smaller parts which all flew over our heads and disappeared northwards over Wall Mountain behind us.” The description of the event fits, as does the location and timing. The direction of the fireballs – moving south to north – also matches what would have been Goce’s death trajectory. Bill says he has video of the event but cannot share it because of the islands’ slow internet connection. Goce started its descent from an operational altitude of 224km, and took a total of three weeks to fall to Earth. The thermal and mechanical stresses that ultimately tore the satellite apart would have begun to take hold while it was still 80km from the Earth's surface. Experts had suggested some 200-250kg could have survived all the way down. If they did, these twisted and charred materials are now at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. It was a violent end for one of the most delicate and sensitive space instruments ever built. Goce’s data lives on, however. Its exquisite maps of the subtle variations in gravity across the surface of the Earth will influence a diverse array of disciplines - from ocean and climate research to geology and civil engineering. </body>

Voice biometrics - the recording and analysis of unique voiceprints for authentication purposes - is one of the latest technological weapons being deployed in the war against fraudsters, thought to be pilfering at least £52bn from the UK economy each year, according to the National Fraud Authority (NFA). UK financial services companies alone are conservatively estimated to be losing more than £5bn annually, the NFA says. But the real figures are likely to be two or three times higher than this as so much fraud goes unreported. Identity theft and account takeover are a big and growing problem, particularly in a digital era that has been a boon to fraudsters by presenting them with many more ways to harvest personal data. The main advantage of voice is that it is much harder to spoof and steal. "Voice is a dynamic form of biometrics, rather than static like a fingerprint, so it is harder to replicate and copy digitally," says Emmanuelle Filsjean, global head of marketing for ValidSoft, which advises retail banks on security and helps European governments tackle cross-border benefit fraud. Digital voiceprints contain over 100 identifiable elements. And, by using complex mathematical algorithms and the latest high-definition audio equipment, voice biometric companies believe they can now identify people accurately more than 97% of the time. Even identical twins, who share the same DNA, can be told apart from their voiceprints, making the technology reliable enough to be used as evidence in courts of law. Voice is crucial because call centres are still the main way we interact with companies, despite the rise of online banking and shopping. Traditional authentication measures, involving personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords, and "memorable" answers to stock questions, have proved fallible, largely because we are fallible - we keep forgetting them. This is why we choose ludicrously simple PINs and passwords that are easy for us to remember - and therefore for others to guess. Fraud investigators have found that about 10% of four-digit PINs stolen by fraudsters are simply 1-2-3-4, while banks report legitimate customers failing call centre authentication procedures 10% to 20% of the time because they cannot remember their security details. "You can't forget your voice," says Prof Levent Arslan, chief executive of Sestek, a technology company that helped Turkish mobile phone company Avea register one million voiceprints in a year. Your voice is also easy to use. "Using our voice is the most intuitive way of interacting," says Ms Filsjean. While no biometrics security system is totally foolproof, fraudsters using high-definition recordings of someone's telephone pass phrase should still be caught out, voice biometrics companies maintain, because even the highest-quality recordings use some form of compression that blunts the highest and lowest frequencies. Even a slight mismatch with the customer's voiceprint will trigger a "live test" conversation that is almost impossible for fraudsters to spoof, particularly if they've only got a recording to use. Barclays' private banking arm, Barclays Wealth, claims great success after implementing voice biometrics. Before introducing the technology, it found that 25% of fraudulent phone calls to its agents were able to bypass the bank's security systems. Fraudsters using "social engineering" techniques - or blagging in the vernacular - were able to elicit security details from agents. The bank would not disclose how much money was being lost as a result. Barclays says that now the number of successful fraudulent calls is zero, because it uses technology from the company behind Apple iPhone's Siri speech recognition system, Nuance, a leader in the field. The voiceprints of suspected fraudsters are kept on a watchlist so they can be identified if they try again pretending to be someone else. Slovakian Tatra Bank is currently rolling out a voice biometric system that will authenticate customer identities while they are speaking to call centre agents. About 10 to 15 seconds of natural conversation is enough to match the voiceprint with the one the bank has on record. Turkish mobile phone operator, Turkcell, now has about 10 million customer voiceprints on its database. "Most financial institutions and big service providers around the world are actively considering adopting voice biometrics," says Almog Aley-Raz, head of voice biometrics for Nuance. The tricky part is enrolling customers in the scheme, as different jurisdictions have their own privacy laws governing voice recording. "In many cases there is ambiguity around the collection and use of biometrics," says Mr Aley-Raz. "But our best practice recommendation to our customers is to obtain consent for using the technology. "Regardless of whether a given jurisdiction has specific provision for the use of biometrics, biometric data is personal, private, and should be treated with the same care as any other data of that type." Voice biometrics alone is not enough to combat fraud, however. Other technologies, such as communications data analytics, must come into play. 'Profound' All UK financial institutions have had to record phone calls for years, and this has led to gargantuan amounts of data sitting in servers, largely ignored. But now audio and video search software, coupled with sophisticated analytical tools, is making this data mountain much more easily accessible and useful. "The enormously sophisticated technologies that dig into written communication are now being switched to the spoken word," says Richard Newton, co-founder of OP3NVoice, a technology company specialising in searchable audio and video recording. "This has profound implications for fraud detection. Analysis of emotions, stress, sentiment, and meaning is a fast-developing area." What you say, how you say it, when, where and to whom, can all be weighted by algorithms that learn to spot suspicious or anomalous patterns of behaviour. As Glenn Perachio, forensics specialist at accountancy firm Ernst and Young, says: "It's like searching for a hay-coloured needle in a haystack, so you need to adopt techniques, such as machine learning, topic modelling, and geo-spatial mapping, to help narrow down the search for that evidence of malfeasance." Voice biometrics and speech analytics, it seems, are finally striking a true - and productive - note. </body>

      <title>What India's space scientists and street children have in common</title>
      <description>What India's space scientists and street children have in common</description>

      <body>As India launched a mission to Mars this week, I could not help noting some surprising similarities between the ingenuity of the country's space scientists and its street children - many of whom are creative small-scale entrepreneurs. When you see young children darting between lumbering locomotives to snatch up an empty water bottle or raking through the great mountains of reeking refuse for the plastic bags and broken cardboard boxes they gather together to sell for fractions of a penny, there appears to be an unassailable argument that social welfare should be put before any attempt to reach for the stars. But I was to discover that neither the plight of Delhi's street children nor the apparent extravagance of India's otherworldly ambitions were quite what they seemed. The team of Indian scientists designing the delicate instruments made to sniff and probe the Red Planet is based in the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad, Gujarat's main city. I had been expecting the kind of shimmering glass monolith you would associate with a Nasa lab or with the headquarters of one of India's world-beating IT companies. But the cradle of the nation's space research harks back to another, older India. There is a hand painted No Spitting sign in English and Hindi at the gate. Inside, the slightly shabby 1970s blocks are shaded by gracious tropical trees full of squabbling parakeets. Yet the scientists who work here confounded the world when India's 2008 lunar probe confirmed the presence of water on the moon - something every previous mission had missed. "We have had to make a virtue of our limitations," says Professor Jitendra Goswami, the director of the institute and the man behind the discovery. He is proud that, at £50m ($80m), India's Mars mission is the cheapest in history by a considerable margin. The payload is tiny, just 14.5kg (32lbs). "Small enough to take on as cabin baggage", he jokes. "Our instruments may cover a very narrow range," he says, serious now. "But they are looking somewhere no-one else had looked - that is how we found water on the moon." He hopes his mission will help answer a key question - has there ever been life on Mars? - by testing for methane over the entire planet's surface. It will also be looking at how the Martian atmosphere has changed. I came away impressed by how India's space programme uses its tiny resources to do innovative and original science. But in some ways what the street children of Delhi do is even more impressive - they find value in something that is regarded as completely worthless by most people, in the city's rubbish. These are some of the poorest people in what is still a very poor country in the world, yet what strikes you when you meet them is not their desperation and despondency - quite the opposite. Many are energetic and creative entrepreneurs. My guide was Iqbal, a former street child who had been taken into care by a charity called the Salaam Baalak Trust. Iqbal was abused as a child and ran away to live rough in Delhi when he was just 10. To my surprise he says life was not that hard. "Food is no problem," Iqbal explains. "Lots of charities give out free food. I would spend the money I earned collecting rubbish playing video games in the backstreet arcades." In fact, one of the biggest challenges for the Salaam Baalak Trust, and charities like it, is persuading the children to give up life on the streets to go and live in their shelters and homes. "They get addicted to this sort of life," Gagan Singh, one of the Salaam Baalak trustees tells me, with a sigh of resignation. "They start enjoying the freedom." Street life may be exciting but it is dangerous. Street children are prey to gangs and paedophiles, many sniff glue and take other drugs. Which is why, Singh tells me, inspiring role models are so important. In one of the Trust's shelters Iqbal points proudly to a poster with photos of half a dozen former street children brought up by the Trust. "Amit has just finished an electronic engineering course, Sonia is doing fashion designing, and," he says, clearly impressed, "Niaz is working at Domino's Pizza as a team leader." In Ahmedabad, Prof Goswami believes the Mars mission should inspire too. He first became fascinated by space after the launch of Sputnik, the world's first satellite, back in 1957. "Night after night I lay stretched out on the lawn in my parent's garden in Assam, looking up into the heavens to try and catch a glimpse of Sputnik passing," he says. He argues that, if the Mars mission is successful, every Indian child, whether in a village in Assam or on the streets of Delhi, can look up into the night sky and, when they catch a glimpse of the red glimmer of Mars, will know their country has been there. He hopes it will raise the ambitions of the entire nation. You can listen to Justin Rowlatt's interview with Professor Jitendra Goswami via BBC iPlayer.

      <description>One hundred years since death of evolution's co-discoverer</description>

      <body>The 100th anniversary of the death of Alfred Russel Wallace, the "forgotten hero" who co-discovered evolution, is being marked today in London. The first ever statue of the naturalist will be unveiled at the Natural History Museum by Sir David Attenborough. A new wasp genus - Wallaceaphytis - has been named in honour of the man who has been in Darwin's shadow ever since they co-published their theory in 1858. The wasp was discovered in Borneo, where Wallace carried out his research. "It seemed only fitting to name it in his honour, especially as it is the centenary of his death," said Dr Andrew Polaszek of the NHM, one of the expedition team who found the insect last year. They have published their discovery in the Journal of Natural History - the same annals in which Wallace published his famous paper on the origin of species - "the Sarawak Law". Just one millimetre long, the wasp belongs to a group known as parasitoids, which lay their eggs inside other insects or spiders. "Wallaceaphytis is so unusual that one of my volunteers called me over to the microscope saying 'this looks really strange'," Dr Polaszek told the BBC. "Not only is it a new species but also a completely new genus. And we found it in Wallace's old stomping ground." The incredible variety of insects Wallace discovered during his travels in the Malay Archipelago inspired his theory of evolution by natural selection. He described his ideas in an essay which he sent to Charles Darwin - who subsequently sought to co-publish his own independent version of the theory. But while there are many, many monuments to Darwin, there has never been a single one of Wallace - until today. A life-size bronze sculpture by Anthony Smith will be unveiled at the NHM by Sir David Attenborough. "For me, there is no more admirable character in the history of science," said Attenborough of Wallace, in a special BBC audio slideshow charting the explorer's life and legacy. The new statue is the result of a fundraising campaign by the Wallace Memorial Fund, which is holding a special day of talks, Consensus, in London on 16 November. It depicts the moment when Wallace first glimpsed the male of the golden birdwing butterfly (Ornithoptera croesus), on Bacan Island, Indonesia, in 1859. "The beauty and brilliancy of this insect are indescribable," wrote Wallace in his book The Malay Archipelago. "On taking it out of my net and opening the glorious wings, my heart began to beat violently, the blood rushed to my head, and I felt much more like fainting than I have done when in apprehension of immediate death. "I had a headache the rest of the day, so great was the excitement produced by what will appear to most people a very inadequate cause." </body>

      <body>I have been a camerawoman for 10 years, but the chance to film a rocket going into space was a once in a lifetime opportunity. After a 22-hour journey to Baikonur in Kazakhstan, we had a 4am start. We were escorted into the cosmodrome, a collection of scruffy, space buildings in the desert. Then the hangar door opened, revealing the huge, red booster rockets looming in dark. The sun started to rise, and it was like a curtain had lifted, showing the incredible vast landscape of the desert steppe with the Space rocket crawling through it. We filmed the astronauts as they emerged in their spacesuits in the dark, holding the Olympic torch. They climbed onto the same bus that Yuri Gagarin used on the day he became the first man to launch into space. Then, with every cameraman looking for the perfect spot, there was a last dash to the platform overlooking the launch pad. The Soyuz rocket stood glistening in the sunrise. Fifteen minutes before launch, I had two cameras set up. One for the live position and my main camera for our correspondent. One minute to go Daniel Sandford stepped in front of the main camera and we had one last rehearsal. This "piece to camera" had to be a "one-take wonder" with perfect timing. Blast off. I saw a huge amount of smoke and flames, but there was no sound. We were 1 km away. The rocket started to move. Boom! The sound had finally reached us, and Daniel started talking. I zoomed out to bring him into the picture. The rocket was moving fast out of shot so I panned up off Daniel, chasing the flaming rocket up into the blue sky. A perfect take. That was what we came for. In less than a minute, the rocket was just a burning speck. The torch, strapped inside the capsule on top of the rocket was heading out of the atmosphere. </body>

      <title>Culling badgers? Call the 'paras'</title>
      <description>Can badger cull extensions do anything to help tackle TB?</description>

      <body>Fresh from leading his very own dessert campaign, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is now doing his bit for "iconic species". And no, I don't mean badgers. Mr Paterson is visiting Kenya this week where he will announce that British Army paratroopers will provide training for local wildlife rangers in their fight against poaching. "Illegal poaching is having a devastating effect on some of the world's most iconic species and we must work together to tackle it," Mr Paterson said ahead of his visit. But perhaps the training and guidance that the paratroopers will be providing, could also be put to good effect back home? As well as details of Mr Paterson's safari to save endangered species, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) published his latest written ministerial statement on the badger cull taking place in Gloucestershire and West Somerset. You'll recall that in both pilot areas, the culling companies were forced to apply to Natural England for extra time to meet the 70% target stipulated in their licences. In West Somerset the natural born cullers were authorised to kill an extra 165 badgers in the three weeks of added time. They managed to shoot an extra 90. So instead of the 70% needed to reduce the incidence of TB in cattle, the men of the night managed to get to 65%. Perhaps with some of that paratrooper training, they would have hit the target? Or maybe those dastardly poachers could be persuaded to visit West Somerset and Gloucestershire? According to Mr Paterson, the failure to hit the magic number doesn't really matter. For this is but year one of a grand four-year plan. This is not to be confused with those old Soviet five-year plans where the harvests were always abundant, and the workers were always smiling. In his statement, Mr Paterson said the advice from the Chief Veterinary Officer "was that a further increase in the number of badgers culled after the initial six-week period would improve the disease control benefits achieved even further and enable them to accrue earlier. "With the further removal of badgers seen," Mr Paterson went on, "the extension has been successful in meeting this aim." So even if they had shot just one extra badger, would that also improve the disease control benefits? I'm getting a sense that goalposts might once again be in motion. Because just a year ago, when he was explaining to the House of Commons why the badger cull should be postponed, Mr Paterson was at pains to say that getting to this magic number was crucial to the success of the trial. "It would be wrong to go ahead if those on the ground cannot be confident of removing at least 70% of the populations," he said at the time. There's an old adage in boxing, that tactical plans go out the window when you get the first punch on the nose. It would appear that Mr Paterson's hooter has been shipping a few blows.

      <description>The big battle over bullfighting in Colombia</description>

      <body>Colombia's Constitutional Court will decide on Thursday whether to reopen Bogota's famous bullfighting ring. In the lead up to the decision, the issue has been raging on social media. Colombians love social media. Anyone who's anyone in the world of politics, sport or celebrity in Colombia uses Twitter. And bullfighting is one of the hottest issues at the moment, says Camilo Andres Garcia, a journalist, high-profile Twitter user and social media commentator in Bogota, who is opposed to bullfighting. It's the blood when the bull dies that many Colombians find hard to deal with. There has been enough human blood shed during the country's decades-long conflict, he says. Bullfighting is associated with the elite in Colombia - and conjures up images of rich ranch owners and women in hats and fancy dresses. There are many high profile supporters of bullfighters - including a number of Colombian newspapers - but on social media, they appear to be losing the PR battle. There are two rival hashtags doing the rounds on Twitter in Colombia ahead of this court decision, #LasCorridasNOVuelvenABogota - bullfighting won't return to Bogota - and #VuelvenlosTorosaBogota - the bulls are coming back to Bogota. The anti-crowd's voice is far louder though (12,000 tweets on their hashtag, versus fewer than 200 on the pro-side at the time of writing). "It's a very important decision for our family," says Diana Carolina Baquero Hernandez, a journalist and bullfighting radio host. Her family's history is bound up with Bogota's bullfighting ring, Plaza la Santamaria. Her father's uncle was once the manager, and many of her relatives were born and grew up inside the stadium. "Bullfighting is our life, our passion, our tradition," she says. Baquero-Hernandez has set up a Facebook page in support of bullfighting, but it's small-scale, and she admits her side is being drowned out. She says many who criticise bullfighting are ill-informed. "I feel angry sometimes because I feel people don't understand the real meaning of bullfighting. Bullfighting is an art." Reporting by Cordelia Hebblethwaite Have you spotted an interesting trend?

      <description>What a mission to Mars means for India</description>

      <body>India's launch of a small unmanned satellite to Mars is being described as a giant leap for its space programme. Science writer Pallava Bagla writes on what the mission means for India and the world. If all goes well and the satellite orbits the Red Planet, India's space agency will become the fourth in the world after those of the United States, Russia and Europe to undertake a successful Mars mission. India's 1,350kg (2,976lb) robotic satellite which is undertaking the 10-month-long, over 200-million-kilometre journey to Mars is equipped with five instruments. They include a sensor to track methane or marsh gas - a possible sign of life - on Mars, a colour camera for taking pictures, and a thermal imaging spectrometer to map the surface and mineral wealth of the planet. The mission will also analyse the thin Martian atmosphere. After India's successful unmanned Chandrayaan mission to the Moon in 2008 that brought back the first clinching evidence of the presence of water there, the Mars mission, according to K Radhakrishnan, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), is a "natural progression". More than 500 scientists from the Bangalore-based Isro worked round the clock on this $73m (£45m) mission, which was announced by PM Manmohan Singh in August last year. Project chief Subbiah Arunan says he has not taken a vacation in the last 15 months, sleeping at Isro's satellite centre in Bangalore and going home for "about one or two hours every day". So does India's Mars mission mark the beginning of a new Asian space race? India sees the Mars mission as an opportunity to beat its regional rival China in reaching the planet, especially after a Russian mission carrying the first Chinese satellite to Mars failed in November 2011. Japan also failed in a similar effort in 1998. China has beaten India in space in almost every aspect so far: it has rockets that can lift four times more weight than India's, and in 2003, successfully launched its first human space flight which India has not yet embarked on. China launched its maiden mission to the Moon in 2007, ahead of India. So if India's mission succeeds, it will have something to feel proud about. "National pride is important. If the Mars mission succeeds, it will be a big morale booster for India. We are not in a space race," says SK Shivakumar, director of Isro's Bangalore-based satellite centre. The risks can be high in a space race. Since 1960 about 40 missions to Mars have been launched, more than half of which have failed. And no nation - apart from Mars Express, Europe's maiden venture to Mars representing 20 countries - has succeeded in its maiden venture. Though India says its Mars mission is the cheapest inter-planetary mission ever to have been undertaken in half a century of space exploration, some are questioning its scientific purpose. "This is a highly suboptimal mission with limited scientific objectives," says D Raghunandan of Delhi Science Forum, a think tank. Others like economist-activist Jean Dreze have said the mission "seems to be part of the Indian elite's delusional quest for superpower status". Rejecting such talk, a top government official says: "We have heard these arguments since the 1960s, about India being a poor country not needing or affording a space programme. "If we can't dare to dream big it would leave us as hewers of wood and drawers of water! India is today too big to be just living on the fringes of high technology."

French physical chemist Herve This says every foodstuff is made up of a basic chemical mixture - and so it's possible to create nutritious dishes from powders, oils and liquids that contain the building-blocks of food, rather than conventional raw ingredients. He calls the principle Note by Note cuisine and says it is like a painter using primary colours, or a musician composing note by note. The result is food not as we know it, more like being given a chemistry set on your plate.

      <body>A painting by Francis Bacon of his friend and fellow artist Lucian Freud has become the most expensive artwork ever sold at auction after it fetched $142m (£89m, 106m euros) in New York. The triptych, Three Studies of Lucian Freud (1969), is considered one of Bacon's greatest masterpieces. It was sold after six minutes of fierce bidding, Christie's auction house said. The price eclipsed the $119.9m (£74m) paid for Edvard Munch's The Scream last year. At the same auction, Jeff Koons broke the world record for a price paid for a single artwork by a living artist. His sculpture Balloon Dog (Orange) - one of a series of five stainless steel sculptures in varying colours - fetched $58,4m (£36.7m). The previous record for a living artist was set by a Gerhard Richter painting depicting an Italian city square, which sold in May for $37.1 million (£23.3m). It was the first time Three Studies of Lucian Freud had been offered at auction and bidding opened at $80m (£50m, 60m euros). Its presale estimate was $85m (£53m, 64m euros). A telephone bidder won with an offer of $127 million (£80m), which, after commission, means they will pay a total of $142m. The auction house did not disclose the identity of the buyer. Bacon, known for his triptychs, painted Three Studies of Lucian Freud in 1969 at London's Royal College of Art, after his studio was destroyed in a fire. Francis Outred, head of Post-War and Contemporary Art at Christie's Europe, said the work was "a true masterpiece and one of the greatest paintings to come up for auction in a current generation". "It marks Bacon and Freud's relationship, paying tribute to the creative and emotional kinship between the two artists," he added. The pair met in 1945 and became close companions, painting each other on a number of occasions, before their relationship cooled during the 1970s. Exhibited in Bacon's renowned retrospective at the Grand Palais, Paris in 1971-1972, the three panels that form the painting were separated in the mid-1970s. One panel was shown at the Tate in 1985 before the three sections were reassembled. The complete work was displayed in New Haven, Connecticut in 1999. It got its first ever UK public viewing at Christie's in London in October this year. </body>

      <body>Tributes have been paid to Sir John Tavener, a leading British composer of the past 50 years, who has died at 69. Fellow composer John Rutter told BBC Radio 3 that Sir John, known for his spiritual music, "was absolutely touched by genius at every point". In 1992 The Protecting Veil topped the classical charts for several months and in 1997 his Song For Athene was played at the funeral of Princess Diana. He suffered ill health for much of his life, and died at his home in Dorset. "He could bring an audience to a deep silence which is a very rare gift," Rutter added. "He believed that music was for everybody and was a prayer." Sir John made his name with the avant-garde oratorio The Whale, which was released by The Beatles on their Apple label in 1968. He went on to become one of the few contemporary composers to find wide acclaim beyond the classical world. Sir John's other well-known works included his setting of William Blake's poem The Lamb and A New Beginning, which was chosen to see in the new century at the end of 1999 in the Millennium Dome in London. He was nominated for the prestigious Mercury Prize twice - in 1992 and 1997 - and was knighted in 2000. Sir John also won a Grammy in 2002 for best classical contemporary composition for Lamentations and Praises, recorded with San Francisco male choral ensemble Chanticleer. Grammy president Neil Portnow said the musician "strived to create compositions that were noble, magnificent and inspirational". Having started his musical career as a teenage organist at a Presbyterian church in London, he converted to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1977 and once said that "my way towards God has been to write music". James Rushton, managing director of Sir John's publisher Chester Music, described him as "one of the unique and most inspired voices in music of the last 50 years". "His large body of work... is one of the most significant contributions to classical music in our times," he said. "For all of those fortunate enough to have known him, John was a man of strong beliefs, huge personal warmth, loyalty and humour. He will be much missed." Sir John was also known for his imposing 6ft 6in (198 cm) frame and his flowing hair. As well as music, one of his great passions was luxury cars. He had suffered a stroke in 1979, and in 1990 was diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome, a hereditary condition that can cause heart defects. In 2007 he suffered a heart attack that caused him to spend six months in intensive care. He defied doctors who did not expect him to return to work, and in his last months described composing as a welcome distraction from constant pain. Sir John was heard on BBC Radio 4's Start the Week on Monday in an interview recorded on 31 October. He recounted how his heart attack had left him unable to "sense the idea of God any more, [and] I couldn't sense any music". He added: "It was only after being nursed by my wife back into some state of health that the music and a different kind of faith started to come back." Sir John premiered three works at the Manchester International Festival this summer, The premiere of his latest work, Three Shakespeare Sonnets, is scheduled to take place at Southwark Cathedral on Friday. Others paying tribute included cellist and collaborator Steven Isserlis, who remembered the composer as "full of humour, very funny". "He's unique," Isserlis told Radio 3. "Classical music has fractured into all these completely different languages and voices and he had his own voice. He wasn't writing to be popular - he was writing the music he had to write." Gill Graham, his publisher of 11 years, said he was a "true inspiration" to her. "He was a gentle, funny, kind, strong-willed and beautiful man. I will miss him terribly," she added. Composer and conductor Sir Peter Maxwell Davies said Sir John's contribution to spiritual music was "immense", adding his death "is a great loss to the world of spiritual music". Soprano Patricia Rozario said: "He really connected with our humanity, and people from all walks of life and different areas. "Once he told me there were a whole group of youngsters who listened to his music while at a rave party, and he was quite touched by that, that even young people connected with his music." Radio 3 controller Roger Wright described Sir John as "of one of our most powerful and individual voices". A Clarence House spokesman said: "The Prince of Wales was saddened to hear of the death of John Tavener." He was widely reported to be Prince Charles's favourite composer. </body>

      <body>Strictly Come Dancing contestant Natalie Gumede has confirmed she will be dancing in Blackpool this Saturday. "Thrilled to say I've been declared fit to dance this Saturday! Bring on Blackpool!" she tweeted. "I have rested well and I'm feeling fantastic." The former Coronation Street star did not perform last weekend following a fainting episode during rehearsals. Gumede, who was checked by the Strictly medical team on site before being taken to hospital, was ordered to rest. According to the rules of the contest, the actress was allowed to continue into this weekend's show on the condition that she was medically fit to do so. Writing on Twitter, the soap star denied she was suffering "from panic attacks or anxiety", as some reports have suggested. She put her collapse down to "just exhaustion after a long few weeks following an epidural". "Feeling great and grateful for your support," she added. A favourite to win the show, Gumede has frequently topped the leader board with her dance partner Artem Chigvintsev. In their last performance on 2 November, the pair finished four points ahead of their nearest rivals. Last month Gumede missed rehearsals for the 19 October show because of an injury. She had an MRI scan to see if she had slipped a disc in her back, but was later given the all-clear. As a child, Gumede reportedly trained as a dancer but was forced to give up because of injury. </body>

      <body>A portrait of jockey Katie Walsh has been awarded the 2013 Taylor Wessing Photographic Prize at a London gala. Spencer Murphy took the shot of jump jockey Walsh at Kempton Park, although she had not raced there that day. He wins a cheque for £12,000. Last year the Kent photographer took third place with his portrait of stage actor Mark Rylance. His work will go on show at the National Portrait Gallery in London from 14 November to 9 February. The exhibition showcases the best in contemporary portrait photography. The other three finalists will also be displayed at the exhibition - Giles Price's shot from the Kumbh Mela Festival in India, which was awarded second place, Anoush Abrar's photograph of former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, which came third, and Dorothee Deiss's portrayal of twin sisters, which finished fourth. The judges selected 60 portraits for the show from 5,410 submissions. Murphy, whose work has been included in the exhibition on six previous occasions, said: "I was keen to include Katie. I wanted to show both her femininity and the toughness of spirit she requires to compete against the best riders in one of the most demanding disciplines in horse racing. "I chose to shoot the series on large-format film, to give the images a depth and timelessness that I think would have been hard to achieve on a digital camera," he added. The John Kobal New Work Award for a photographer under the age of 30 was given to Hana Knizova, selected for the exhibition for her portrait of twin sisters Elza and Nellie. She wins a commission to photograph a sitter connected with the UK film industry for the National Portrait Gallery Collection. Sandy Nairne, director of the National Portrait Gallery in London, said: 'The 2013 Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait Prize exemplifies photographic portraiture at its most perceptive. These are sharp, engaging portraits. My congratulations to all the prizewinners." </body>

      <description>Presenter Alan Titchmarsh steps down from the BBC's Chelsea Flower Show coverage after 30 years as host.</description>

      <body>Presenter Alan Titchmarsh is stepping down from the BBC's Chelsea Flower Show coverage, after 30 years as its host. He will not feature in BBC One and Two's broadcasts from the event, which will undergo a revamp for 2014. BBC newsreader Sophie Raworth will join the new-look presenting team, along with Gardeners' World host Monty Don. The horticultural show had been Titchmarsh's last major BBC commitment, after many years fronting Gardeners' World from his own garden. He quit the BBC Two show in 2002 and currently hosts an afternoon chat show on ITV and, following his departure from Radio 2, hosts a radio series on Classic FM. "The way the Chelsea coverage will be presented across the BBC has changed for 2014, and Alan decided to step away from next year's show," said a BBC spokeswoman. Titchmarsh, 64, said: "I really enjoyed my 30 years of presenting Chelsea Flower Show coverage for the BBC and wish the new team every success." Raworth and Don will join Chelsea Flower Show regulars such as Joe Swift for more than 12 hours of broadcasts from the show ground in London. They will include live coverage of the latest designs and planting innovations. Raworth, who unlike the majority of the show's presenters is not a gardening expert, said she was "delighted and honoured" to be part of the team. "I grew up in a family of very keen gardeners, so know something about the joys and sheer hard work that go into creating such beautiful places," she said. Other returning faces for the 101st Chelsea show include Carol Klein and Rachel de Thame from Gardener's World and Andy Sturgeon, Chris Beardshaw and Toby Buckland. </body>

      <title>Catching Fire 'had minor cuts'</title>
      <description>The director of the latest Hunger Games film says he "cut a couple frames" to secure a PG-13 rating in the US.</description>

      <body>The director of the latest Hunger Games film has said he had to make some very minor changes to secure a PG-13 rating in the US. "We didn't have too many issues with the ratings board," Francis Lawrence told the BBC. "We had to go back and we cut a couple frames, adjusted some volume, took a little bit of blood out, but it was very little that we had to do." The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is out in the UK on 21 November. The film's star, Jennifer Lawrence, and other cast members walked the red carpet on Monday night in London's Leicester Square at the film's world premiere. It is released in the US on 22 November. Catching Fire is the second film of the franchise based on the best-selling trilogy of novels by Suzanne Collins. It is set in a society where adolescents fight to the death on live TV. In this latest instalment, last year's victors Katniss (Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) become targets of the ruling elite after they help spark a rebellion. They are shocked when it is announced that the next Hunger Games will feature victors from previous years. The cast includes Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz, Donald Sutherland and Philip Seymour Hoffman. In the US, the film is rated PG-13 for "intense sequences of violence and action, some frightening images, thematic elements, a suggestive situation and language". "We always aim in America for the PG-13," said Francis Lawrence, who is not related to Jennifer. "You're always aware of those guidelines so whenever you get into a scene or sequence that could be tricky, you try and stay vigilant, you try and shoot some options, have an idea ahead of time so you don't get stuck." He assumed that Gary Ross, director of the first film The Hunger Games, may have had a harder challenge. "It must have been a different ball game because kids killing kids is always really tough no matter how much you show. "Fortunately, I didn't have to deal with that because this time in there's far less human-on-human violence, the arena is more of a threat and the tributes [fighters] are now adults - the youngest that are in there are Katniss and Peeta. That alone makes it a completely different ball game." In the UK, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire has been rated 12A after being passed uncut by censors. The BBFC report said the film contained "moderate violence and threat, and infrequent strong language". Cuts were made to the original Hunger Games film in 2012 in order to avoid a 15 rating in UK cinemas, which would have potentially decreased box office takings. The first instalment of the franchise made £27.2m at the UK box office, and nearly $700 million (£441m) worldwide. Most early reviews of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire have been glowing. The Telegraph's Robbie Collins observed: "Set against many intellectually bloodless teenage fantasies, this is as juicy as a cut of sirloin... Is it too soon to say I can't wait for the next one?" The Hollywood Reporter's Todd McCarthy called it "a safe, serviceable, carefully crafted action drama". He went on: "As before, Jennifer Lawrence is the superb centre of it all and the massive success of this Lionsgate release is as certain as the turning of the Earth." In a three-star review, The Guardian's Paul MacInnes said: "There's never quite the sense of satisfaction that the first film provided. You can feel the franchise dynamic chugging beneath, with the result that Catching Fire is not quite a full course, more of an amuse bouche, making its mammoth audience hungry for future, meatier instalments." </body>

      <title>BBC viewers to have say on channels</title>
      <description>TV audiences are invited to get in touch with their views about BBC One, Two, Three and Four as the BBC Trust announces its largest review into the channels.</description>

      <body>TV audiences have been invited to air their views on BBC One, Two, Three and Four as the BBC Trust announces its largest review into the channels. The Trust's "most ambitious" review will combine all four BBC channels for the first time, including a three-month public consultation. As the BBC's governing body, the Trust's role is to ensure licence fee payers get the best value for money. Public consultation will close in February 2014. The Trust will also carry out audience research over the following months. Due in summer 2014, the review will assess whether each channel fulfils its licence agreement, which sets out what the public can expect of each BBC service. The review will also look at what the channels' future direction should be. The Trust will answer whether the channels are delivering quality content across a range of genres, and how each demographic is being catered for. "The licence fee places a great obligation on the BBC to be bolder than other broadcasters in delivering ambitious and distinctive programmes for its audiences," said BBC Trustee David Liddiment. The review will also explore how each channel is responding to changes in audience expectations and the way they view programmes, in response to new technology. "In this fully digital age the television landscape is changing dramatically and BBC television can be viewed anytime, anywhere, on pretty much any device and our viewers have never been more discerning," said BBC Trustee Suzanna Taverne. "We want to make sure the BBC is delivering the highest quality content to all audiences; however they choose to access it," she added. "We'd encourage those who watch BBC television to get in touch through our consultation to tell us how they think these four channels are doing." This is the Trust's second review of BBC Television but the first to look at these four channels together. BBC One, Two and Four were reviewed in 2010 and BBC Three in 2009 as part of the Trust's review into younger audiences. A separate review of BBC network news and current affairs was launched in September 2013, so it will not be considered in this review. Meanwhile Home Secretary Theresa May has warned that the "might of the BBC" and its online news operation is undermining local newspapers. "If the BBC can provide all the locally-significant news, what reason is left for local people to buy a newspaper?" said the Conservative MP, during a speech at the Society of Editors conference in London on Monday. "That's as dangerous for local politics as it is for local journalism," reported the Guardian and Telegraph newspapers. "There is a real need for the BBC to think about its own position and what it is doing and the impact it has," said May. </body>

      <description>Lucasfilm amends open audition venues and dates for the lead roles in the next Star Wars film after large numbers of hopefuls came to the first casting call in Bristol.</description>

      <body>Details of open auditions for lead parts in the next Star Wars film have been altered following the success of the first talent search in Bristol. Glasgow auditions have been postponed until 30 November, while new venues for other existing dates will be announced. London, Dublin and Manchester are the other cities where producers will seek a young man and woman to play the roles in director JJ Abrams' movie. Some 2,500 hopefuls turned up to the casting event in Bristol. Many had to be turned away after queuing for hours in the rain. Producers are also allowing hopefuls, unable to make an audition, to submit a video application for the parts of a "street smart" girl in her late teens and a "smart, capable" man in his early 20s by 3 December. The roles have been named "Rachel" and "Tom" in a likely effort to disguise the real names of the Star Wars characters. The latest details and schedule of the UK open auditions are on Twitter account @ukopencall. Open casting calls are also taking place in the US. Abrams, who is also co-scripting the movie, is not due to attend the open auditions. Star Wars: Episode VII is scheduled to begin shooting at Pinewood Studios in spring 2014, for an expected 2015 release. </body>

      <description>Police and art experts check 22 artworks found in southwest Germany as 25 of the Munich treasures are named on the web.</description>

      <body>Police and art experts are checking 22 artworks found in southwest Germany which may be linked to the huge hoard of art treasures seized in Munich. The regional broadcaster SWR says most of the 22 works are valuable paintings. Some may have been looted by the Nazis. On Saturday Paris Match magazine published a photo of a man alleged to be Cornelius Gurlitt, the Munich collector. He was spotted in Munich. So far 25 of the Munich works have been listed on the website www.lostart.de. On Saturday police in Baden-Wuerttemberg removed 22 artworks from a flat in Kornwestheim, a town near Stuttgart. They are now being examined at a secret location. The flat belongs to an 80-year-old man, who is a brother-in-law of Cornelius Gurlitt and, like him, a former art collector. Four of the paintings are believed to have been acquired from Mr Gurlitt, SWR says. Stuttgart police said the 80-year-old was not suspected of any crime and had himself contacted the police to get his collection stored in a safe place. The intense media interest in the Gurlitt case had made him anxious, SWR reported. More than 1,400 artworks were found at the Munich flat of Mr Gurlitt in March 2012. The total value has been estimated at about 1bn euros (£846m; $1.35bn). German authorities showed images of some of the works, by famous artists such as Marc Chagall, Otto Dix, Max Liebermann and Henri Matisse. But they have not yet published a full list and the officials stressed that a painstaking investigation is now under way. Some of the Munich works may have been stolen from Jews and kept in Nazi collections during 1933-1945. </body>

      <body>The director of Brad Pitt's latest movie has apologised for filming war scenes featuring extras in Nazi uniforms on Remembrance Sunday. David Ayer, the director of Fury, expressed his "heartfelt apologies for any disrespect caused". Pre-dawn explosions and scenes using extras dressed in Nazi uniform were filmed in an Oxfordshire village. Parish council chairman Ian Hill earlier said that "local people were very angry" with the decision to film. According to a report in the Daily Mirror, the film's makers rejected a plea to suspend their operations. Producers Sony also issued an apology, stating that they "deeply regret any misunderstandings caused". An extra who was filming on Sunday told the Mirror: "This was grotesquely disrespectful and offensive. I can't believe I wore an SS uniform on Remembrance Sunday." Nearby residents were told to expect gunfire and explosions throughout the making of the film, which is expected to take place in the area until 15 November. Ayer added in his message on Twitter: "I am a veteran myself. It is an honour to film here in the UK," and posted a picture of a Veterans' Day ceremony at Arlington Cemetery in the US. He has also been regularly posting photographs from the set of his World War 2 tank battle movie, including one dated Sunday, 10 November. Fury, which also stars Jason Isaacs and Shia LaBeouf, is due to be released in October next year. Ayer's other credits include writing the screenplay for 2001 film The Fast and the Furious, while he directed Sabotage starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, which is expected to come out next April. Shadow defence minister Kevan Jones said: "I'm astonished producers would not consider it to be inappropriate to film such scenes on Remembrance Sunday. "It is outrageous appeals from locals to reconsider plans to film on such an occasion were ignored." </body>

      <title>Squeezed museums ‘feeling the heat’</title>
      <description>There is a growing gulf between museums in London and elsewhere in the UK that has left some venues struggling to host exhibitions and facing closure, the Museums Association president says.</description>

      <body>There is a growing gulf between museums in London and elsewhere in the UK that has left some venues struggling to host exhibitions and facing closure, the Museums Association president has said. "We're beginning to go into a different world where the temperature's going right up," David Anderson warned. "Museums are beginning to close sites, they're beginning to reduce staffing." Speaking at the association's annual conference, he said the risk of closures would get "a lot worse". A Museums Association survey last month found that 23% of venues had seen their incomes drop by 10% in the previous year, while 21% said they had cut at least one in 10 staff. Local councils in England cut their funding to museums by an average of 11% in 2011-12, according to figures from the association. "That's a dramatic drop," said Mr Anderson, who is director of National Museum Wales He pointed to an unnamed but "reasonably large-sized regional museum" which had to turn down a free visiting exhibition from a national venue because it had cut staff and could not afford to install it. "That's the canary in the mine, that one," he said. "There are things happening now that we've not seen before, in this generation anyway." His comments follow a recent report that showed that cultural venues in London receive £69 of central government funding per resident, compared with £4.60 per head in the rest of England. Mr Anderson called on the funding to be made fairer but admitted that museums could do more to persuade politicians why they are "so critically important". Asked what would happen if the current trend continued, he replied: "We are going to end up very probably with a large focus on a few metropolitan areas and a tiny distribution of resource elsewhere. "Rather like the financial sector has sucked resource into London and exists in a world of its own, we're going to find that the arts world is in the process currently of sucking resource out of the nations and regions and into London, and a few other centres like Edinburgh, which are fairly wealthy as well. "You'll have a great separation. The wealthy institutions will get wealthier and the poor institutions will get poorer. That's exactly what will happen for the next two decades. It's slowly been happening - now it's gathering speed." Venues currently under threat include the Walsall Museum and the Whithorn Trust, which looks after historical sites in south-west Scotland, while the Science Museums Group recently rescinded a threat to close one of its attractions in either Bradford, Manchester or York. Meanwhile, new shadow culture minister Helen Goodman told delegates she was "really appalled" at the report on the difference between arts and culture funding in London and the rest of England. She also said any Labour government would not increase arts funding in the first year after taking office. "You will all readily accept that my colleagues who deal with the bedroom tax, disability, care for the elderly, to name but three, are ahead of me in the queue to [shadow chancellor] Ed Balls' door," she said. "So I cannot promise you new money in year one. Hard choices will still be needed. But I think we must and can look after and use the assets we do have much better." The Museums Association used the conference in Liverpool to announce that it had expelled Croydon Council for planning to sell 24 valuable Chinese ceramics. The council hopes the sale will raise money towards redeveloping Fairfield Halls, a 50-year-old concert hall, theatre and gallery. But selling items from a museum's collection is against the association's rules in most cases. </body>

      <body>Levels of gun violence have more than tripled since 1985 in films rated as suitable for teenagers, according to a US study. Gun violence in PG-13 films last year actually exceeded that in films rated R for viewers aged 17 and older, according to the research. Overall film violence had doubled since 1950, found the study published in the American Academy of Pediatrics. Put simply, violence "sells", one researcher told the BBC. Dr Daniel Romer, co-author of Gun Violence Trends in Movies, said he and his colleagues had examined the top 30 grossing movies of each year from 2012 to 1950. In a total of 945 films from the last six decades, there were 17,695 violent scenes, according to the joint study by Ohio State University and the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. Some 396 of the 420 films they studied since 1985 contained violence, including 783 instances of gun violence. Some of the recent PG-13 movies that "had a lot of gun violence", according to the study, included The Dark Knight (2008), Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011), Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), The Avengers (2012), The Amazing Spiderman (2012) and Taken 2 (2012). The study's authors suggested that sex scenes were more likely to incur a stricter rating than scenes of violence. Dr Romer suggested the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) re-evaluate its rating system in order to better protect young viewers in the future. "We'd like to see those films [containing gun violence] put into the R category… or [have them] rethink how much gun violence they will show," Dr Romer said. Viewership of R-rated films is restricted to those over age 17 or accompanied by a parent; PG-13 strongly cautions parents that some material may not be appropriate for viewers under age 13. But that rating does not preclude theatres from selling tickets to anyone of any age. </body>

      <body>The stars of a new stage adaptation of Jeeves and Wooster have said the popularity of dramas like Downton Abbey could boost the new show's box office. Stephen Mangan and Ripper Street's Matthew MacFadyen respectively play the hapless toff and his faithful valet. Mangan said: "It's almost a fantasy, that turn of the century England where people are good eggs." "It's a bit like the Downton vision of England and it was hugely popular in America for that reason." "It's just like Downton because we like to see this prettied up version of England," he said. The new show, Perfect Nonsense, is directed by Sean Foley and is based on PG Wodehouse's 1938 novel The Code of the Woosters. The story sees Bertie Wooster unwittingly called on to play matchmaker - reconciling the affections of Madeline Bassett with his newt-fancying acquaintance Gussie Fink-Nottle. Wodehouse, who died in 1975, aged 93, is undergoing something of a revival. Earlier this year, BBC One broadcast a TV adaptation of his Blandings Castle stories, with another series commissioned for next year. Birdsong author Sebastian Faulks has also written a new book, Jeeves and The Wedding Bells, after being asked by the Wodehouse estate to bring the "immortal" characters to life. "I hope my story will ring bells with aficionados, but also bring new readers to these wonderful books," he added. The characters were memorably played on TV by Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry in the 1990s. Mangan, star of Green Wing and Episodes, holds Wodehouse up as one of the funniest writers of all time, and said his enduring popularity would stand the new show in good stead. "The Wodehouse fan base is already massive and we've had a lot of interest from the moment it was announced that we were doing it because apart from a musical that Lloyd Webber did in the 70s, they've never been played on stage. "But yes, fans of Downton, anyone who likes period drama, will maybe look our way." Jeeves and Wooster opens on 12 November. </body>

      <title>Court overturns Lissadell ruling</title>
      <description>The Irish Supreme Court overturns a High Court judgment that there were public rights of way to Lissadell House estate - a favourite haunt of writer W B Yeats - in the Republic of Ireland.</description>

      <body>The Irish Supreme Court has overturned a High Court judgement that there were public rights of way to Lissadell House estate in the Republic of Ireland. The court found there were no such rights of way, except for a small part of an avenue with access to the coast. Lissadell House was the ancestral home of the Gore-Booths and was made famous in a poem by W B Yeats. The case is one of the longest and most expensive property disputes in the history of the Irish state. It involved the house owners and Sligo County Council over right-of-way access. The 19th-century mansion Lissadell, which sits on 400 acres of land in County Sligo, was bought in 2003 by Edward Walsh and Constance Cassidy for 4.55m euros (£3.8m). They spent millions restoring it before opening it to the public. They argued they could not grant an untrammelled right of way for reasons of security, insurance and maintenance. As a result of the council's decision, the couple closed the estate in 2009 although it was attracting 40,000 visitors a year. They also let 11 staff go. In a statement at the time, they said it had become impossible to operate the house as a historic house or private home. "No property whatsoever, let alone a large tourist facility, could be operated on the basis of unregulated, uncontrolled and unfettered access," they said. Lissadell is one of the Republic of Ireland's most historic premises and was the childhood home of high profile rebel Countess Markiewicz. The house featured in a poem by W B Yeats, for whom it was a favourite haunt. Countess Markiewicz fought alongside the Irish insurgents during the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin. She was condemned to death by the British authorities, but her sentence was later quashed and she was imprisoned instead. After refusing to take her seat as the first woman MP at Westminster, she later sat as a member of the first Dail, the Irish parliament. The case has already been the subject of a 58-day high court hearing estimated to cost 6m euros (£5m). The Supreme Court judgment will have serious implications for Sligo County Council, which had argued there was an inferred dedication of public right of way through decades of public use. </body>

      <description>Actor Mark Rylance is upstaged by his own dog as he performs Shakespeare on Broadway for the first time.</description>

      <body>Actor Mark Rylance has made his Broadway Shakespeare debut - but was upstaged by his own dog's performance. Apache, a Jack Russell Terrier, was reluctant to leave the Belasco Theatre stage, where Rylance is starring in Richard III and Twelfth Night. "He made an excellent entrance, but I'll have to teach him a few things about exits!" said Rylance, winner of two Tony awards. The actor plays the medieval monarch and noblewoman Olivia in the two plays. London's Globe Theatre is staging the productions, with Richard III in the afternoon and Twelfth Night in the evening - a total of six hours of theatre. The company, putting on Shakespeare on Broadway for the first time, is following the Tudor tradition of having an all-male cast playing all of the roles, including the female ones. Rylance, who added that his dog was also making his New York theatrical debut, was called "astonishing" in a review by Ben Brantley of the New York Times. "This is how Shakespeare was meant to be done," he added. The two plays and gender-swapping roles allow him to be "as brilliant in trousers as he is in a dress", added the review. Marilyn Stasio, writing in Variety, said that Rylance's portrayal of Richard III was "an assassin consumed less by envy and hatred of his victims than loathing for his own twisted self." Stephen Fry, making his New York stage debut as Malvolio in Twelfth Night, was praised for his sympathetic portrayal of the usually malevolent character. The New York Times said: "Malvolio is refreshingly embodied by Mr. Fry with the complacency and affectation of someone you might recognize from your own office." Brantley said that the two productions were "a source of radiant illumination for the audience, while the bewilderment of the characters onstage floods us with pure, tickling joy. "I can't remember being so ridiculously happy for the entirety of a Shakespeare performance since - let me think - August 2002." He went on to explain this was when he last saw Twelfth Night at the Globe Theatre in London, starring Mark Rylance. Both plays are due to continue at the Belasco Theatre until 30 November. </body>

      <body>Marvel superhero blockbuster Thor: The Dark World pounded its rivals at the North American box office, taking $86.1m (£53.8m) in its opening weekend. The sequel to the 2011 movie sees Chris Hemsworth reprise his role as the god of thunder who battles to save Earth from evil forces. Bad Grandpa, from the makers of Jackass, held the number two spot for a second week, taking $11.3m (£7.1m). Animated film Free Birds was just behind at three with $11.2m (£7m). The film features the voices of Owen Wilson and Woody Harrelson as a pair of turkeys who try to keep their kind off Thanksgiving dinner plates. Last Vegas, featuring Robert De Niro, Michael Douglas, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline as four friends who reunite for a stag party, fell one place to four. Last week's number one, Ender's Game, tumbled down the chart in its second week to five. Industry forecasts had predicted the second Thor instalment would debut with at least $90m (£56m). It missed that target but did surpass the original film, which opened with $65.7m (£41m). "It's a great start," Dave Hollis, executive vice president of distribution for Walt Disney Studios said, adding Disney would have considered "anything north of $80m (£50m) to be a good result." Including international markets - where the movie has been playing since 30 October - the film has now taken some $327m (£204m) globally. </body>

      <title>Iranian band members shot dead in NY</title>
      <description>Three Iranian-expatriate musicians living in Brooklyn, New York, are shot dead by another Iranian musician in what police called a murder-suicide.</description>

      <body>Four Iranian-expatriate musicians living in Brooklyn, New York, have been shot dead in what authorities are labelling a murder-suicide. Two members of the group Yellow Dogs and a third artist were slain by a fellow musician, Ali Akbar Mahammadi Rafie, who later took his own life. Police believe the attack happened as Rafie, 29, was upset after being thrown out of another band. Two of those killed had just received political asylum in the US. They were brothers and members of the Yellow Dogs, who described themselves on their Twitter feed as "a Post Punk/Dance Punk band from Tehran/Iran, living in Brooklyn at the moment". Gunfire rang out early on Monday as Rafie climbed from the roof on to a third-floor terrace where he opened fire through a window, shooting dead Ali Eskandarian, 35, a musician, said police. Arash Farazmand, 28, the Yellow Dogs drummer, was found dead on the same level of the apartment. His brother, Soroush Farazmand, 27, the band's guitarist, was using his laptop in bed when he received fatal gunshot injuries. The Yellow Dogs' two other members were not at the flat at the time of the killing. According to police, another unidentified tenant was hit in the arm as Rafie and a former fellow band mate from a group called the Free Keys struggled over the gun. Rafie retrieved ammunition that had fallen out of the firearm, went to the roof and shot himself in the head, said police. The person wounded in the arm was taken to hospital and is said to be in stable condition. Rafie "was upset that he wasn't in the band anymore", said New York Police Department spokesman John McCarthy. Investigators believe the gunman and his former Free Keys members, may have had an argument over money, but it was unclear why he shot at members of the Yellow Dogs. The rifle was found next to Rafie's body, according to NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly. He said it had been purchased in New York state in 2006, and police were tracking its history. Police are investigating whether a guitar case found near the scene was used to carry the assault rifle in the attack. The Yellow Dogs were well-known among young Iranian expatriates in the US, reports Bahman Kalbasi of the BBC Persian service. Ali Salehezadeh, the band's manager, said the gunman knew the victims but had not spoken to them in months because of a "petty conflict". "There was a decision not to be around each other," he said. "They were never that close to begin with. We thought it was all behind us." The shooting took place in Brooklyn's East Williamsburg neighbourhood, known for its edgy, creative vibe and community of artists and musicians. The band members had lived in the neighbourhood. "They seem like really nice guys," a local man, Martin Greenman, told the New York Daily News. "They didn't seem to be in any way to be violent guys. They weren't rabble rousers or anything like that." Mr Salehezadeh said the victims' relatives were stunned. "People don't own guns in Iran," he said. "We don't have this problem there. It doesn't exist." Members of an Iranian band with the same name were interviewed by US consulate officials in Istanbul in 2009 as they applied for a visa for a US tour, according to a diplomatic cable leaked to Wikileaks. They described the "small but crazy" underground rock scene in Tehran, saying it was the community that offered "the most free expression" in Iran. </body>

      <body>Singer Geri Halliwell ditched a performance of her comeback song on Australia's Got Talent final after it stalled in the charts. The former Spice Girl, who is a judge on the show, opted to sing a version of the group's debut hit Wannabe. Half of Me sold just 393 copies, leading Halliwell to write on her blog: "I'm not afraid to say - I lost!" She added that her replacement choice of song felt "honest, just like home, for you and I, for all of us." The singer said that when she heard the news of her chart placing, she "laughed nervously, God that's really bad!" and admitted that "deep down" she was "gutted". She went on to explain that performing the song "with gusto" might push it higher in the charts, but it would be better to admit that it hadn't "connected" with the Australian public. The Australian singles chart was topped by X Factor winner Dami, whose song shifted more than 44,000 copies. The performance of Halliwell's comeback is in stark contrast to her earlier solo career, which boasted a string of chart-topping hits in the UK and around the world, including Bag It Up, Mi Chico Latino and a cover of The Weather Girls' It's Raining Men. </body>

      <body>Good Morning America's Amy Robach has revealed she will have a double mastectomy this week, a month after undergoing a mammogram on the show. The 40-year-old correspondent discovered she had breast cancer after reluctantly agreeing to have a screening filmed for the ABC show. She said GMA anchor Robin Roberts had persuaded her that if the story saved one life, it would be worth it. "It never occurred to me that life would be mine," said Robach. Producers chose Robach to cover the mammogram story because it is recommended that women at the age of 40 regularly check for breast cancer. During Monday's programme, and in a blog post following the show, Robach said doctors had not yet determined what stage the cancer had progressed to, or whether it had spread. The original story, which was part of the GMA Goes Pink breast cancer awareness day, featured Robach emerging from her on-air mammogram, before telling colleagues that it hurt much less than she thought it would. A few weeks later she was told she had cancer, after returning for what she thought would be some follow-up images. Robach said that her husband, actor Andrew Shue, had returned from his work trip that night and her parents had also caught a flight to New York to join her. "We started gearing up for a fight," she said, as she revealed that she would have both breasts removed this Thursday, followed by reconstructive surgery. Robach joined ABC in 2012 from NBC, where she was a Weekend Today host. She frequently filled in as a presenter on ABC's top-rated morning show GMA, while host Roberts was fighting a serious blood and bone marrow disease. Robach said that with a full-time job and two children she had always found reasons to put off having a mammogram herself. However a doctor told her that the test had saved her life. "I can only hope my story will inspire every woman who hears it to get a mammogram, to take a self-exam," said Robach. "No excuses. It is the difference between life and death." </body>

      <title>Royal press charter 'bonkers'</title>
      <description>Former BBC chairman Lord Grade tells the Society of Editors the cross-party royal charter on press regulation is "bonkers".</description>

      <body>Former BBC chairman Lord Grade has called the cross-party royal charter on press regulation "bonkers". He said that giving politicians "the opportunity to amend statutory press regulation cannot be in the public interest". But Lord Grade also told the Society of Editors: "We should never forget where this sorry trail began: With journalists behaving badly." "The press, in other words, has brought this situation on itself," he added. In his speech, Lord Grade, who is currently a member of the Press Complaints Commission, said: "It certainly does at times seem as if tabloid journalists leave their humanity and their conscience at home when they head for the newsroom. "You do wonder how some of them sleep at night." The issue of press regulation emerged following the phone-hacking scandal and subsequent Leveson Inquiry into the ethics and practices of newspapers. Lord Grade accused MPs of being "comprehensively hijacked" by the Hacked Off lobby group, which led the campaign for tighter press regulation. Its high-profile supporters included a number of celebrities who were victims of alleged phone hacking, including actors Steve Coogan and Hugh Grant. "So eager were our elected representatives to show just how deeply they shared the public's outrage, that they handed what looked like a veto on [press regulation] to the unelected representatives of Hacked Off as they drafted," Lord Grade said. The new royal charter on press regulation was granted by the Privy Council in October. It will create a watchdog to oversee a new press regulator. Media organisations will be free to sign up or stay outside the new system of regulation. But, Lord Grade argued, news editors "must be accountable publicly" through independent regulation, adding, "they must be prepared not only to argue the public interest in publishing, but also to defend the ethics of their news gathering." Political interference, Lord Grade added, would cross "a red line". Using the BBC - of which he was chairman from 2004-2006 - as an example, Lord Grade said MPs debate but do not vote on the licence fee, despite it being a publicly-owned broadcaster. This, he insisted, "protects the editorial freedom of the BBC from political interference". But "as things now stand, Parliament will have more right to interfere in the editorial freedom of the press than it does in the editorial freedom of the BBC". "Bonkers, or what?" He said that, while the new charter will offer protection from exemplary damages for those who volunteer to sign up, "the implication of this is, of course, that those newspapers who don't sign up will run the risk of incurring those exemplary - or rather, punitive damages." "In other words," he continued, "There's a carrot to attract the press, but there's also a stick - potentially a very large and very expensive stick - available to beat up the press who don't like the look of the carrot." The Society of Editors, founded in 1999, represents almost 450 national, regional and local newspapers, magazines, broadcasters and websites. It campaigns for media freedom and freedom of expression and information. During his speech, Lord Grade voiced his support for the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), which has been put forward by a group of major newspaper publishers. Its proposals include the power to investigate serious and systemic breaches of its code, even if no complaints have been made, and the power to levy fines of up to £1m. "Let's really get behind Ipso and get it up and running as soon as possible," he said. "Let's keep our minds open and let's be prepared to tighten things up if experience shows it's necessary. "Above all, let's do our damnedest to restore public confidence." </body>

      <body>How many legs does a scorpion have? If you look closely at the design recently tattooed onto the skin of BBC Question Time presenter David Dimbleby, the answer appears to be six. But scorpions - members of the arachnida class along with spiders - actually have eight legs, as well as their distinctive pincers. So the big question for the 75-year-old broadcaster is whether there is a sting in the tail following his first venture into the world of tattoos - and has he left himself a little short in the leg department? Asked if there was such a thing as a six-legged scorpion, an expert at London Zoo's invertebrates section told the BBC News website that while there were always exceptions in the animal kingdom - "there are birds that don't fly" - he was unaware of any six-legged scorpions. The related arachnids known as whip scorpions only had six "walking legs", he added - but they had two more legs which they used as feelers. The Natural History Museum was also adamant that scorpions have eight legs, not six - "unless you were to chop two of them off". However, a spokesman did point out that some insects (six-legged arthropods) can look a bit like scorpions, for example, the Devil's Coach Horse. Mr Dimbleby's agent said the presenter was unavailable for comment. However, the east London studio which drew the tattoo told the BBC website that staff had reproduced a design which Mr Dimbleby provided. It should be noted that the 2004 single The Scorpion by the American thrash metal band Megadeth features a scorpion with only six visible legs on its cover, but it is not known whether Mr Dimbleby is a fan of their output. Speaking earlier to the Radio Times, Mr Dimbleby said: "You are only old once. I have always wanted a tattoo." He added that the tattoo represented his star sign, Scorpio. He got the tattoo while making the maritime series, Britain and the Sea, which will be shown on BBC One on Sunday. Since Mr Dimbleby's scorpion tattoo, his brother and fellow broadcaster Jonathan has tweeted: "How do you know I haven't got a tattoo already - just more discreet about it?" And his BBC colleague Jane Garvey, presenter of BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, tweeted: "I've had a tattoo of David Dimbleby for years. Who hasn't?" And comedian Jack Dee tweeted: "Just seen Dimbleby park his Harley outside Leather-Jackets-R-Us. "Welcome to Question Time" or "Yo, Wha's up?" As it's now called." Britain and the Sea, made in partnership with the National Maritime Museum, starts on Sunday 17 November at 21:00 GMT on BBC One. </body>

His latest documentary, Once Upon a Forest, which is released in Europe on 13 November, is based on an original idea by the French botanist Francis Halle. Prof Halle explained that he had been "looking for a filmmaker for 25 years" in order to tell the story of how a primary forest is born. He added that he wanted to tell this story before the last primary forests on Earth disappear. BBC News met with Prof Halle and Mr Jacquet at the Blue Ocean Film Festival in Monaco and asked them how a botanist's passion became a feature film.

      <title>Poirot: Suchet bids a fond farewell</title>
      <description>David Suchet on Poirot's enduring appeal</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24817590</url>
      <date>1384307908</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/71082000/gif/_71082639_poiror2.gif</thumbnail>
      <body>After 25 years playing the Belgian detective, David Suchet is preparing to say goodbye to Hercule Poirot as the iconic character attempts to solve his final case on the small screen. Curtain: Poirot's Last Case will see the elderly detective call on old friend Captain Hastings (Hugh Fraser) for assistance as they return to the scene of their first case, Styles Court, to try to prevent another murder. Times have changed irrevocably since Suchet first graced our television screens in the now world-famous role back in 1989. But the actor, 67, believes the public's appetite for the gentle drama is as strong as it ever was. "Crime drama… has changed completely… it's become very dark and extraordinarily violent," says Suchet. "That's not the world of Agatha Christie and the fact that he's still so popular must say a lot about the public - that they actually don't need the blood and gore and the sex and the drama." Nevertheless, Suchet will not be reprising his role in any future television versions of Poirot, having filmed every book Christie wrote around the character. "It's grieving. I'm saying goodbye to a character I've been and have got to know over 25 years… it's goodbye to a best friend as an actor, as someone I've got to know. "But everything has its time and this is the right time, there are no more Agatha Christie films to make. So that's it." Interestingly, Suchet credits a "dreadful performance" in an earlier Poirot TV film with helping him establish himself in the title role of the long-running ITV series. He was first spotted by members of the Agatha Christie estate, including her granddaughter, in 1985's Blott on the Landscape. "Then they saw me give the dreadful performance I gave in Peter Ustinov's Poirot film Thirteen at Dinner. I played Inspector Japp and it was the worst performance I've ever given," he says candidly. "It was a good thing I gave such a bad performance because they went on to make a series of films with Peter Ustinov for American television. "If I'd have been brilliant as Inspector Japp, I would have carried on [in that role] and I would never have been accepted to play Poirot." Endearingly, Suchet speaks of Poirot like an old friend as he explains why the detective still attracts so many fans. "He has an enormous charm… he loves people, he has a wonderful ear and he listens well. "For women, he has no ulterior motive… if a young lady was drunk in the street at two o'clock in the morning and he found her, she would feel perfectly safe, he would be totally honourable. He is asexual," says Suchet. "My son-in-law described him as the greatest moral compass," he adds fondly. The actor says that when he watches early re-runs of Poirot, he realises "it has changed. He's more settled now, more mature in himself. "I think he's less performed, he's been fleshed out a little bit. We've got more of his loneliness and his darker side, which is what Agatha Christie wrote." Suchet says that because he "never knew from one year or the next whether I would be playing him again… I never had any options taken out on me, it was just whether the phone would ring or not," it prevented him from the actor's curse - being typecast. "By me not knowing [if I would play him again], I could take all those wonderful theatre roles like Oleanna [directed by Harold Pinter in 1993], Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf with Diana Rigg, Amadeus, Arthur Miller's All My Sons opposite Zoe Wanamaker, and Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey Into Night. "My character acting has been… enhanced by Poirot, because he's given me the profile - people will use me because Poirot has been successful." On Wednesday, Suchet and his wife "will do what we've done every first night of Poirot on television. "We won't record it, we'll sit there with one glass of wine and just watch it and toast each other at the end and say 'that's it'." So what next, now that the debonair detective has been put to bed? Next year Suchet will embark on a world tour of The Last Confession, a play he starred in at London's Theatre Royal Haymarket and the Chichester Festival Theatre. The actor describes it as "a Vatican mystery about John Paul I who was Pope for 33 days". "My wife [Sheila Ferris] is going to be in the play with me - she's playing the only nun. It gives me a chance to say thank you to all those countries who have watched my Poirot." It is very much evident that thoughts of slowing down and lessening his workload are far from Suchet's mind. "People don't really retire in my business - the phone just stops ringing! If it stops ringing for 15 years and you're still alive I suppose that could be called honourable retirement," he jokes. "If you don't want to work, all you have to say is 'no' which is the hardest word in the English language for any actor. I'll be saying yes for hopefully a few more years." Curtain: Poirot's Last Case airs at 20:00 GMT on 13 November on ITV. David Suchet's book, Poirot and Me, is out now. </body>

      <title>Obituary: Sir John Tavener</title>
      <description>The life and career of composer Sir John Tavener</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10881314</url>
      <date>1384277361</date>

      <body>Sir John Tavener was a composer who wove spirituality and mysticism into his writing. His early avant garde works contrasted strongly with the later pieces for which he became better known. Sir John was born on 28 January 1944 in London, a direct descendant of the 16th Century composer John Tavener. A skilled pianist and organist, he went to school in Highgate, North London, before going on to study at the Royal Academy of Music. Sir John first came to public attention in 1968 with the premiere of his oratorio, The Whale. The work, based on the biblical story of Jonah, was played at the debut concert of the London Sinfonietta and later recorded on the Beatles' Apple label. In 1977, he became a convert to the Russian Orthodox Church, having been persuaded that Eastern traditions retained an essence that had been lost in the west. Already a deeply religious man, his faith became an increasingly important part of his life and works and he once described music as "the essence of God". "Through the very fact that I write sacred music, my concern with music and God take place all the time," he said. His works from this period reflect this new influence in his life, particularly The Lamb, based on the William Blake poem of the same name, and the choral work Resurrection. His music was introduced to a new audience in 1989 when the premiere of The Protecting Veil was played at the BBC Proms by the London Symphony Orchestra. In 1992, he was nominated for the prestigious Mercury Prize - and again in 1997 - ultimately losing out to Primal Scream and drum and bass producer Roni Size. In 1994, he celebrated his 50th birthday with The Apocalypse, another major commission for the Proms. The popularity of his works was highlighted in 1997 when his piece A Song for Athene, was performed at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales. Sir John dedicated his piece Eternity's Sunrise, based on poetry by William Blake, to the memory of the late Princess. The premiere of A New Beginning played out the final minutes of the 20th Century at the Millennium Dome in London and he was knighted in the New Year's Honours List. Five days later, Fall and Resurrection received its premiere at St Paul's Cathedral and was broadcast on both television and radio. His work remained much in demand with the San Francisco-based Chanticleer commissioning Lamentations and Praises. Their subsequent recording won the Grammy award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition in 2003. Although he remained an Orthodox Christian, Tavener increasingly explored the beliefs of other faiths in his music. The Veil of the Temple uses both Christian and Islamic texts while Hymn of Dawn contains Hindu, Sufi and Jewish influences as well as the music of native American tradition. In 2007, the BBC Symphony Orchestra premiered his work The Beautiful Names, which is based on the 99 names of Allah from the Koran. His Requiem, commissioned for the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus and performed at Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral in February 2008, won widespread acclaim. Ill health, however, dogged him most of his life. He suffered from Marfan Syndrome, an inherited condition that attacks the body's connective tissue. Having survived a major stroke at the age of 30, he suffered a heart attack in December 2007. Critics often suggested that Tavener's music was not influenced by religion but was merely a substitute for it, complaining that his minimalism was just "simple music for simple desires." Tavener dismissed this as pure cynicism. "We're literally living in a dark age," he once said. "Anything that comes from anywhere that has a spark of the divine is worth taking." In June 2013, he premiered three new works, all written after his heart attack, at the Manchester International Festival. They included one based on a "rather terrifying" short story by Leo Tolstoy, The Death of Ivan Ilyich, in which the central character seeks redemption as he stares into the void of death. He told the BBC at the time: "When I became ill in Switzerland and I became conscious for the first time, the religious zeal that I had before, I found had gone." He continued: "But so had my ability to write music. It was about three years without doing anything, I just wanted to lie in a darkened room. And the faith came back in a different way, with writing. "I think I've been very lucky all my life because the writing and the faith seem to go together." </body>

      <description>A Victorian model's tragic story set for the stage</description>

      <body>In 1849, Lizzie Siddal was plucked from obscurity to pose for some of the best-known painters of the Victorian art world. Now her tragic life story is being brought to the stage for the first time. Elizabeth Siddal has been described by one biographer as a "Pre-Raphaelite supermodel". The most well-known story about her time as a painter's subject is when she almost died while posing in a bathtub for Sir John Everett Millais as he painted his drowning Ophelia in 1852. It was just one extraordinary incident in Siddal's short life - she died aged 32 - which features in a new play that premieres in London this month. "We were genuinely surprised that no-one had done it [on stage] before, because it seems like such a gift of a story," says actress Emma West, who plays the lead role in Lizzie Siddal. The Siddal story was most recently told on TV in BBC Two's Desperate Romantics in 2009. At the rehearsal space in south London, where the new play is taking shape, all eyes are drawn to the full-size reproduction of the Millais painting propped against the wall - with Ophelia singing as she sinks to a watery grave. The scene, described in Shakespeare's Hamlet, is one of the best-known works of Pre-Raphaelite art and is the most popular postcard sold by the Tate, which has the original in its permanent collection. "It's one of those paintings you can't tire of looking at - it is so vibrant and lifelike," says West. With her red hair and pale complexion, the actress looks uncannily like the tragic figure in the picture. Indeed, she recalls how on the two occasions she has visited the Tate to see the work, complete strangers have asked her to pose in front of it. "The last time it was a couple of Japanese tourists who were quite freaked out [by the resemblance], it seemed to me." So who was Lizzie Siddal? Born in 1829, she was aged around 20 and working in a hat shop when she was "discovered" by artist Walter Deverell. She soon became a favourite model for the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood - the group of young painters who wanted to revolutionise the Victorian art world. Over a period of several months, she posed for Millais' Ophelia in a bath full of water kept warm by lamps placed underneath. The lamps went out on one occasion and the water turned ice cold, although Siddal did not complain. Millais was so absorbed in his work and did not notice. Siddal fell ill, and her father threatened the artist with legal action until he agreed to pay the medical fees. Siddal also became an artist in her own right, although painting was an unusual career for a woman in those days. She became the muse of the artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and appeared in many of his works. After a long and turbulent engagement, they married in 1860, but a year afterwards Siddal had a stillborn daughter. Suffering depression and addicted to laudanum, Siddal died in February 1862. "The more you read about her the more fascinating she becomes," says playwright Jeremy Green. "Here's a woman who, with no advantages, became famous as a model; but that wasn't sufficient, she wanted to produce art and, falling in love, she wanted to be fulfilled in her love - and in pursuit of both she met tragic consequences. "It's a play about love and death and immortality." The idea for the play, directed by Lotte Wakeham, goes back two years when Green wrote a short film, Ophelia, about the Millais "bathtub" incident. Emma West, who played Siddal in the film too, got a taste of what the Victorian model went through in Millais' studio. "I had the experience of lying in the bath - the longest I did was five or six hours," she recalls. "That's a helpful thing to have done, despite the fact that my fingers were prune-like. The crew were scooping cold water out and pouring in hot water so I was fine." West adds: "It's tempting to think, 'How cruel of Millais', but actually there was nothing to stop Lizzie saying, 'It's getting a bit cold now'. But she didn't. "She chose to try and be the perfect model for him. That's a fantastic clue to her psychology, because what made her attractive to these painters is that she did have a sense of understanding of what they were trying to achieve." As well as seeing the Ophelia painting at the Tate, West also visited Lizzie Siddal's grave in the Rossetti family plot in London's Highgate Cemetery. She was told by the cemetery guide that it is a place of pilgrimage for Lizzie Siddal devotees. "It's predominantly men, who get far more emotional than the women do!" What were her emotions standing at the grave? "I feel a sense of responsibility. When I knew we were going to tell her story I felt I should pay my respects in some way, just to say, 'We're taking this seriously and I hope we do you justice.'" West, meanwhile, describes Siddal as "a trailblazer". "She would dress differently and people would mock her sometimes and she didn't care. She was genuinely nourished by the art. "She was the genuine article." Lizzie Siddal is at the Arcola Theatre, London E8, from 20 November - 21 December 2013. </body>

      <description>Little Mix answer questions from Smash Hits</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24857918</url>

      <body>2011's X Factor winners Little Mix have come a long way in a short time. They've sold more than three million records in just over 18 months, and their debut album, DNA, charted at number four in the US - breaking a girl band record set by the Spice Girls. "We just couldn't believe it. I wanted to cry," says singer Perrie Edwards (high notes, engaged to Zayn from One Direction). "Americans just seem to be fascinated by British people in general," adds Jesy Nelson (impressive vibrato, terrifying mane of hair). "Even just the accent. They're fascinated by the way we speak". The quartet, completed by Leigh-Anne Pinnock (former waitress, huge grin) and Jade Thirlwall (quietly-spoken Geordie, constantly stifling yawns), have just released their follow-up album, Salute - a crisp, smart collection of pop songs inspired by the vocal harmonies of Destiny's Child and En Vogue. In honour of their US chart victory, we decided to ask Little Mix the questions Smash Hits magazine once asked the Spice Girls. "Oh my god, that is so fun!" shrieks Perrie. But then, she hasn't seen the questions yet. Leigh-Anne: Of course! Who's not played spin the bottle? But I never done the kiss version. I always wanted to, but I never did. We did the truth or dare one instead. But I always thought, what if they don't want to kiss you? Or what if they've got a weird thing on their lip? You'd have to run. All: Eurgh! Jade: [adopts unnatural yoga pose] Oh my God, I can! I'm really happy about that. I'd never do it, though. I'd get some sort of fungal infection in my mouth. Perrie: Geki oko punpun maru! It just means that I'm cross with you, but in a cute way, in Japanese. You know how in Japanese everything's cute? Kawaii! So when you're angry with someone, you just have to be cute! Leigh-Anne: I like Yabai! That just rolls off the tongue. It means sick, wicked in Japanese. Jesy: When I was younger, there was a guy and he was really good at skateboarding. So I got on a skateboard and thought that I could do it, and went flying down the hill and broke me arm in front of him. Leigh-Anne: Oooof. Jade: Did you cry in front of him? Jesy: Yeah it was horrible. I was so uncool. I thought he would love a little skater chick. Perrie: I wear boy's clothes. I wear Zayn's clothes but that's about it. I literally have a clearout every two months and I give all my clothes away to my little cousins and stuff. And they just buzz off it. If I was younger, and my cousin or sister was in Little Mix, and they gave me all their hand-me-downs, I'd be the happiest girl in the world. After your X Factor performance, someone wrote on YouTube: "This is the true amount of skin that should be shown, not like other artists, who are pretty much naked". Leigh-Anne: That's good. Perrie: It's a compliment. We don't want to gyrate on the floor with no clothes on, but we do want to look sexy. We're 20-odd years old, so we want to look nice and pretty and cool, but we do it in a way that's more mature. Jesy: Move is about not taking yourself too seriously, just letting yourself be free and having a good old boogie-woogie on the dancefloor, and not being too cool for school. Perrie: Which is what Little Mix are all about. Are you always the first on the floor? Perrie: First on the dancefloor and the last to leave. What's the one song that'll get you up? Leigh-Anne: Diamonds. Oh my God, I feel like I'm Rihanna when I'm dancing to that. Jade: What's that song "duh, duh, d-duh, d-duh, My heart beats like a drum, boom boom, boom boom?" [she means Kelly Marie's Feels Like I'm In Love, fact fans]. Perrie: It has a military feel all the way through. Is it true you had less time to record it than your debut? All:Yes! Perrie: We had plenty of time to write it, but 12 days to actually record all the vocals. Leigh-Anne: It was a gruelling process but do you know what? We got through it. So what's the process? Jade: So, we'll write the song with the beat and the production and stuff. Then once we've got a solid song it'll be like a demo - it might have our vocals on, it might have someone that we're writing with on it. Then we'll go back in and perfect it. Can you ever see yourselves producing your own album? All: Wow. Oh my God. Jade: I'd love to but, I mean, it's all on computers and that. Leigh-Anne: I can just about press play and pause. Jesy: We come up with so many ideas and sounds. That we can do. But I don't know about actually putting it together on the actual computer. Perrie: We don't miss a trick, though. Our label will come to us with a finished song and it'll be a different production, and we'll be like, 'what have you done! That drum beat's different, and what's that horn doing there?' And they'll be like, 'gosh, you literally don't miss anything.' Leigh-Anne: And that's why we've produced such an amazing album. Jesy: The path of what? Lead to what? I think it's asking whether you can discover things about yourself by over-indulging. Jesy: So can I learn from my mistakes? Yes, definitely, of course I do. What's the worst mistake you've made that's taught you a lesson? Perrie: Do you know what it is, right? When we do interviews and we get asked the same questions over and over, I'm like, 'I wish we'd get asked something different'. But when we do, I have no idea. I'm not prepared. Because it's hard to remember your own life! Jesy: Did she really? Did she say she was younger? Of course! You never make your showbiz age older. Perrie: People do lie about that, though, don't they?. Remember that girl on the X Factor ages ago? She auditioned, she got all the way through, but she couldn't do it because she was 16 and the age limit was still 18. Do you still get ID'd when you buy alcohol? Jesy: Oh, all the time. But surely people know who you are? Jade: I think they ask just to make sure it's you. Perrie: I was out with Anthony [Riach - Zayn Malik's best friend] and I went to the counter and the girl said, 'have you got any ID?' Anthony just went, 'Wikipedia her ass'. I was like, 'oh my God!' I would never say that myself, but it was so funny. Leigh-Anne: This is why I don't take ID to clubs - just in case they ask for it, then I can go, 'search me on Google, man'. Perrie: Well, we get a lot of fan mail and it gets sent to the office - so we never see it for ages, and then we have one day of going through it all. And it is mental. But our fans are absolutely incredible. Some of the gifts they send us, and the letters, everything is so amazing. We try and reply to as many fans as we can, especially on Twitter. That's the big difference between you and the Spice Girls. Back then, the only way a fan could get in contact was by sending a letter. But you seem to spend half your lives doing webchats and social networking. Jesy: We have to get the fans involved. They need to feel like they're a part of our journey. That's why they love us so much - they just relate to us. You always come across like regular people - but I note that two of you are wearing sunglasses indoors… Perrie: Only because we look ROUGH. Jesy: Yeah, we're very tired. Jade: I think people end up looking older when they get all that work done. Jesy: Some people have had Botox and they're so young. I just think 'why are you doing it?' Perrie: But we don't know how we're going to feel when we're 40. Jesy: Whatever makes you happy. If it makes you feel better about yourself, then I'm all for it. Perrie: Do you know you can get stuff in your feet? You get Botox put in the bottom of your feet, so when you go on nights out, your feet don't hurt. Do you know how weird that is? Leigh-Anne: But you see Botox? They don't really know the long-term effects of it. That's what scares me. I'm not sure I'd ever want to put botulism in my body. Leigh-Anne: Sorry, what is botulism? It's a toxin you can get from eating undercooked or diseased meat. It basically causes paralysis - and they use a sort of sterilised version of it in Botox injections. Leigh-Anne:WHAT? Does it, like, wear off? Yes, eventually. Leigh-Anne: That's mad. I couldn't do that to myself. And that concludes your lessons for the day! Perrie: Thank you! You're like a science teacher! Little Mix's album, Salute, is out now on Sony / Syco Records. </body>

      <title>John Lewis's Christmas ad: 10 interpretations</title>
      <description>Ten interpretations of the new John Lewis ad</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24901114</url>
      <date>1384193160</date>

      <body>John Lewis's Christmas advert is now one of the most discussed parts of the festive run-in. But what does this year's offering mean? The 2013 ad is an animated tale of a hare battling to ensure a bear doesn't miss out on the festivities accompanied by Lily Allen singing Keane's Somewhere Only We Know. While the bear is asleep, the hare sneaks back to his cave and deposits a small package wrapped in red paper and tied up with a green bow. "The store's animation, using old-fashioned line drawing (by artists who worked on The Lion King), features a rather grumpy brown bear and his friend, a hare, who looks - with his doleful eyes - as if he has jumped straight out of Watership Down to escape the bulldozers." says the Telegraph's Harry Wallop. BuzzFeed's Tom Phillips goes one step further. Alongside the headline "The John Lewis Christmas Ad: Alternate Ending" he links to a YouTube video simply entitled Watership Down Violence. He apologises swiftly after. James Murphy, the chief executive of Adam and Eve DDB - the agency that made the advert - reveals the agency was aware of the similarity early on. When he showed an early edit to his wife, she was crying "within 10 seconds". "She said the hare reminded her of the rabbit character" in Watership Down. John Lewis "has again eschewed celebrities in favour of trying to make you cry", observes Wallop. The marketing news site The Drum says John Lewis is "seeking to tug on the heartstrings". While it has touched some, it hasn't made everyone cry, notes Brand Republic. "Some 80% of the tweets praised the ad, describing it as 'cute' and 'sweet', while 5% of tweeters claimed the ad had reduced them to tears." One tweeter who did admit crying was Loren Saunders, who tweeted "I well up at the John Lewis advert everytime." "Part of its ambition, in the words of Craig Inglis, its marketing director, is to 'connect emotionally with our customers'," Wallop suggests. "The bear has never experienced Christmas because he spends all winter hibernating in a cave, we learn. This makes the hare even sadder, but he gives the sleeping bear a present in the hope he might be roused from his slumber and join in the woodland fun. Since the gift is an alarm clock, his ruse works." Murphy says his advertising agency inherited the same brief that the previous agency had "which is to talk about what we call thoughtful gifting. "There is a unifying theme. If you want to find a gift for someone you love that they would love then come to John Lewis." "The real star this year is the song," says Wallop. He calls the folksy style Allen adopts as "John Lewis's trademark tug-at-the-heartstrings style". Wallop thinks she's made a canny move. "She is in little doubt that it is a sensible 'way of stepping back into the marketplace' after three years away to have children." Campaign Magazine's Ben Bold says it's "the biggest advertising event of the year". Wallop cites research from market analysts Nielsen that claims retailers will spend about £390m on advertising over the last three months of 2013. John Lewis alone is spending £7m on its Christmas campaign. "This is a remarkable turn of events. Only a few years ago, it was predicted that TV advertising would slowly die, as we all started to watch programmes on catch-up boxes, such as Sky Plus, or on tablet computers." The Sun says X Factor viewers "branded the ad breaks better than the show itself". But the ad appears to miss out one vital component - the products they are trying to sell. "Not entirely sure how this helps sell Le Creuset casserole dishes," BuzzFeed's Tom Phillips muses. But from the 2011 ad onward the ads don't feature specific John Lewis products. Marketing Week's Sarah Vizard told the Guardian the retailer may appear to be trying not to be a retailer. John Lewis's marketing director Craig Inglis explains in the Guardian: "This is really about telling a story and making that emotional connection. It's not all about glitz and glamour, it's all about animation and the brand." If you watch the ad on YouTube and click on "follow the story" you're directed to a page where you can buy Lily Allen's single, the bear, the hare and Christmas cards of the bear and the hare, among other products related to the advert. When things get this subtle, customers can get confused. Marketing Magazine reports that the teaser to the advert, aired the previous week, confused some people into thinking about Coca-Cola. "ITV viewers got a sneak preview of John Lewis's Christmas ad last night when a teaser aired with the hashtag #sleepingbear, although some viewers believe Coca-Cola was behind the ad." All this leaves one question unanswered for Capital FM's Anna Tyler: "How can a hare wrap a present?" Beauty blogger Miss Candy points out: "Chinese people think buying someone a clock is extremely bad luck." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Plug pulled on rural broadband plans</title>
      <description>Two out of five alternative broadband schemes have been knocked back in favour of BT, the BBC has learned.</description>

      <body>A rural broadband group planning to offer superfast net services in Oxfordshire has been told that the project cannot go ahead, the BBC has learned. A similar project in Dorset was turned down last month. It comes just weeks after a report criticised the government for wasting taxpayers' money by giving all of its broadband funds to BT. Those involved are angry that BT will monopolise rural broadband rollouts. Both Oxfordshire and Dorset county councils have signed contracts with BT to provide broadband services to rural areas. These contracts mean that alternative schemes are no longer required. Having competition in the broadband market is important, think experts. "Some of the niche operators want to deliver better and faster services now, and don't understand how BT can win contracts on what they believe is a weaker product," said Sebastien Lahtinen, founder of broadband news site ThinkBroadband. BDUK, the group set up by government to oversee rural broadband rollouts, has been widely criticised for how it has handled the process. All contracts in England and Wales have been awarded to BT, which is providing so-called fibre-to-the-cabinet (FTTC) services to the majority of UK homes. Fibre to the cabinet provides fibre to the green street cabinets that are located in towns and villages around the UK but relies on old-fashioned copper connections to reach individual homes, meaning that the further a home is from the cabinet, the slower the service will be. Most of the rival rural broadband providers want to roll out fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) services, which run fibre all the way to premises and are faster than FTTC. As well as doubts about whether that is the best technology to use, there has been outrage that taxpayers' money has gone to a former telecom monopoly. A recent report from the Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said that the government needed to spend funds set aside to get superfast broadband to the last 10% of the UK more wisely. As part of the process to get broadband to the really hard-to-reach parts of the UK, broadband groups were encouraged to bid for a separate pot of money, known as the Rural Broadband Community fund. In July, Culture Secretary Maria Miller lent her support, saying that innovative broadband schemes like those in Dorset and Oxfordshire should "co-exist happily alongside the wider rural broadband scheme, led by BT." The Cotswolds Broadband scheme aimed to provide fibre-to-the-home services to 5,000 premises in West Oxfordshire. It was disappointed to find out that the scheme cannot go ahead. "Oxfordshire County Council has supported this all along but has now decided it is not going to separate it from their contracted plans with BT," said Hugo Pickering, head of Cotswolds Broadband. "We have already put in a whole lot of money and so the council is going to be liable for a compensation claim," said Mr Pickering. He believes his scheme would have offered better value for money for taxpayers because the majority of it is privately funded by residents and other interested parties. "We only wanted 34% of state aid, which is much lower than BT, which in some cases is asking for 90% state aid," he said. It is a point echoed by Steve Adamson, who runs a similar scheme in Dorset, aiming to run fibre networks along disused rail tracks. "Our scheme offered fibre to the home, which is not what BT is offering. It was going to be better and it was going to be cheaper," he said. "The decision was delayed until such time as the county council had signed its contract with BT. It became clear that BT intended to include the area we were going to cover leaving our scheme dead in the water." A third rural broadband scheme, B4RN, that is already up and running in Lancashire, is waiting to hear whether it will qualify for Rural Broadband Community funding. Chris Conder, one of the founders of B4RN, told the BBC: "There should be a level playing field and no cheating when it comes to taxpayers' money. BT is effectively stopping any innovation or competition and reducing the effectiveness of government support." B4RN is due to meet with BDUK shortly. Mr Lahtinen is not surprised that BT is dominating rural broadband. "BT has an existing nationwide wholesale broadband platform and channel which ensures consumers have a wide range of choice as to who they buy their broadband service from," he said. "Many councils are also likely to see BT as a 'safe option' as so many other councils have made the same decision." In response BT told the BBC: "It is up to the local council to decide who they work with on rural broadband. Having said that, a key consideration is that any network which benefits should be open to all ISPs to use. That way, local monopolies are avoided and customers have choice. "BT has spent huge sums developing systems that support such competition and it may be the case that small local operators can't meet those conditions and are therefore ineligible to receive public funds." </body>

      <title>Virgin Media cost and speed increase</title>
      <description>Virgin Media is increasing the cost of its broadband service but will offer a faster 152Mbps service from 2014.</description>

      <body>Virgin Media broadband customers will see bills rise by 6.7% from February. The company said the price rise would allow it to remain competitive and provide value for its customers. And it would at the same time begin a rollout to 12.5 million homes served by its fibre-optic broadband service of speeds up to 152Mbps. That rise, from 120Mbps, would allow users to download a high-definition (HD) film in less than four minutes and a music album in four seconds, it said. The company said it was also working to increase the speed of other broadband services by up to 20Mbps. "This is probably the last time that customers will have to take this kind of price hike on the chin," said Dominic Baliszewski, from website broadbandchoices.co.uk. "New rules from Ofcom governing mid-contract price rises will come into effect from early 2014, forcing providers to give customers the opportunity to cancel their contract without financial penalty if they increase prices during their contract term." Virgin Media's chief executive officer Tom Mockridge said: "As people connect more things simultaneously to the internet more often, they need powerful broadband with the bandwidth to deliver a great experience for everyone in the home." Mr Baliszewski added: "For example, 10 people could all be watching HD video content separately without experiencing any buffering." According to Ofcom, the industry regulator, the average residential broadband speed across the UK is 14.7Mbps. But this increases to 43.6Mbps where the user is connected to the fibre-based network. The latest figures show 19% of homes have taken up a superfast service, with speeds of 30Mbps. BT has previously announced their broadband customers will face a price rise of 6.5% from January 2014. </body>

      <title>US file-sharing traffic in decline</title>
      <description>BitTorrent traffic in the US has dipped, according to a new study, indicating that piracy might be on the decline.</description>

      <body>BitTorrent traffic is in decline in the US for the first time, according to a new study. The protocol, used by many pirate sites as well as legal services, allows people to download files bit by bit. It saw its share of total internet traffic fall to 7%, a drop of 20% in the past six months. However, in Europe traffic continues to grow. Meanwhile, other video content is riding high - with NetFlix and YouTube accounting for 50% of all net traffic. The report, from broadband measurement firm Sandvine, shows a sharp decrease in the bandwidth taken up by BitTorrent traffic, some of which is associated with the downloading of illegal music and movies. Ten years ago, when Sandvine began compiling its twice-yearly Global Internet Phenomena Report, BitTorrent traffic accounted for 60% of the total. The latest figures suggest that, as well as its share falling, there could be less overall BitTorrent traffic on the network. But in Europe, BitTorrent remains popular, with half of all uploaded traffic still attributed to the protocol. Torrent-based peer-to-peer file sharing is on the decrease, partly because people are turning to other ways to swap material. The use of "dark nets" such as Tor and encrypted digital lockers is growing in popularity. These can be harder to track. But also people are simply turning to legitimate services. "If this trend continues I think it can most likely be explained by the increase in legal alternatives people have in the United States. In Europe and other parts of the world, it's much harder to watch recent films and TV shows on demand so unauthorised BitTorrent users continue to grow there," said Ernesto Van Der Dar, founder of news site TorrentFreak. Mark Mulligan, an independent analyst, agrees. "We are finally at the start of having enough compelling legitimate services that the reasons for piracy begin to fade," he said. "That doesn't mean that a hardcore of users won't continue to use these sites because they will." Copyright holders in both the US and Europe have taken a tough stance on internet piracy in recent months. In the UK about 28 sites, including many that use the BitTorrent protocol, have been blocked by ISPs following court orders from rights holders. In the US, the government launched the US Copyright Alert in March. The system is also known as Six Strikes because it allows users six chances to stop infringing copyright. It involves sending a series of warnings - the first two tell consumers that they have been spotted downloading illegal content and suggest alternatives sources. The next two warnings pop up as a message on users' browsers, which people must acknowledge before they can continue. After that the ISP will begin to throttle bandwidth or block websites. In July, France put an end to a similar policy that threatened persistent offenders with internet bans. The culture minister said that the penalty - fines of up to 1,500 euros ($2,000; £1,250) - was disproportionate. Copyright holders continue to pursue piracy in all its forms on the web, and websites that publish song lyrics have become the latest target. The US National Music Publishers' Association, an organisation set up to protect the copyright of songwriters, said that it had sent takedown notices to 50 sites that it claimed profited from advertising around lyrics "without compensating songwriters". </body>

      <title>Apple and Samsung back in court</title>
      <description>Apple and Samsung are heading back to court in a row over damages awarded in a patent action.</description>

      <body>Apple and Samsung are returning to court in one of the most high-profile patent battles of recent times. In August 2012, a jury found Samsung guilty of infringing six Apple patents and awarded one of the largest payouts of its kind on record. The verdict and $1bn (£626m) awarded in damages were seen as a massive victory for Apple. This is just one of many patent cases the two companies are fighting in courtrooms across the world. In March 2013, a judge re-examined the $1bn awarded to Apple and reduced the amount saying the damages would need to be assessed at a new trial. Judge Lucy Koh said the original jury in the court in California had incorrectly calculated part of the damages. The judge said that $550m of the award had been worked out in the proper manner but she ordered that the remaining $450m be reassessed. That $450m could be increased or lowered meaning that Apple could conceivably end up with more than the original $1bn awarded at the first trial. Apple had originally sought $2.5bn in damages from Samsung. It argued that the South Korean company had copied its designs for the bodies of the original iPhone and iPad as well as user-interface elements such as the bounce-back response when a person scrolls beyond the end of list and tap-to-zoom. Samsung argued it was already working on rounded rectangular handsets dominated by a screen and a single button months before the iPhone was revealed. It sought $519m in damages from Apple. At the time of the original ruling Samsung said the decision was bad news for consumers and would "lead to fewer choices, less innovation, and potentially higher prices". Apple said it applauded the court "for finding Samsung's behaviour wilful and for sending a loud clear message that stealing isn't right". Even after this latest trial, which will involve a new jury, both companies could appeal. "I think they will appeal unless they settle," intellectual property consultant Florian Mueller told the BBC. "But at this point neither party has enough leverage to force someone into settling if they don't want to. And we're not there yet," he said. Apple has asked for a sales ban to be imposed on the Samsung products that had been found to infringe the patents. But the judge ruled that Apple could adequately be compensated financially. "Between these types of big players a $1bn damages award is not as bad as a sales ban," said Mr Mueller. Apple appealed against that ruling and the result of the appeal is due before the end of the year. Samsung and Apple are currently locked in a battle in the courts of more than 10 countries across Europe. But some senior technology experts believes the legal conflict is bad for consumers. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak told the BBC recently that: "There are good things I see on Samsung phones that I wish were in my iPhone; I wish Apple would use them, and could use them, and I don't know if Samsung would stop us. "I wish everybody just did a lot of cross-licensing and sharing the good technology; all our products would be better, we'd go further. "I do kind of wish they were more compatible." In October, Samsung offered to stop taking rivals to court in Europe over alleged infringements of certain types of patents for a period of five years. The European Union authorities have taken the "preliminary view" that the South Korean company's litigious actions were stifling competition. Samsung faces a potential £11.3bn ($18.3bn) fine if found guilty of breaching European anti-trust laws. </body>

      <body>An electrical current capable of charging a mobile phone has been created from microwave signals. A team from Duke University said the technology they had used had been as efficient as using solar panels. The device they created used metamaterials, which capture various forms of wave energy and convert them for other applications. In the future, satellite, sound or wi-fi signals could be "harvested", according to the US researchers. "We're showing... these materials can be useful for consumer applications," said engineering student Alexander Katko. Using fibreglass and copper conductors on a circuit board, the researchers converted microwaves into 7.3 volts of electricity. A USB charger, which is often used to recharge mobile phone batteries and cameras, provides about five volts. "We were aiming for the highest energy efficiency we could achieve," said team member Allen Hawkes. "We had been getting energy efficiency around 6-10%, but with this design we were able to dramatically improve energy conversion to 37%, which is comparable to what is achieved in solar cells." Metamaterials are artificial materials that display properties not usually found in nature. In future, the two students and their colleague Steven Cummer hope that the technology can be built in to mobile phones. This would allow the handsets to recharge wirelessly when not being used. They also believe that it could help users living in remote areas without access to the power grid. They would be able to "harvest" the energy from signals generated by mobile phone towers. "Our work demonstrates a simple and inexpensive approach to electromagnetic power harvesting," said Mr Cummer. "The beauty of the design is that the basic building blocks are self-contained and additive. One can simply assemble more blocks to increase the scavenged power." The full report will be published in the journal Applied Physics Letters in December. </body>

      <title>Smartphone camera reveals Pin</title>
      <description>Cambridge University researchers warn that your Pin can be revealed by watching your face through your smartphone camera and listening for clicks through the microphone.</description>

      <body>The Pin for a smartphone can be revealed by its camera and microphone, researchers have warned. Using a program called PIN Skimmer, a team from the University of Cambridge found that codes entered on a number-only soft keypad could be identified. The software watches your face via the camera and listens to clicks through the microphone as you type. The tests were carried out on the Google Nexus-S and the Galaxy S3 smartphones. "We demonstrated that the camera, usually used for conferencing or face recognition, can be used maliciously," say the report's authors Prof Ross Anderson and Laurent Simon. According to the research, the microphone is used to detect "touch-events" as a user enters their Pin. In effect, it can "hear" the clicks that the phone makes as a user presses the virtual number keys. The camera then estimates the orientation of the phone as the user is doing this and "correlates it to the position of the digit tapped by the user". "We watch how your face appears to move as you jiggle your phone by typing," said Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University. "It did surprise us how well it worked," he told the BBC. When trying to work out four-digit Pins the programme was successful more than 50% of the time after five attempts. With eight-digit PINs the success rate was 60% after 10 attempts. Many smartphone users have a Pin code to lock their phone but they are increasingly used to access other types of applications on a smartphone, including banking apps. This raises the question of which resources should remain accessible on a phone when someone is entering a sensitive PIN, say the report's authors. "For instance when a call comes in, the user needs to hear the ring tone while unlocking his phone; otherwise he may assume the caller has hung up." One suggestion to prevent a PIN being identified is to use a longer number but the researchers warn this affects "memorability and usability". "Randomising" the position of numbers on the keypad is also suggested but the researchers believe this would "cripple usability on phones". Getting rid of passwords altogether and using fingerprints or face recognition are offered as more drastic solutions. "If you're developing payment apps, you'd better be aware that these risks exist," warns Prof Anderson. </body>

      <body>Blizzard has announced the fifth expansion for its flagship World of Warcraft (WoW) online game. Called the Warlords of Draenor it adds a new world to the game, lets players build settlements and instantly boost a character to high level. The announcement comes as WoW player numbers hit a five-year low and Blizzard starts to group players on a smaller number of servers. Blizzard has also unveiled plans for a new game called Heroes of the Storm. Details about Warlords of Draenor were unveiled at the annual Blizzcon gaming convention. The expansion involves a time-travelling storyline that will see players re-enact some of the events from the series of Warcraft strategy games that predated WoW. The expansion is set on the world of Draenor and gives players a series of new zones, dungeons and instances to play on. Warlords lets characters play at level 100, introduces player settlements called garrisons and updates the look of some of the game's different races. Blizzard said buyers of Warlords would be able to boost one character to level 90 so they could instantly go adventuring in the world of the expansion. No release date for Warlords has yet been given. The news comes soon after Blizzard revealed that subscriber numbers for WoW had dropped to about 7.7 million. The last time they were this low was in 2007 and they are significantly down on the 2010 high of 12 million. To manage this decline, Blizzard has introduced a system that lets people play across servers to ensure the game's economy, Player-versus-Player areas and arena battle systems have enough people participating to keep them functioning. Writing on the Rock Paper Shotgun game news site, Nathan Grayson described Warlords of Draenor as a "decent expansion" but said the decision to re-visit Warcraft's past was "puzzling". "This is maintenance, in a sense," he wrote. "Something to keep existing players interested and happy. And who knows? Maybe the focus that a smaller audience allows will be good for WoW in the long run." Blizzcon also saw the announcement of a new game called Heroes of the Storm. This is an arena-based hero brawling game that lets people take control of key characters from almost every game Blizzard makes including Starcraft and Diablo. The heroes are united in teams and fight rivals for dominance on one of a series of different maps. A beta test of Heroes is currently under way and Blizzard said the finished game would be released "soonish". </body>

      <title>Vodafone profits in 'tough' trading</title>
      <description>Vodafone reports a half-year pre-tax profit of £1.5bn ($2.4bn) as it says trading in Europe remained "very tough at present".</description>

      <body>Vodafone has reported a half-year pre-tax profit of £1.5bn ($2.4bn) as it said trading in Europe remained "very tough at present". Chief executive Vittorio Colao said he had seen "intense macroeconomic, regulatory and competitive pressures during the period" there. But he was "encouraged" by forecasts that Europe would return to growth. Mr Colao said the emerging markets businesses were doing well thanks to the smartphone. He said he hoped for a shift in regulation to support industry investment and consolidation. Mr Colao said mature markets were "challenging", but that focusing on cost efficiency was helping. The figure marks a big fall from its £3.9bn half-year pre-tax profit in 2012. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said the fall in profits was mainly due to Vodafone's difficulties in Europe. He said there were some "issues under the bonnet", such as regulatory concerns and Vodafone's performance in India, as well as the "famously" competitive mobile phone industry. But he added: "Nonetheless, the outlook over the horizon is bright." Vodafone's results came at the same time as fellow UK telecoms firm TalkTalk revealed a £9m pre-tax loss for the six months to the end of September. The drop compared with a £46m profit for the same period last year. Despite the swing into loss, shares in TalkTalk rose over 10%, buoyed by the company's higher forecast for revenue growth. It said this would be at least 3%, up from 2% for the full financial year. TalkTalk, which offers broadband, fixed line and mobile telecoms and TV services, said the pre-tax loss reflected the investments it had made, mainly in its TV service, during the period. The firm said it had signed up 167,000 new customers for its TV service in the three months to the end of September, putting it on track to have nearly a million viewers by the end of next year. "We are delighted with the progress we have made in the first half," said Dido Harding, TalkTalk chief executive. Meanwhile, Vodafone, the world's second-largest mobile operator said it plans to spend £7bn on improving its networks by March 2016. The move follows Vodafone's deal in September to sell its US business to Verizon Communications for $130bn. The US arm made up 45% of Vodafone's business, and the deal marked one of the largest to date in corporate history. As part of its growth plan, "Project Spring", the introduction of 4G networks, will be accelerated and investment for laying fibre optic cables increased, to allow Vodafone to offer faster broadband to its customers. </body>

      <title>Security risk to 70,000 card holders</title>

      <body>Up to 70,000 people in Ireland who took advantage of a customer loyalty offer could have been victims of a "sophisticated criminal attack". The company, Loyaltybuild, said it had suffered a security data breach. Supermarket chain Supervalu has asked 62,500 people involved in its Getaway Breaks scheme to contact their banks - 6,800 of those are in Northern Ireland. AXA Ireland has said up to 8,000 of its customers may have been affected. Loyaltybuild has advised the Data Protection Commissioner of Ireland and the police. Data Protection Commissioner Billy Hawkes said that affected customers should check financial transactions on cards over the last two years. "It's important that the customers affected actually look and check with their financial institutions, identify if there are any transactions they didn't authorise," he told Irish State Broadcaster RTÉ. He said inspectors will visit Loyaltybuild in Ennis in County Clare to carry out an independent investigation. Mr Hawkes said it was a serious breach and his team will be attempting to see just how much information criminals have gained. "We'll also find out if, for example, other types of information might have been accessed such as passwords and so on because people often use the same password on different sites." In a statement on its website, Loyaltybuild said: "As part of our ongoing investigation, into a system breach identified last month, Loyaltybuild has discovered that it has been the victim of a sophisticated criminal attack. "We are working around the clock with our security experts to get to the bottom of this and to further enhance our security in order to protect our valued customers, who are of paramount importance to us." The breach was discovered on 25 October and a third party firm has been running forensic tests. Supervalu said the incident was more extensive than initially thought. Customers who made Getaway Break bookings between January 2011 and February 2012 have been advised to contact their financial institutions. Customers are also being warned to treat any unsolicited communication claiming to represent Supervalu Getaway Breaks or Loyaltybuild with "extreme caution". Supervalu said it was continuing to work with Loyaltybuild to resolve the issue as quickly as possible but had also engaged its own IT security consultants to investigate the Loyaltybuild system. It also emphasised that the breach of security was in data collected and held by Loyaltybuild on Getaway Breaks customers only and did not involve other customers of Supervalu. AXA Ireland confirmed its customers' data may also have been compromised by the Loyaltybuild breach. In a statement, the company said: "Loyaltybuild's forensic team has now advised that there is a high risk that an unauthorised third party accessed details of payment cards used to pay for AXA Leisure Breaks between January 2011 and February 2012. "This investigation is still ongoing in relation to whether other personal data of customers has been compromised," it added. AXA said all other customer transactions by payment card were unaffected. Stena Line has said it is working with LoyaltyBuild to establish the extent of the security breach after it was involved with what the company said was a small scale, tactical hotel promotion. It urged customers to contact Stena Line at 01 204 7777 if they have concerns over the breach. </body>

      <body>Pegatron Corporation, the Taiwanese company that assembles Apple's iPhone 5C, has reported lower-than-expected profits. Analysts have said that Pegatron is experiencing slower orders for the 5C, which is Apple's cheaper smartphone. Net profits were T$2.48bn ($84m; £53m) for its third quarter, slightly below analyst forecasts, but higher than the T$1.35bn it made last year. Pegatron also makes laptops for Lenovo and former parent Asustek Computer. The company's share price hit an all-time high in May on reports that it was winning orders away from rival Hon Hai Precision Industry, another established Apple supplier. But in a recent research note Nomura said it was downgrading the stock from "buy" to "neutral" blaming "deteriorating orders for 5C and risks of new EMS [Electronics Manufacturing Services] makers taking market share". The bank added that it saw "a lack of positive catalysts in the near term". And last week the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was considering adding another Taiwan-based manufacturer, Wistron, to its roster of iPhone 5C makers, potentially increasing competition for Pegatron and reducing profit margins. In October, Apple reported falling fourth quarter profits of $7.5bn (£4.6bn), despite iPhone sales rising 26% to 33.8 million. These were the first earnings to include sales of Apple's new iPhone models: the iPhone 5s and the cheaper iPhone 5C, which is designed to appeal to the Chinese market. However Apple does not break out sales figures for the iPhone 5C. Over the summer Pegatron was criticised by human rights group China Labor Watch, which accused the company of workplace violations in three of its factories. The group said it found evidence of "at least 86 labour rights violations, including 36 legal violations and 50 ethical violations" following an undercover investigation. Apple is known to be diversifying its list of suppliers and looking increasingly to Chinese manufacturers. </body>

      <title>Switch on for 4G service in Cumbria</title>
      <description>Mobile operator EE activates its 4G service in Cumbria, offering superfast broadband to homes and businesses in the northern fells.</description>

      <body>Mobile operator EE has turned on its 4G service in Cumbria, offering superfast broadband to more than 2,000 homes and businesses in the northern fells. The move follows trials in the Threlkeld area, where users experienced average download speeds of 24Mbps. The company plans to roll out 4G across the rest of Cumbria (another 100 sq-miles) by March next year. Experts said the cost of delivering superfast broadband wirelessly was much less than using fibre cables. Welcoming the switch on, Rural Affairs Minister Dan Rogerson said: "Nothing will have a more spectacular effect on the rural economy than the roll out of superfast broadband and high speed mobile access. "I don't believe any rural business should be held back because of its location, so it's great that 2,600 Cumbrian homes and businesses are now covered by a superfast network." EE chief executive Olaf Swantee said: "There is a lot of work to do in 2014 to reach more people and businesses in rural areas. "But today we have proved that 4G has the capability to connect this country's unconnected [premises], and we intend to continue to be at the forefront of that." Mal Hilton, chairman of the Northern Fells Broadband Group: "We have been working for the past three years to ensure rural parishes in this area of Cumbria do not miss out on the high speed broadband developments that are taking place across the UK. "It has been a frustrating time and most commercial companies have demonstrated a complete lack of interest. "For the residents of the northern fells this is a significant milestone in the journey towards a complete superfast broadband service and one we welcome wholeheartedly." Packages starting from £25 a month will be available from 6 December. </body>

      <title>Bookshops lash out at Amazon offer</title>
      <description>An initiative by Amazon to sell Kindle readers in independent bookshops is met with hostility among shop owners.</description>

      <body>Bookshop owners have hit back at an initiative by Amazon to sell its Kindle e-book reader in independent shops. The Amazon Source programme, launching first in the US, would let bookshops sell the devices and receive a small cut of e-book sales thereafter. But reaction has been hostile - one US bookseller described it as "inviting hungry foxes into the henhouse". Amazon said bookshops "should be striving to offer customers what they want". Announcing the initiative earlier this week the company said: "With Amazon Source, customers don't have to choose between e-books and their favourite neighbourhood bookstore - they can have both." However, it appeared bookshop owners were not convinced. New York-based publisher Melville House gathered opinions, and posted the frosty responses on its website. "Hmmm, let's see," wrote Carole Horne from Harvard Book Store in Massachusetts. "We sell Kindles for essentially no profit, the new Kindle customer is in our store where they can browse and discover books, the new Kindle customer can then check the price on Amazon and order the e-book. "We make a little on their e-book purchases, but then lose them as a customer completely after two years. Doesn't sound like such a great partnership to me." Staff at Skylight Books in California said it was "a Trojan Horse-style attempt to gain access to our customers". Amazon has not yet announced whether it has plans to extend the scheme to the UK. However, retailer Waterstones began selling the Kindle device in its stores earlier this year, despite managing director James Daunt previously describing Amazon as a "ruthless, money-making devil". Mr Daunt admitted that readers were migrating to digital platforms, but that it was beyond the company's capabilities to develop and manufacture its own device. But whether independent bookshops will welcome the same logic is as yet unclear. The resentment stateside was welcomed by Patrick Neale, president of the Booksellers Association and co-owner of Jaffe and Neale bookshop and cafe in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. "I was really pleased to see that American independent bookshops were saying no thanks," he told the BBC. "We've stopped and thought about it because we're business people. But you've got to draw a line in the sand somewhere - they are destroying the high street. "To do anything in collaboration would be wrong to our customers - it would be a very confusing message." He added that a more favourable e-book deal for bookshops would be directly with publishers, with various discussions of that nature currently taking place. Mr Neale's view was shared by Fran Crumpton, company manager at the Book Partnership, a group that helps independent bookshops set up online operations. She too believed most bookshops would be opposed to the deal. "Why should they be selling Amazon's products? That will then stop people using their bookshops - and we are losing so many. That's what many bookshops are thinking." Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <body>A man who ran an online "wallet service" for storing Bitcoins has claimed hackers stole virtual currency from his site worth more than one million Australian dollars. The Australian man said 4,100 Bitcoins (US$1.04m, £650,000) were taken in two separate attacks. He said he would not report the theft to police as Bitcoin transactions are virtually impossible to trace. This has led some users to speculate whether it was an "inside job". In a radio interview with ABC News the man, who only used his online name TradeFortress, denied being involved. The Bitcoin virtual currency is increasingly used to pay for things online. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the theft occurred on 26 October but users were only alerted this week via a message he posted on the wallet service's website. "I know this doesn't mean much, but I'm sorry, and saying that I'm very sad that this has happened is an understatement. "Please don't store Bitcoins on an internet-connected device, regardless if it is your own or a service's." Bitcoin is the most well known of a handful of virtual currencies. The currencies are developed through a computer process called "mining" and can be traded on exchanges or privately between users. </body>

      <title>'Lover Spy' hacker FBI 'most wanted'</title>

      <body>A man who allegedly created malware purporting to catch out cheating lovers has made it on to the FBI's "most wanted" list of cybercriminals. The FBI says Carlos Enrique Perez-Melara ran a website offering customers a way to "catch a cheating lover" by sending spyware masquerading as a greeting card. Opening the card downloaded the malware on to the recipient's computer and recorded keystrokes and messages. The "Lover Spy" program cost $89 (£55). Mr Perez-Melara was indicted in July 2005 but has avoided capture ever since, only now making it on to the FBI's most wanted list. He ran the operation from his San Diego home in 2003, the FBI says, while he was in the US on a student travel visa. The charges against Mr Perez-Melara, 33, included making, sending and advertising an interception device, and unlawfully intercepting electronic communications. The indictment said Lover Spy was designed "with stealth in mind, claiming that it would be impossible to detect by 99.9% of users". But Mr Perez-Melara has avoided the authorities ever since and his last known location was San Salvador, the FBI said. The agency appears to have added the hacker to its list partly out of frustration at his elusiveness. "These are sophisticated folks who know how to hide themselves on the internet,'' said John Brown, who oversees the FBI's cyber-division. The agency has offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. According to the 2005 indictment, Mr Perez-Melara sold the malware to 1,000 customers, who then used it to infect the computers of about 2,000 victims. Victims took the bait about half the time, the government said. People who bought the spyware were charged with illegally intercepting electronic communications. </body>

      <body>Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's official website has been hacked by people claiming to be members of the hacking group Anonymous. The attack comes a day after Mr Lee said he would track down the group. He made the comments after a person claiming to be part of the group posted an online video in which he threatened to hack government websites. Singapore's internet and phone regulator said part of the website had been "compromised" late on Thursday. "The PMO main website is still working, and we are working to restore the page that has been compromised," the Infocomm Development Authority said in a statement. The hackers had posted an image of a Guy Fawkes mask - the symbol of the Anonymous group - on the PM's website with the words: "It's great to be Singaporean today." Under new rules, unveiled by the Media Development Authority earlier this year, sites "that report regularly on issues relating to Singapore and have significant reach among readers" require individual licences. The video, which was posted last month, had protested against the government's new rules for news websites. Earlier this week, Mr Lee said his government would "spare no effort to try and track down the culprits". "If we can find him, we will bring him to justice and he will be dealt with severely. You may think you're anonymous but we will make that extra effort to find out who you are," he added. Earlier this month, a hacker - dubbed The Messiah and claiming to be a part of Anonymous - hacked the website of Singapore's main paper, The Straits Times. He had left a message saying the paper's report on the video was misleading. According to reports, The Messiah also claimed responsibility for hacking the website of the Ang Mo Kio Town Council last week, the municipal branch of the prime minister's district. Hackers linked to Anonymous have defaced dozens of websites belonging to Australian businesses and Philippine government agencies during the past week. </body>

      <title>Instagram grapples with drug adverts</title>
      <description>Facebook blocks searches for some topics associated with photos used to publicise the illegal sale of drugs via Instagram but leaves others active.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24842750</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70967000/png/_70967218_last3.png</thumbnail>
      <body>Instagram has blocked searches for certain terms associated with the suspected illegal sale of drugs via its service. The photo-themed social network took the measure after being asked to respond to an investigation by #BBCtrending - a new social media series. The journalists had uncovered many pictures and videos of narcotics posted alongside text advertising their sale. Instagram is owned by Facebook. The firm has a policy of acting on posts reported as being inappropriate, but it believes it would be impractical and invasive to search for such material. "Instagram has a clear set of rules about what is and isn't allowed on the site," a spokeswoman told the BBC. "We encourage people who come across illegal or inappropriate content to report it to us using the built-in reporting tools next to every photo, video or comment, so we can take action. "People can't buy things on Instagram, we are simply a place where people share photos and videos." Among Instagram's "report photo/video" choices is the option to identify suspected drug use. The BBC understands Facebook's staff aim to review posts flagged to either of its social networks within 48 hours. They also have the option of blocking terms classed as "bad hashtags" - ones that promote banned activities - if they are mentioned in the press or in user reports. The only content Facebook does actively search for is images of child abuse. Most of the drugs-related activity appears to be taking place in the US. "Just getting a few packs ready for tomorrow morning... Place your order today, it gets shipped out at 8AM tomorrow," read one post placed beneath an image of bags of marijuana. Another picture showed a variety of pills, adding: "$2 a pop for xans, $10 a pop for roxys." This refers to Xanax, a psychoactive anxiety treatment, and Roxicodone, an opiate used to treat pain. Both require prescriptions in the US and the UK, but are sometimes bought on the black market. Crystals of MDMA and other amphetamine-related substances were among other drugs advertised via photos and videos. In many cases the buyer and seller arranged to finalise their deals using WhatsApp or Kik - instant messaging apps in which they could keep messages private. Like Instagram, accounts can be set up on these services without revealing either party's true identity. Instagram is not the only social network on which drugs are advertised. The BBC has also seen instances of the practice in comments below some videos on Google's YouTube service. But while it is relatively common for the person who uploaded a drug-themed photo or video on Instagram to be the one advertising the sale of the substance, on YouTube the person posting the ad tends to do so below videos belonging to others. Like Facebook, Google relies on users reporting a problem before taking action. "We take user safety seriously and have guidelines that prohibit any content encouraging dangerous, illegal activities," said a spokeswoman for YouTube. "This includes content promoting the sale of drugs. YouTube's review teams respond to videos flagged for our attention around the clock, removing millions of videos each year that violate our policies." One drugs abuse researcher - who has advised the UN, World Health Organization and the UK government - said he was concerned by what he had seen. "I'm not particularly sophisticated on the internet, and it took me 10 seconds to see posts selling class-A drugs on Instagram," said Prof Neil McKeganey, founder of the Centre for Drug Misuse Research, in Glasgow. "Here is a public space being used to trade some of the most dangerous substances that we know are being abused. "I absolutely feel there is a responsibility to take proactive action. "It seems to me far too serious for those who own the companies that provide the public space through which this is occurring to simply say it's up to contributors to bring this to their attention." UK-based drugs treatment charity Addaction said it too wanted social media companies to act "swiftly and vigilantly", adding that it believed the companies could make a positive difference if they did. "Social media is a great way of reaching out to millions and millions of people," said spokesman Elliot Elam. "That's why we'd like to see providers of these sites work with organisations like ours, so they can find ways to engage with any users who may be struggling with drug or alcohol problems." Google and Facebook are not the only companies that rely on user reports to indentify potential drugs deals. Yahoo's blogging service Tumblr confirmed it had the same policy. "For legal reasons, we do not proactively monitor the site," said a spokeswoman. "We respond to reports of activity that is illegal or against our policies pursuant to those policies and relevant law." Although the BBC found photos of illegal drugs on Tumblr, searches for the terms that brought up associated adverts on Instagram did not appear to do so on Yahoo's service. This is not the first time Instagram's self-policing policies have been called into question. In August the Fusion.net blog suggested that the illegal psychedelics 2C-I and 2CB were also being advertised via the app. Vice Magazine also highlighted that marijuana and several kinds of prescription pills were promoted on the service. However it suggested that banning related hashtags would not solve the problem, saying "users would get more creative and choose other labels". More recently US senator Edward Markey wrote to the service's chief executive, Kevin Systrom, asking him to look into reports that unregulated gun sales were being conducted through the app. "Other companies that enable online sales have enacted commonsense protocols," he wrote. "I encourage Instagram to take similar steps and adopt safe business practices that curb the marketing and sale of guns." #BBCtrending is a hand-picked selection of stories trending on social media around the world.

      <body>Electric carmaker Tesla's Model S has suffered its third fire in five weeks. In the latest incident, which took place on Wednesday in the US state of Tennessee, a fire broke out in a car after it hit debris on the road. Tesla said the fire did not start spontaneously but was the result of the accident. The previous two fires have also been related to accidents. The firm's shares fell more than 7% on Thursday, after a 14% fall on Wednesday triggered by weak earnings. The company reported that it made a net loss of $38m in the July-to-September period. In the latest incident, the front of a Tesla vehicle burst into flames after it ran over a tow bar near the town of Smyrna, Tennessee. Analysts said that while the fires had been the result of accidents, investors had been worried about any potential impact on the firm. "For a company with a stock price based as much or more on image than financials, those recurring headlines are highly damaging," said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book. Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, added that the risk of a formal investigation by US safety regulators "could raise near-term concerns to a higher level in terms of cost, image and production disruption". Tesla's shares fell 7.5% to close at $139.7 on Thursday. In October, a Model S caught fire after the driver ran over what Tesla said was "an extremely large object" near Seattle, Washington state. After the fire, officials at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had said they found no evidence to indicate that it resulted from defects or violations of US safety standards. The second incident took place in Mexico later in the month. According to reports a car caught fire after it drove through a roundabout, crashed through a concrete wall and hit a tree. Tesla said it is investigating the latest incident in Tennessee to find out what had caused the fire. "Our team is on its way to Tennessee to learn more about what happened in the accident," Tesla spokeswoman Elizabeth Jarvis-Shean said in a statement. "We will provide more information when we're able to do so." The firm's chief executive, Elon Musk, has previously said that electric cars are safer than conventional cars. </body>

      <body>A US company has unveiled build-your-own toy robots that can drive, wiggle and react to the world around them. The modular system, called Moss, uses magnetic balls as joints and hinges, has no external wires, and works without the user having to write any computer code. By attaching a Bluetooth module, players can control the robots remotely using a smartphone or tablet. The system has been developed by Modular Robotics in Boulder, Colorado. The company launched the toys on crowdfunding website Kickstarter. But chief executive and design director Eric Schweikardt told the BBC: "We're already making Moss so we don't need the Kickstarter funding. But in 2013, it seems like the place where people look for cool new tech products." The final version of the robot kits would "begin shipping in January or February", he said. "We're at the very beginning of an exciting time for consumer robotics." Hod Lipson, professor of engineering at Cornell University, New York State, said: "Modular robotics have been around for decades, and we've always believed they could be cheap, robust and versatile. In practice, they've proved to be expensive and fragile. "Modular Robotics is one of the first companies putting in the effort to mass-produce these things." He believes such toys could help make robotics accessible to young children and interest them in engineering from a young age. Although he used to teach Mr Schweikardt, Prof Lipson stressed that he had no financial interest in the company. In October, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology showed off cube-shaped robots that can flip, jump and assemble themselves into different shapes. The small robots, known as M-Blocks, have no external parts but can move using an internal flywheel mechanism and stick together using magnets. </body>

      <title>New invisibility cloak type designed</title>
      <description>A new "broadband" invisibility cloak which hides objects over a much wider range of frequencies has been devised by US scientists.</description>

      <body>A new "broadband" invisibility cloak which hides objects over a wide range of frequencies has been devised. Despite the hype about Harry Potter-style cloaks, our best current designs can only conceal objects at specific wavelengths of light or microwaves. At other frequencies, invisibility cloaks actually make things more visible, not less, US physicists found. Their solution is a new ultrathin, electronic system, which they describe in Physical Review Letters. "Our active cloak is a completely new concept and design, aimed at beating the limits of [current cloaks] and we show that it indeed does," said Prof Andrea Alu, from the University of Texas at Austin. "If you want to make an object transparent at all angles and over broad bandwidths, this is a good solution. "We are looking into realising this technology at the moment, but we are still at the early stages." While the popular image of an invisibility cloak is the magical robe worn by Harry Potter, there is another kind which is not so far-fetched. The first working model - which concealed a small copper cylinder by bending microwaves around it - was first demonstrated in 2006. It was built with a thin shell of metamaterials - artificial composites whose structures allow properties which do not exist in nature. Cloaking materials could have applications in the military, microscopy, biomedical sensing, and energy harvesting devices. The trouble with current designs is they only work at limited bandwidths. Even this "perfect" 3D cloak demonstrated last year could only hide objects from microwaves. At other frequencies the cloak acts as a beacon - making the hidden object more obvious - as Prof Alu and his team have now demonstrated in a new study in Physical Review X. They looked at three popular types of "passive" cloaks - which do not require electricity - a plasmonic cloak, a mantle cloak, and a transformation-optics cloak. All three types scattered more waves than the bare object they were trying to hide - when tested over the whole range of the electromagnetic spectrum. "If you suppress scattering in one range, you need to pay the price, with interest, in some other range," Prof Alu told BBC News. "For example, you might make a cloak that makes an object invisible to red light. But if you were illuminated by white light (containing all colours) you would actually look bright blue, and therefore stand out more." A cloak that allows complete invisibility is "impossible" with current passive designs, the study concluded. "When you add material around an object to cloak it, you can't avoid the fact that you are adding matter, and that this matter still responds to electromagnetic waves," Prof Alu explained. Instead, he said, a much more promising avenue is "active" cloaking technology - designs which rely on electrical power to make objects "vanish". Active cloaks can be thinner and less conspicuous than passive cloaks. Alu's team have proposed a new design which uses amplifiers to coat the surface of the object in an electric current. This ultrathin cloak would hide an object from detection at a frequency range "orders of magnitude broader" than any available passive cloaking technology, they wrote. Prof David Smith of Duke University, one of the team who created the first cloak in 2006, said the new design was one of the most detailed he had yet seen. "It's an interesting implementation but as presented is probably a bit limited to certain types of objects," he told BBC News. "There are limitations even on active materials. It will be interesting to see if it can be experimentally realised." Prof Smith points out that even an "imperfect" invisibility cloak might be perfectly sufficient to build useful devices with real-world applications. For example, a radio-frequency cloak could improve wireless communications - by helping them bypass obstacles and reducing interference from neighbouring antennas. "To most people, making an object 'invisible' means making it transparent to visible wavelengths. And the visible spectrum is a tiny, tiny sliver of the overall electromagnetic spectrum," he told BBC News. "So, this finding does not necessarily preclude the Harry Potter cloak, nor does it preclude any other narrow bandwidth application of cloaking." </body>

      <title>Where is next generation of coders?</title>
      <description>Who will teach our children to code?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24742105</url>
      <date>1384300806</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70980000/jpg/_70980851_70801056.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>These days coders are as in demand as supermodels were in the 1980s. From banks to hospitals to local government, everyone wants a techie on their team. But just as more and more jobs rely on computing and coding, so conversely fewer people have the skills to fill them. To head off a global coding crisis, something needs to be done to persuade youngsters that there is more to coding than dark rooms, pizzas and unsociable hours. For Vikas Gupta, former head of consumer payments at Google, the answer lies in starting them early. "I have a daughter aged two and I wanted to do something for children. I started to wonder at what age children can grasp coding concepts," he told the BBC. Children as young a five are able to grasp coding concepts as long as the learning is done through tangible interactions, according to an MIT study that Mr Gupta came across. "That was eye-opening for me. And there were no products that exist for that age. So I set out to design something that a child younger than 10 can have fun with and learn programming," he said. He came up with Bo and Yana, two robots that aim to teach children about programming without them even realising it. Yana is the smaller robot and can be programmed to make sounds and perform actions. Bo can be programmed to move around and the robots interact with each other. "They can be programmed to play hide-and-seek," said Mr Gupta. Initially children just start by playing a variety of games with the robot, barely aware that they are coding. Once they have got the hang of that, they can move on to use visual programs such as Scratch to create their own code. Both robots are controlled wirelessly via a tablet or smartphone - currently the app is only available for iOS devices. The project is crowdfunded and hit its $250,000 target within three days. The plan is to start selling the robots in the summer of next year. Mr Gupta is also keen to get the robots into schools and is working to develop curriculum resources for them. As part of his research, Mr Gupta was shocked at the state of technology education in the US. "Computer science education has got worse in the last 20 years rather than better," he said. A 2010 report from the Computer Science Teachers Association seems to bear this out. It found that more than two-thirds of US states had little or no computer science standards at secondary school level. There was also "deep and widespread confusion" about what technology education should consist of, whether it be computer literacy or computer science. The report concluded that the US had "fallen woefully behind in preparing students with the fundamental computer science knowledge and skills they need for future success". It could draw some valuable lessons from Estonia. The Eastern European country may only be small - its population is just 1.3 million - but with an envied e-government programme and the birthplace of some big-name tech firms including Skype, it is definitely punching above its weight when it comes to technology. The president - who himself turned his hands to a bit of coding to fund himself through university - is very clear about where he wants to see education go. He has the backing of Education Minister Jaak Aaviksoo, a former physicist, who wants to drag the educational system into the computer age. "It is time for 19th Century educational methods to rise the challenges of the 21st Century," he tells the BBC. As part of that he has introduced coding into the classroom as soon as children start school, aged seven. "Kids are very capable and they are already doing complicated things on their tablets and smartphones. If they are used to that then there shouldn't be a gap when they start school. "School should not be an old-style kind of place but it should build on the potential kids are bringing from home," he adds. Currently the initiative is being tested but Mr Aaviksoo hopes to roll it out to all primary schools in the next five years. And Estonia's radical education plans don't stop with coding for seven-year-olds. In February it announced a partnership with Oxford-based computerbasedmaths.org, a group that aims to radically overhaul the way maths is taught in schools. For British technologist Conrad Wolfram, who founded the group, there is little point in teaching children to make complicated calculations, when they get a computer to do that, and maths should be used more creatively to solve problems that really interest them. While learning times tables and other basic calculations are necessary in the early years, by the time children get to secondary school, he thinks that the emphasis on complex computations is both unnecessary and likely to turn pupils off the subject. "It is not dumbing it down, it is making it harder. It also makes it a lot more fun, more geared towards problems that you might want to solve," he told the BBC. So instead of lessons on quadratic equations, a computer-based maths class would focus on real-world problem-solving, posing questions such as "Am I normal?", "What makes a beautiful shape?" or "Do I need to insure my laptop?" Estonia is testing the system in 30 of its secondary schools. "The idea is to use maths as a tool box to solve problems," said Mr Aaviksoo. He is also considering the idea of letting children bring their own devices to school. "So many have tablets and other things, although there would have to be provision for those that don't," he said. In England and Wales, the ICT curriculum is about to be ripped up and replaced by one that Education Minister Michael Gove hopes will both interest young people more and prepare them better for the computer-dominated world of work. There will be less emphasis on spreadsheets, more hands-on developing and definitely a return to good old-fashioned coding. For his part, Mr Wolfram thinks that Mr Gove's plans need to go a lot further - and he could start by ripping up the current maths curriculum as well. "It's great to have coding back on the agenda but I think that coding should be tied to primary school maths," he said. He doesn't think that such change will happen overnight - in fact he estimates that the changes in the curriculum to reflect the computer age will take 25 years to bed in, but he is hopeful that, in the end, it can create students that are more confident in using the language of coding. </body>

      <title>Brazil at odds over anti-NSA net law</title>
      <description>New internet law causes controversy following NSA leaks</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24899396</url>
      <date>1384214853</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/71055000/jpg/_71055251_apinted.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Along with Russia, China and Iran, Brazil was one of the countries of most interest for US intelligence agencies, according to the leaks from the US National Security Agency (NSA). But whereas those other countries may not have appeared too surprised by the extent of US spying, Brazil was outraged. Documents leaked by the NSA whistleblower, Edward Snowden, indicated that the agency had monitored internal Brazilian government communications, had spied on the state oil company, and had even intercepted data from President Dilma Rousseff's own office. In response, Ms Rousseff cancelled a trip to Washington. In an angry speech at the United Nations General Assembly, she accused the US of breaking international law. "Friendly governments and societies that seek to build a true strategic partnership, as in our case, cannot allow recurring illegal actions to take place as if they were normal," she exclaimed. "They are unacceptable." Together with Germany, Brazil also put forward a resolution calling for an end to excessive electronic surveillance. Customers at the Cyber Gol internet café in Catete, a commercial district near the centre of Rio de Janeiro, overwhelmingly agree with President Rousseff's response. "It's a scandal," Paula Fladel, a 42-year old businesswoman, tells the BBC. "I was outraged at the arrogant, overbearing meddling that the US carries out in practically the whole of the world." Joanne Lima, a 22-year old student, says the US has taken advantage of its technological expertise. "They want to play the part of the world's policeman. Not only in Brazil, but in other countries too," she says. "The Brazilian government must take stronger measures to protect our privacy." In fact, Brazil is considering further action. At the end of October, President Rousseff granted what is termed "constitutional urgency" to new legislation on internet usage. After two years crawling through congress, the Marco Civil da Internet - a civil rights framework for internet users and providers - must now be debated ahead of all other parliamentary business. The bill includes measures to protect users' privacy and right to free speech and would prohibit internet service providers (ISPs) from discriminating between different types of content. But in the rush to respond to her citizens' anger over US data intercepts, the president has insisted on an amendment which critics argue could lead to Brazil ending up with a substandard version of the net. President Rousseff wants all internet companies operating in Brazil to store copies of personal information on their Brazilian clients in the country. By doing so, the firms providing cloud services would become subject to local privacy laws. But the most prominent supporters of the original version of the bill think that not only will the amendment fail to secure individual's data, it will also drive up the costs for companies operating in Brazil, and impede local innovation. Ronaldo Lemos is the director of the Institute of Technology and Society in Rio de Janeiro and one of the architects of the Marco Civil. "This forced local data storage will make internet companies flee from Brazil," he says. "Brazilian internet users will have a second class service compared to Americans or Europeans. "Websites offering services to Brazilians will have to worry about building a data centre in Brazil." Data storage in Brazilian is costly in comparison to both neighbouring countries and the US. Figures from 2012 indicate Brazil has more than 86 million internet users. Social networks are hugely popular in a country where telephone services are still expensive and patchy. The Latin American giant is second only to the US in terms of individual Facebook users. On making a new acquaintance, Brazilians are more likely to invite each other to continue the relationship on "Face" than they are to ask for a phone number. Brazil also boasts the world's second-largest number of Twitter users. With the social media market in the US and Europe close to saturation point, China's internet users limited in their freedoms, and India's digital revolution still in its infancy, Brazil is set to play an increasingly important role in shaping the global rules governing social media users' data. Critics worry that President Rousseff's proposed legislation could set a precedent that other countries, with less regard for freedom of speech, might follow. But Glenn Greenwald, the Brazil-based journalist who reported Edward Snowden's leaked material, says this is a natural reaction to the anger the NSA's activities have provoked. "I think a lot of countries are going to start to look for ways in which they don't have to be dependent on US infrastructure," says the writer who previously reported for the Guardian newspaper. "One of the ways that the NSA currently intercepts people's data is by physically invading their telecommunications systems through using American companies that have access to their systems. "The more means that are cut off for the NSA to be intercepting this data, I think the more secure these systems will become." Given the widespread opposition to the proposal, it is not clear whether it will survive the final draft of the bill, due to be voted on this week. But the government has indicated that if its idea of local data storage does not form part of the Marco Civil, it will seek to draft separate legislation enshrining the proposal in law at a later date. </body>

      <body>Big business wants your voice - not for customer feedback, but to tackle fraud. Voice biometrics - the recording and analysis of unique voiceprints for authentication purposes - is one of the latest technological weapons being deployed in the war against fraudsters, thought to be pilfering at least £52bn from the UK economy each year, according to the National Fraud Authority (NFA). UK financial services companies alone are conservatively estimated to be losing more than £5bn annually, the NFA says. But the real figures are likely to be two or three times higher than this as so much fraud goes unreported. Identity theft and account takeover are a big and growing problem, particularly in a digital era that has been a boon to fraudsters by presenting them with many more ways to harvest personal data. The main advantage of voice is that it is much harder to spoof and steal. "Voice is a dynamic form of biometrics, rather than static like a fingerprint, so it is harder to replicate and copy digitally," says Emmanuelle Filsjean, global head of marketing for ValidSoft, which advises retail banks on security and helps European governments tackle cross-border benefit fraud. Digital voiceprints contain over 100 identifiable elements. And, by using complex mathematical algorithms and the latest high-definition audio equipment, voice biometric companies believe they can now identify people accurately more than 97% of the time. Even identical twins, who share the same DNA, can be told apart from their voiceprints, making the technology reliable enough to be used as evidence in courts of law. Voice is crucial because call centres are still the main way we interact with companies, despite the rise of online banking and shopping. Traditional authentication measures, involving personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords, and "memorable" answers to stock questions, have proved fallible, largely because we are fallible - we keep forgetting them. This is why we choose ludicrously simple PINs and passwords that are easy for us to remember - and therefore for others to guess. Fraud investigators have found that about 10% of four-digit PINs stolen by fraudsters are simply 1-2-3-4, while banks report legitimate customers failing call centre authentication procedures 10% to 20% of the time because they cannot remember their security details. "You can't forget your voice," says Prof Levent Arslan, chief executive of Sestek, a technology company that helped Turkish mobile phone company Avea register one million voiceprints in a year. Your voice is also easy to use. "Using our voice is the most intuitive way of interacting," says Ms Filsjean. While no biometrics security system is totally foolproof, fraudsters using high-definition recordings of someone's telephone pass phrase should still be caught out, voice biometrics companies maintain, because even the highest-quality recordings use some form of compression that blunts the highest and lowest frequencies. Even a slight mismatch with the customer's voiceprint will trigger a "live test" conversation that is almost impossible for fraudsters to spoof, particularly if they've only got a recording to use. Barclays' private banking arm, Barclays Wealth, claims great success after implementing voice biometrics. Before introducing the technology, it found that 25% of fraudulent phone calls to its agents were able to bypass the bank's security systems. Fraudsters using "social engineering" techniques - or blagging in the vernacular - were able to elicit security details from agents. The bank would not disclose how much money was being lost as a result. Barclays says that now the number of successful fraudulent calls is zero, because it uses technology from the company behind Apple iPhone's Siri speech recognition system, Nuance, a leader in the field. The voiceprints of suspected fraudsters are kept on a watchlist so they can be identified if they try again pretending to be someone else. Slovakian Tatra Bank is currently rolling out a voice biometric system that will authenticate customer identities while they are speaking to call centre agents. About 10 to 15 seconds of natural conversation is enough to match the voiceprint with the one the bank has on record. Turkish mobile phone operator, Turkcell, now has about 10 million customer voiceprints on its database. "Most financial institutions and big service providers around the world are actively considering adopting voice biometrics," says Almog Aley-Raz, head of voice biometrics for Nuance. The tricky part is enrolling customers in the scheme, as different jurisdictions have their own privacy laws governing voice recording. "In many cases there is ambiguity around the collection and use of biometrics," says Mr Aley-Raz. "But our best practice recommendation to our customers is to obtain consent for using the technology. "Regardless of whether a given jurisdiction has specific provision for the use of biometrics, biometric data is personal, private, and should be treated with the same care as any other data of that type." Voice biometrics alone is not enough to combat fraud, however. Other technologies, such as communications data analytics, must come into play. 'Profound' All UK financial institutions have had to record phone calls for years, and this has led to gargantuan amounts of data sitting in servers, largely ignored. But now audio and video search software, coupled with sophisticated analytical tools, is making this data mountain much more easily accessible and useful. "The enormously sophisticated technologies that dig into written communication are now being switched to the spoken word," says Richard Newton, co-founder of OP3NVoice, a technology company specialising in searchable audio and video recording. "This has profound implications for fraud detection. Analysis of emotions, stress, sentiment, and meaning is a fast-developing area." What you say, how you say it, when, where and to whom, can all be weighted by algorithms that learn to spot suspicious or anomalous patterns of behaviour. As Glenn Perachio, forensics specialist at accountancy firm Ernst and Young, says: "It's like searching for a hay-coloured needle in a haystack, so you need to adopt techniques, such as machine learning, topic modelling, and geo-spatial mapping, to help narrow down the search for that evidence of malfeasance." Voice biometrics and speech analytics, it seems, are finally striking a true - and productive - note. </body>

      <title>The retreat of free internet content</title>
      <description>Are the days of free-to-read net content numbered?</description>

      <body>Fortune writer Adam Lashinsky seemed stunned and bemused by the blowback from his readers. He had written about the 3G buyout of Heinz on the professional networking site LinkedIn, and added: "Fortune [where I work] published a longish preview of the article here. The full version is here, and you'll have to be a Fortune subscriber to read it. No apologies by the way. The kids say they can get everything they need to read for free on the internet. Sorry. It's not true." Readers erupted. The most "liked" comment, 319 up to the time of publishing, was this: "If your Fortune article is as empty of content as this LinkedIn article, I think I'll stick to the free sources. Please refrain from spam postings." Mr Lashinsky wrote a combative follow-up defending subscription. He was unapologetic. "As far as the readers of my post were concerned, I had committed the cardinal sin of social media, which was to link to an article for which they had to pay", he tells the BBC. "To paraphrase their response, how dare I tell them about something that was not available to them for free." So, are the battle lines being drawn between free and subscription? Tumbling ad revenues and circulation are hitting traditional newspapers hard, making some of them charge for content. "Advertising is weakening on newspaper sites and online sites because you can target the ads through Google and Facebook to individual people," says blogger Andrew Sullivan. He made the one-million-readers-a-month The Dish a standalone blog, taking it out of the Newsweek/Daily Beast site and charging readers $20 (£12.50) a year. "We media have to find another model that does not rely on advertising. It's not actually working financially in the long run," Mr Sullivan says. "Advertising-supported news was a glorious accident," adds Mr Lashinsky. "We need other revenue streams. Subscriptions are a good one." Many readers seem resistant to paying for online content. Some sites have designed metered models that recognise that. The New York Times brings down a pay curtain after 10 free articles a month. The Times, in the UK, makes the start of articles visible, and directs readers wanting to see more to pay to access the rest. The Wall Street Journal and Financial Times have a combination of pay, free and registration content. Some sites have promotions for free or reduced subscriptions, or bundles with other product and services offers. Into the picture has stepped Jeff Bezos, of Amazon, who brings to a historic title, the Washington Post, a dose of modern start-up and retail savvy. Computer science engineer Robert Cailliau is the often unheralded other half of the story of inventing the world wide web, alongside Sir Tim Berners-Lee. The web was initially a system to connect the world's universities, which did not have a simple way of accessing each other's remotely stored academic papers and documents. Mr Cailliau, a Belgian, is now retired from Cern (the European Organisation for Nuclear Research in Geneva) and lives in France. He says that the idea of "dealing with the value of information" has been around for 20 years. "It was impossible for someone to say, 'I worked very hard to put up this information to keep these articles up to date… I want you to pay me, say one cent every time you click on one of my pages.'" Mr Cailliau thinks that monthly subscriptions are too expensive and restrictive. He says the pay-as-you-go mobile phone model is a great one for online content. "When you send an SMS, you pay a small amount of money. Each individual action should be billed individually," he says. "My browser should pay you automatically a cent or two cents per page without me feeling it. I should not have to prepay a large amount of money." "Why re-invent? The telephone already does that. We already have a worldwide system that's capable of billing the customer for every move he makes." Tien Tzuo is chief executive of Zuora, a San Francisco subscription management company. Its clients include News International - parent company of the Times - and Fairfax, owners of some of the largest titles in Australia. "Two cents a view is one possible model, but not necessarily the best," he says. "Your wireless plan now has prepaid plans, post-paid plans, family plans, nights and weekend plans, unlimited plans, bundles. "And people actually do not like feeling metered, they don't like being on a phone call and feeling like they have to get off the phone." What does he think his fellow West Coast entrepreneur Mr Bezos brings to the newspaper business? "People forget that Amazon built warehouses and distribution centres - a bricks and mortars operation to go with the internet side," he answers. "For newspapers, some people still want the printed product on their commute on the bus or the train. "On weekends at the kitchen table, people like to spread out the Sunday papers, and take out their favourite section." Can online media survive without subscriptions? "No," says Mr Tzuo firmly. "For freemium models like Evernote and Dropbox, there's enormous value in the free product, but eventually you need customers to pay. That's the best economic foundation for your organisation. "The gravy train is over. There is no more advertising subsidies that can power newspapers." Digital platforms cost money to build, but we still get much of our online content for free. That may be changing, but the question of the most effective way of balancing reader browsing habits with businesses' need to be viable, is far from settled. </body>

      <title>Bringing more women to the Valley</title>
      <description>Google's advertising chief discusses how to have more women in Silicon Valley</description>

      <body>From Twitter lacking a single female on its board to sexist prank apps at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco, the past few weeks have seen increased debate about the discrimination faced by women in Silicon Valley. The BBC World Service's Newshour gathered a range of women from the world's centre of technological innovation to ask: why aren't there more women in Silicon Valley? While being one of the most high profile women in Silicon Valley, Google's advertising chief Susan Wojcicki frequently sees the challenges women face in technology. Problems can often start before even reaching the workplace. She noticed that her son was taking over access to technology at home, and shutting off his sister. "My son, I realised, had basically monopolised the computer at home," she says. "My daughter had just given up and let him have it all the time and didn't think computers were that interesting." She tried to remedy this by sending her daughter to a technology-focused summer camp. However, her daughter came back complaining that there were too many boys. "I realise how easy it is for us just to let the girls kind of slip away," she says. Only a fifth of computer science graduates in the USA are female. Ms Wojcicki argues that we need women in technology if only to build better products. She cites studies which show that diverse teams come up with better products, and that as consumers of tech, women should also be more involved in creating these products in the first place. "We just bring different experiences to the table," she says. Furthermore, the growing dominance of tech means that in the near future most aspects of life will involve a technological element. Computer scientist Dr Telle Whitney agrees. She runs the Anita Borg Institute, a group which promotes gender diversity in Silicon Valley. She believes that computing knowledge is required to help solve many of our problems, from climate change to online education. "If you want to change the future, you want to be part of computing," Dr Whitney says. However, the issue isn't just that there aren't enough women going into tech. Women in the technology sector also drop out fast. Dr Whitney says women leave the industry twice as much as men. "They are just uncomfortable," she explains. Dr Whitney says there is a lot of unconscious sexism and the long hours also make it hard for women with families. Some women believe that Silicon Valley's very strengths can also give rise to a culture of discrimination persisting. "Silicon Valley is incredibly invested in its self-image as a meritocracy," says Basho's director of product management and blogger Shanley Kane, explaining the belief that anyone can make it with intelligence and hard work. "That very belief prevents us from actually critically examining the culture," she says. Furthermore, Ms Kane warns that certain men in the community make it hard for women to speak out, so many women simply don't. She points to the rise of the 'brogrammer' culture over the past five years - a type of young male programmer said to exhibit loud and brash behaviour. Ms Kane believes this move away from the stereotype of the reserved geek and towards a new hyper-masculine personality is an effort by some men to reclaim power. "We have an extremely aggressive, hyper-sexual, hyper-masculine stereotype of the geek that's starting to take over," she warns, "and that's extremely threatening to women." Women who do speak up, such as herself, can face harsh criticism. She believes this environment silences debate. "The overwhelming voice of women in technology about patriarchy and about oppression and about the problems we have is actually silence," she says. "Most women don't talk about it." "Silence is the default mode." The scrutiny women can face also leads some to feel under pressure to perform well at all times, or risk being dismissed for their gender. Kristen Pownell is a 19-year-old electrical engineering student at Stanford University. "This year I'm starting my electrical engineering core classes and when I walked into class on the first day I was shocked," Miss Pownell says. "My class is 50 people and there's three or four or maybe five girls there," she says. "It's really noticeable." She finds it intimidating being one of a handful of women and feels under pressure to prove herself. "I have this irrational fear that I'm representing all women everywhere and I need to prove myself in order to maintain femininity," she says. She believes support groups are valuable and make women feel less isolated, and she does outreach to girls in high schools, encouraging them to study science and technology. Perhaps the best way to address the problems women face is for more women to enter the industry. Ms Wojcicki is trying to encourage more women into tech and says there is a place for them. The tech world is creative and team orientated, she says, and enables people to build products which will be used around the world. By being part of the tech world she says they can also change the industry's culture. "If those girls all decide to come into this industry, they can change it," she says. "They can make it different and they can make it be for them in the way they want it to be." </body>

      <body>Instagram, the photo and video sharing network owned by Facebook, is usually associated with light-hearted 'selfie' photos, or amusing memes. But it also has a darker side, and has become a marketplace for a wide range of illicit goods. So long as you know the right hashtags to search. Thousands of pictures showing drugs on offer can be found on Instagram by searching keywords. In response to this investigation by #BBCTrending, Instagram has blocked searches for certain terms associated with the suspected illegal sale of drugs via its service. "Instagram has a clear set of rules about what is and isn't allowed on the site," a spokeswoman told the BBC. "We encourage people who come across illegal or inappropriate content to report it to us using the built-in reporting tools next to every photo, video or comments, so we can take action." "People can't buy things on Instagram, we are simply a place where people share photos and videos." BBC Trending is a hand-picked selection of stories trending on social media around the world.

      <title>Twitter: It's worth how much?!</title>
      <description>How do you value a company like Twitter?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24819238</url>
      <date>1383782700</date>

      <body>Twitter's much-anticipated launch on to the markets is fizzing with fanfare and debate over how - given that it has never made money - the microblogging site, priced at $26 per share, is officially worth more than $18bn (£11bn). The facts seem to contradict themselves. Twitter's growth is slow, and it shows no sign of making a profit - its losses for the third quarter of 2013 increased to $64.6m, from $21.6m a year earlier. And more than half of its total registered users don't even use it. But some analysts predict that in the months post-share sale, the seven-year-old company's worth will increase to $20bn and beyond. That would give Twitter a valuation of more than double the likes of global carmaker Fiat, with its very modest-sounding market capitalisation of 6.9bn euros ($9.3bn). But Twitter is not alone in its sector when it comes to big price tags, if not profits. Online "scrapbooking" website Pinterest was valued at $3.8bn in October after its latest round of investment, giving it the same value, in terms of market capitalisation, as the UK's second largest house-builder Barratt Homes. Yet while Barratt has reported a full-year pre-tax profit of £192m for 2012-13, Pinterest has never made any money. Its digital "pinboards" may be attracting users, there may be talk of advertisers paying for posts, but it has no revenue yet. So why do these social media companies have this value attached to them? Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, told the BBC it was a bit like buying a house. "You look at what other people are paying for something a little bit like what you are buying," he said. "[But] you have to think about whether you are going to price [the company] or value it." Twitter, Mr Damodaran believes, is being priced by bankers and brokers - not valued - and that pricing is coming from comparing it to its peers. By this he means that value is something more complex and emotional, but that pricing is based on at-the-time comparisons. Most notably, with Facebook. "The big difference between Facebook and Twitter is that Facebook was making money [when it launched its IPO in 2012] and Twitter is losing money," said Mr Damodaran. Facebook had a billion active users when it launched its shares. While Twitter is growing its user base rapidly - up 39% over the past year to 500 million - only 232 million of these are active each month. According to a recent report by analysts Pew Internet, 72% of internet users in the US use social networking sites, but just 18% use Twitter. Plus, while users are invited to tweet their thoughts in 140 characters, many do not engage on the platform at all, leaving their registered accounts dormant. Others prefer to simply follow news feeds and favourite celebrities instead. This can cut the amount of time people spend on the site, and in turn the opportunities for advertisers to catch their attention. Facebook's IPO famously ran far from smoothly, and its shares quickly halved in price, before recovering slowly over the next two years. "Twitter is also entering a more crowded market than Facebook," said Mr Damodaran, "and there are many more queuing up to join." Therefore, he added, Twitter should be valued at about $10-15bn. He wrote recently that "at $20 billion, it is a moon shot". Chris Orndorff, who manages billions of dollars for clients at Los Angeles-based Western Asset Management, believes value is a lot to do with cash flow. "One of the best ways to value a company is to figure out the present value of the cash flows," he said. "For a more mature company, this is easier to do because they have a history of earnings, and generally reliable predictions about future earnings and cash flows. "Relatively new companies do not have the history." Therefore, he added, the stock was more likely to be volatile. "The susceptibility of social media companies to changes in consumer tastes also makes valuing those companies much more challenging," he said. Martha Lane Fox, co-founder of the travel website Lastminute.com, told the BBC she was confident Twitter could make money and hold its value. "Yes it is a scrabble for revenue," she said, but the company "has an astonishing amount of money in the bank". Advertising income from mobiles, rather than desktop computers, now accounts for over 70% of advertising revenue, and here, believes Ms Lane Fox and others, Twitter may be able to flourish. She also predicted "a huge number of interesting deals and partnerships" that could boost it further. A lot of the "value" or pricing of these companies depends on a future demand for services, as well as possible advertising streams. But, as past deals demonstrate - that future isn't always predictable. Famously, ITV bought the website Friends Reunited for £175m in 2005, but in 2009 Brightsolid paid ITV just £25m for the site. It had been superseded. Its "value" had been eroded. Its customers, the key to any company, had, in large numbers, moved on. Similar problems were encountered at one of the early social media pioneers, MySpace. In 2005 News Corp purchased MySpace for $580m. When it was sold in 2011, its price tag had fallen to a reported $35m. It too had been overtaken, and users abandoned its offering. But, for San Francisco-based CBS technology analyst Larry Magid, these cautionary tales make the newer clutch of technology companies stronger. "MySpace is a constant reminder that a high and mighty service can lose its lustre. However, the lessons of MySpace were not lost on Facebook, Twitter and services that followed," he said. "I think the difference [now] is the execution and the demographics. To succeed, Twitter needs a diversified audience that transcends a particular demographic. MySpace was focused on youth - a particularly fickle audience." Mr Damodaran said: "A lot of very valuable companies today - including Google - were once small, money-losing companies." And Mr Orndorff agreed: "The valuation is reasonable if the company can continue to grow its user base, generate cash flow from advertising, and successfully fend off the competition. If not, then it will be remembered - or forgotten - like many of the 1998-99 tech bubble companies, and generate plenty of tax losses for investors." </body>
