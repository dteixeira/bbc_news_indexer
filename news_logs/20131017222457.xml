      <body>The man being investigated by Norwegian police over the attack on Kenya's Westgate shopping centre is Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, BBC Newsnight has learned. The 23-year-old Norwegian citizen of Somali origin is suspected of helping to plan and carry out the attack. BBC Newsnight has spoken to a relative of his in Norway who said he left the town of Larvik for Somalia in 2009. At least 67 people died in the attack in Nairobi, which the al-Qaeda linked group al-Shabab says it carried out. Last week Norway's intelligence agency, the PST, said it had sent officers to Kenya to verify reports that a Norwegian citizen had been involved in the assault on the shopping centre, which began on Saturday 21 September and lasted four days. It is unclear how many militants were involved. Police had initially estimated that there were 10-15 attackers inside the complex, but the CCTV footage which has so far been released by the Kenyan authorities shows just four men. Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow is believed to be one of those four, the BBC's Newsnight programme has learned from sources in Kenya and Norway. Dhuhulow was born in Somalia, but he and his family moved to Norway as refugees in 1999. One relative, who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity, said that Dhuhulow left for Somalia in 2009. He made infrequent, increasingly erratic, phone calls to the family, they said, the last one coming in the summer when he said that he was in trouble and wanted to return home. On being shown the CCTV footage of the Kenya attackers by Newsnight, Dhuhulow's relative said: "I don't know what I feel or think... If it is him, he must have been brainwashed." Reporting for Newsnight, Gabriel Gatehouse travelled to the coastal town of Larvik, 120 km (75 miles) south of Oslo, where Dhuhulow's family made their home. Morten Henriksen, one of the family's former neighbours, has not seen Dhuhulow for years. "He was pretty extreme, didn't like life in Norway… got into trouble, fights, his father was worried," Mr Henriksen said of Dhuhulow as a teenager. When shown the CCTV footage of the four Kenya attackers he said that the one dressed in a black shirt or jacket could be Dhuhulow. Stig Hansen, an expert on security and political Islam based in Norway, told Newsnight said that he was not surprised to learn that a Norwegian citizen was suspected of taking part in the attack. He said that an estimated 20-30 Norwegians had gone to Somalia to sign up as fighters for the Islamist militant group al-Shabab. "The biggest problem is the so-called 'Generation 1.5', those who weren't born in Norway, but came when they were quite young, falling between two cultures," he said. "[Al-Shabab] need people who are quite ignorant about Somalia. That is in their interest because that will give them a more internationalist agenda. And it might also make them more dangerous when they return back to their home countries," he added. There have been reports that a Kenyan al-Shabab leader whom US commandos targeted in a raid in Somalia on 5 October, but failed to capture, may have spent time in Norway. Norway's TV2 reported that Abdukadir Mohamed Abdukadir, also known as Ikrima, had travelled to Norway and applied for asylum in 2004 but left in 2008 before there was a decision on his application. Norwegian officials have not commented on the claims. Watch the full report in Newsnight on BBC Two at 22:30 BST on Thursday 17 October and on BBC iPlayer (UK only) </body>

      <title>US government heads back to work</title>
      <description>US government employees are back at work after President Obama signed a law ending a government shutdown and raising the US debt limit.</description>

      <body>Hundreds of thousands of US government employees are back at work after President Barack Obama signed a law ending a 16-day government shutdown and extending the US debt limit. The cross-party deal came hours before the US government risked running out of money to pay its bills. "There are no winners," Mr Obama said, adding the US would "bounce back". The deal followed 16 days of partial government shutdown, which began when Congress failed to agree on a budget. Congress voted through the deal less hours before a deadline to raise the $16.7tn (£10.5tn) debt limit. The measure approved in Washington funds the government to 15 January, and extends the US Treasury's borrowing authority until 7 February. The deal does not resolve the budgetary issues that fiercely divide Republicans and Democrats. Instead, it establishes a cross-party committee of legislators tasked with crafting a long-term budget deal and reporting back to Congress by mid-December. A faction of Republicans in the hardline Tea Party movement had pushed for the confrontation as a way to gut Mr Obama's healthcare reform. However, Mr Obama and the Democrats refused to negotiate, and the law commonly known as Obamacare escaped relatively unscathed. On Thursday, Mr Obama thanked congressional leaders for their help ending the government shutdown and raising the debt limit, but said both had "inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy". "Nothing has done more to undermine our economy the last three years than the kind of tactics that create these kinds of manufactured crises," he said. Mr Obama said politicians had to stop listening to "talking heads" and activists "who profit from conflict" and instead focus on growing the economy and creating a responsible budget. "The American people are completely fed up with Washington," he said. "How business is done in this town has to change." Mr Obama called the political crises "a spectacle" which had hurt America's credibility in the world. And to the conservative Republicans who pushed the showdown as a way to extract policy concessions, he said: "Go out there and win an election." Politicians, bankers and economists had warned of global economic calamity unless an agreement to raise the US government's borrowing limit were reached. IMF head Christine Lagarde's positive response to the news was tempered by a call for further action. "It will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner," she said in a statement. Economists have estimated the shutdown cost the US economy billions of dollars. The shutdown affected Americans and visitors to the US in countless ways: most national parks were closed, medical research ground to a halt, and ordinary paperwork went unfinished, delaying visa applications, business permits and safety inspections. Hundreds of thousands of employees were put on leave without pay during the shutdown, with many forced to delay purchases or even payment of routine bills. A few days into the shutdown Congress passed a law ensuring they would receive back pay. Before dawn on Thursday, the US Office of Personnel Management, which manages the federal workforce, announced in a terse statement on its website that government workers should return to work as regularly scheduled. A senior manager at the Department of the Interior, which oversees the national parks system and other public land, reminded employees to disable "out of office" email messages, change voicemail prompts, and "check on any refrigerators and throw out any perished food". "We appreciate your sacrifices through these difficult times and we understand that the lapse in government activities has imposed hardships on you, your families, and the people we serve," Rhea Suh, assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, wrote. Federal workers returning to the downtown Washington DC office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were greeted by Vice-President Joe Biden and a welcome note from their boss, agency head Gina McCarthy. A security officer at the building said the shutdown had been "depressing" and had made her realise how much she enjoyed her job. "I enjoy checking in 500 people every day," said Ettereteen Welch. Spurred on by hardline conservatives, congressional Republicans forced the stand-off by linking budget measures to healthcare reform. Despite reluctant support from the House Republican leadership for the bill approved on Wednesday, most of the party's lawmakers in the House voted against it. Republican Congressman Mo Brooks told the Associated Press news agency the law that ended the shutdown merely delayed the fight. "We need to get to the underlying cause of the problem, which is our out-of-control spending and deficits," he said, "and fix it before it's too late and we go down the toilet to bankruptcy. Because that's where America is headed." </body>

      <description>Eleven Nobel laureates urge Russian President Vladimir Putin to drop piracy charges against 30 Greenpeace activists and journalists.</description>

      <body>Eleven Nobel prize-winners have written to Vladimir Putin asking the Russian president to drop charges against 30 Greenpeace activists and journalists. The 30, who come from 18 nations, were held last month during a protest against oil drilling in the Arctic. The signatories - including Archbishop Desmond Tutu - described the charges of piracy as "excessive". But Mr Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, responded that the president had no power to influence the courts. The Greenpeace activists, who complain of being detained in harsh conditions, face up to 15 years in prison if convicted. So far all bail applications in the case have been refused. The Netherlands has launched legal action to try to free the activists and the ship, and more than 1.4m people have joined a Greenpeace campaign demanding their release. In the letter, which was released by Greenpeace, the laureates urge Mr Putin "to do all you can to ensure that the excessive charges of piracy against the 28 Greenpeace activists, freelance photographer and freelance videographer are dropped, and that any charges brought are consistent with international and Russian law. "We were heartened by your statement, on September 25th, that you did not believe the Greenpeace crew members were pirates," the letter goes on to say. "As you know, the Greenpeace activists were unarmed and used only peaceful means to demonstrate their opposition to the oil drilling operations threatening the Arctic. "Arctic oil drilling is a dangerous, high-risk enterprise. An oil spill under these icy waters would have a catastrophic impact on one of the most pristine, unique and beautiful landscapes on earth," the letter continues. It is also signed by former East Timor President Jose Ramos Horta, Northern Irish peace campaigner Betty Williams, and Iranian human rights activist Shirin Ebadi. But Putin spokesman Mr Peskov said the laureates had addressed their appeal to the wrong person, reported Russian news agency RIA Novosti. "The president treats Nobel prize winners and their opinions with great respect and attention. But in this case, the president is a wrong addressee," the agency quoted him as saying. He said President Putin could not file or drop charges. "Investigative bodies deal with it, and everyone should wait for the end of the investigation process and the court's verdict. "A law is a law," he added. </body>

      <body>At least 48 people have been killed in a series of bomb blasts across Iraq, with dozens more injured. At least 30 people were killed in various areas of Baghdad as Iraqis were celebrating the Eid al-Adha holiday. Earlier a suicide bomb in Mwafaqiya, a village inhabited by the Shabak minority near the northern city of Mosul, killed at least 15 . No group has said it carried out the attacks, which come as violence in Iraq reaches its highest level since 2008. Correspondents say the failure of the Shia-led government to address the grievances of Iraq's Sunni Arab minority - which complains of being excluded from government jobs and senior posts and of abuses by security forces - has driven the surge in unrest. Car bomb attacks took place across Baghdad province after sunset, as families were heading for parks and restaurants, police said. Attacks took place in several mainly Shia areas, including New Baghdad in the south-east, Sadr City in the east, and Husseiniyah. The authorities said three people also died in the mainly Sunni neighbourhood of Shurta, when a car exploded in a commercial area. In northern Iraq, police said three people were killed in a suicide attack inside a cafe in Tuz Khormato, about 200km (125 miles) north of Baghdad. But the biggest attack took place in Mwafaqiya, in Nineveh province, where 15 died and at least 52 were wounded. The region, near the Syrian border, has a large Sunni population and sizeable ethnic minorities, including the Shabak, and al-Qaeda is active in the area. The UN envoy to Iraq, Nickolay Mladenov, condemned the attack on the Shabak community, who largely follow a faith considered an offshoot of Shia Islam. In a statement he called for an end to the violence. "The recent rise in violence in the Nineveh province calls for urgent action and strengthened security cooperation" between the central government and local officials, as well as with authorities in the Kurdish autonomous region that borders Nineveh, Mr Mladenov said. Last month, a suicide bomb attack on a Shabak funeral in Nineveh killed more than 20 people. It is part of a surge in sectarian attacks as Iraq experiences levels of violence not seen since 2008. According to the monitoring group, Iraq Body Count, more than 6,000 people have been killed in acts of violence in the country this year. Almost 1,000 people were killed and more than 2,000 wounded in September alone, the UN says, making it one of the highest monthly death tolls for years. </body>

      <title>Grand coalition beckons in Germany</title>

      <body>A grand coalition between Germany's centre-right and centre-left parties has moved a step nearer, nearly a month after the general election. The leaders of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) have agreed on formal negotiations. They reached agreement at a third round of exploratory talks in Berlin. CDU leaders seem to have softened their opposition to a national minimum wage, a concession to the SPD. Some of the negotiating will be over who gets which ministry, the BBC's Steve Evans reports from the German capital. If the SPD take charge of finance, the departure of current minister Wolfgang Schaeuble may mean a softening of German economic policy. Forming a new German government can be a long and difficult process but all the signs now point to a grand coalition, our correspondent says. The CDU, along with its Bavarian sister party the CSU, fell just short of an outright majority at the polls on 22 September. The CDU/CSU took about 41.5% of the vote, the SPD won 26%, the former communist Left Party 8.6% and the Greens 8.4%. Germany is the EU's most populous country and has its biggest economy, making it a pivotal member of the eurozone. "At the end of the third round of exploratory talks we are convinced that we can find sensible solutions for both sides, and most of all for the country, even on disputed questions," SPD chairman Sigmar Gabriel said. "The conservatives know... that a nationwide minimum wage of 8.5 euros [£7.2; $11.5]... is one of the central tasks and without this a coalition would not make sense for the SPD. That was no big surprise for the CDU/CSU." CDU secretary general Hermann Groehe said: "We have a joint goal of seeing a sensible minimum wage ruling - I am sure we will find a result but we didn't discuss it today." "In the three exploratory sessions it became clear that with regards to identifying the most pressing political tasks facing Germany over the next four years and how to deal with these, we can find enough common ground to rule this country successfully," he said. The chairman of the CSU, Horst Seehofer, said the paramount issue for him remained "no tax increases and no new debt", according to the Munich daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung. Mrs Merkel's previous coalition ally, the Free Democrats, failed to win any seats so the two-term chancellor set about seeking a new partner. Talks with the Greens ended in failure on Wednesday and both of the big parties have ruled out a coalition with the Left Party. As well as the proposed minimum wage, taxation will also be a key issue for the talks. The SPD has not won an election since 2002 and it joined a previous grand coalition under Mrs Merkel in 2005. One final hurdle for the coalition deal will be a vote by SPD party members, promised by the party leadership, on whether to endorse it. </body>

      <title>Inspectors hail progress in Syria</title>
      <description>Chemical weapons inspectors say they are making good progress in Syria, having completed nearly 50% of their work.</description>

      <body>Chemical weapons inspectors in Syria say they have completed nearly half of their work in the country. A spokesman for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical weapons (OPCW) said the team was making good progress in its mission to inspect more than than 20 sites. However he said security remained a concern for the 60 inspectors - who have been in Syria since 1 October. "A few" sites remained inaccessible to the team for security reasons, he said. The OPCW's mission to rid Syria of chemical weapons was set up by a UN resolution. It followed international outrage at a chemical weapons attack near the Syrian capital Damascus in August. The organisation's work in Syria marks the first time the international chemical weapons watchdog - which won this year's Nobel Peace Prize - has been asked to oversee the destruction of a weapons armoury during a conflict. The OPCW, which is based in The Hague, said the team in Syria had completed nearly 50% of their work of inspecting sites and destroying equipment. Under the UN resolution, Syria's chemical weapons production equipment must be destroyed by 1 November and stockpiles must be disposed of by mid-2014. The deadline for Syria to submit its "destruction plan" was 15 November, the OPCW said on Thursday. OPCW spokesman Michael Luhan told the BBC that there had been a number of security incidents over the last few days which had given the inspectors "cause for concern". On Wednesday night there had been a mortar attack near the hotel the inspectors are staying in Damascus and over the weekend a number of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were detonated in cars nearby, he said. Meanwhile, Syrian state TV reports that a Canadian United Nations worker, missing since February, has been released in Damascus. Carl Campeau had been working as a legal adviser to the UN Disengagement Observer Force that patrols the ceasefire line between Syria and Israel in the Golan Heights. The Syrian government says the Canadian was kidnapped by rebels but has now been handed over to a UN representative. An international conference on a political solution to Syria's conflict could take place in Geneva on 23-24 November, Qadri Jamil, Syria's deputy prime minister, said on Thursday. He made the announcement after talks at the foreign ministry in Russia, Syria's main international ally. More than 100,000 people have been killed in the fighting that has ravaged Syria for two-and-a-half years, according to the UN. More than two million people have fled Syria and some 4.5 million have been forced from their homes within the country. Casualty figures vary for the chemical weapons attack on the Ghouta agricultural belt around Syria's capital, Damascus, on 21 August. It was estimated to have killed hundreds of people. The United States and other Western powers blamed the attack on President Bashar al-Assad's forces. But Mr Assad accuses Syrian rebels of being behind it. </body>

      <body>An appeal court in Tunisia has acquitted rapper Ahmed Ben Ahmed, known as Klay BBJ, on charges of insulting the authorities in his songs. The rapper was jailed in September for six months for insulting the police at a concert in the resort of Hammamet. "The court has decided to reject the accusations," the AFP news agency quotes the judge as saying. During the performance in August, he sang alongside fellow rapper Weld El 15, who has been on the run since then. They had both initially been sentenced in absentia in August to 21 months in prison. Klay BBJ lost an appeal in September and was immediately jailed. But on his second appeal hearing in Grombalia, south of the capital, Tunis, the judge said his sentenced had been annulled and he was released. Weld El 15, whose real name is Ala Yaacoub, has been in trouble before for his song The Police Are Dogs. He was given a two-year sentence in June, which was later suspended but he went into hiding following his latest conviction in August. Since the 2011 revolution, which toppled long-time President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, there have been tensions between secular Tunisians and Islamists. "Our songs criticise the current situation in Tunisia and the government, no more and no less," AFP news agency quoted Klay BBJ as saying in September. A coalition led by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party has been in government since elections in 2011. </body>

      <body>Venezuelan rescue teams have retrieved the remains of Italian fashion heir Vittorio Missoni and four other people who died in a plane crash in January. The small plane carrying six passengers plunged into the Caribbean shortly after taking off from the Los Roques islands. It was located in June some 70m (230ft) under the water, north of the Venezuelan archipelago. An investigation is underway to establish the causes of the accident. The bodies retrieved were those of Mr Missoni and his wife, Maurizia Castiglioni; two Italian friends who were holidaying with them in Los Roques, Guido Foresti and Elda Scalvenzi; and Venezuelan co-pilot Juan Carlos Ferrer. They were flown to a morgue in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas. Mr Missoni was the son of Ottavio Missoni, founder of the Italian Missoni fashion house, and co-owned the firm with his siblings. Relatives are due to arrive in Venezuela tonight. Rescue teams have been trying to recover the remains of the sixth victim: Venezuelan pilot German Marchant. Following the twin engine aircraft's disappearance on 4 January, investigators from the Italian Agency for Air Safety (ANSV) said the company that owned the small plane was not fully licensed to operate. A piece of luggage from the aircraft was found off the Dutch island of Curacao, about 320km (200 miles) west of Los Roques, later that month. Los Roques, an archipelago made up of dozens of islands some 95 miles (150km) off Venezuela's coast, is one of the area's most popular holiday destinations. </body>

      <description>Thousands of schoolchildren in Paris and other parts of France demonstrate in anger over the controversial expulsion of two foreign teenagers.</description>

      <body>Thousands of schoolchildren in Paris and other parts of France have been demonstrating in anger over the expulsion of two foreign teenagers. Twenty secondary schools in the French capital were disrupted as children joined a march, clenching fists in solidarity with the expelled pupils. Some demanded the sacking of Interior Minister Manuel Valls. In one case, a Roma schoolgirl was sent to Kosovo and in the other, a student was repatriated to Armenia. There has been widespread indignation at the manner in which border police picked up schoolgirl Leonarda Dibrani, whose family had lost its bid for asylum in France after five years in the country. Leonarda, 15, was escorted from her school bus by a teacher, in front of other children, in the eastern region of Doubs on 9 October. The row has caused strains within the government of Socialist President Francois Hollande, whose most popular minister with the wider public is Mr Valls, according to opinion polls. Mr Valls has drawn protests over his hard line on Roma immigrants. Meanwhile, it has been suggested that only the father of the Dibrani girl is actually from Kosovo and that he lied about his family's origin in his bid to win asylum in France. Schoolchildren left class to show solidarity both with Leonarda and Khatchik Kachatryan, a 19-year-old student in Paris who was expelled on Saturday to Armenia. Mr Kachatryan was arrested for shoplifting in September, at which point police discovered he had entered France illegally, the French daily Le Figaro reports. Reports suggest that he was detained on his return to the former Soviet republic for seeking to escape doing military service. "Bring back Khatchik and Leonarda, they belong here," marching pupils chanted on Thursday, holding up signs calling for Mr Valls to resign. The president of France's National High School Students' Union, Ivan Dementhon, said students were angry at the way the Dibrani family had been treated. "The expulsion of the young Leonarda is particularly shocking because it was done in a school environment," he said. "It's not tolerable that students with or without documents are expelled. Everybody should have a right to education, and that is why all high school students are here." Journalists who visited the Dibrani family in Kosovo on Wednesday found them living in a house in the northern town of Mitrovica, despite earlier suggestions that they were homeless. It has also emerged that the father, Resat, was investigated by French authorities for allegedly beating his family. Resat was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying he was the only member of the family actually born in Kosovo, which he reportedly left in the early 1970s. Leonarda and all the other members were born in Italy, he told the agency. "Then we came to France. We lied to the authorities when we said we were from Kosovo." The family has been lodged in a Mitrovica with a monthly grant of 150 euros (£127; $203) from the Kosovan government, an official told Reuters, speaking anonymously. The official added that the authorities were unsure what to do about them because only the father was from Kosovo. Mr Valls insists that the deportation of Leonarda and the rest of her family was carried out in line with established procedure. "Any immigration policy requires respect for the law, respect for individuals and great firmness," he said this week. Amnesty International recently reported that more than 10,000 Roma had been evicted from temporary camps in France in the first half of the year. Some 20,000 Roma have settled in France, coming mainly from Romania, Bulgaria and parts of the former Yugoslavia like Kosovo. </body>

      <body>Human rights groups and Green Party MEPs have sharply criticised Europe's top human rights watchdog, the Council of Europe, for its mild verdict on Azerbaijan's presidential election. A delegation of European MPs observed the 9 October vote on behalf of the Council of Europe and declared it "free, fair and transparent". But a separate report by international observers said the election was marred by abuses such as ballot-stuffing. The Azeri president won by a landslide. President Ilham Aliyev was re-elected for a third five-year term in the oil-rich former Soviet republic in the Caucasus. He took over in 2003 on the death of his father Heydar, who in turn had ruled since 1993. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) sent a 45-strong observer team, who issued a joint statement with seven members of the European Parliament (MEPs) on 10 October. They said that "overall around election day we have observed a free, fair and transparent electoral process". They called the electoral arrangements "professional and peaceful" and said they had found no evidence of intimidation of voters. However, they also said "improvements are still desirable" and "freedom of expression remains a serious concern". PACE is a grouping of parliamentarians from the Council of Europe's 47 member states. It says its mission is to uphold Europe's "shared values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law". Azerbaijan will take over the rotating chairmanship of the Council of Europe in May 2014. It has been a member of the council since 2000. Election monitors from a different international watchdog, the OSCE, reported "significant problems" in Azerbaijan's voting and counting procedures. The OSCE said it found "clear indications of ballot box stuffing in 37 polling stations, and the counting was assessed negatively in an unprecedented 58 per cent of the stations observed". The US government agreed with the OSCE's concerns and said the election "fell short of international standards". It noted "a repressive political environment" during the campaign, with "routine" official interference in the media and civil society. The OSCE verdict angered Azeri officials - the country's central electoral commission called it "biased" and said Azerbaijan should "reassess future co-operation" with the OSCE. There was no such Azeri threat over the PACE/European Parliament verdict. Tural Ahmedzade, an Azerbaijan researcher at Amnesty International, told the BBC that PACE was "not really pushing the Azeri government enough to address human rights concerns which we have expressed quite often. "PACE should be taking human rights issues more seriously and really put more pressure on Azerbaijan to comply with its Council of Europe obligations," he said. Green Party MEPs called the PACE/European Parliament statement on the election "a sham". The Green foreign affairs spokesperson Werner Schulz said "the shortcomings of EP's own election observation mission to Azerbaijan call into question the existence of such short-term missions in general. "The European Parliament loses credibility with statements ignoring the reality of the situation in the country. A handful of MEPs are endangering the European Parliament's reputation in fighting for human rights, democracy and rule of law." Next month Azerbaijan will be among several ex-Soviet states attending a summit with the EU in Lithuania, where agreements on closer co-operation will be signed. A London-based pro-democracy group, Electoral Reform International Services (Eris), was also sharply critical of the PACE/European Parliament statement. In a piece on the EU Observer website, Eris's Holly Ruthrauff said "the support of the EP and PACE for a clearly undemocratic election process is shameful, and is an affront to the stated values of those organisations. "Voters should ask their elected representatives why they are spending public funds to be cheerleaders for sham elections. The EP and the PACE should ask whether it makes sense to continue sending such observation missions, which discredit their organisations." </body>

      <body>Five children have been killed by an old mortar shell as they dug for scrap metal in South Sudan's capital, Juba. The five were looking for metal in an old army barracks, a military spokesman told the BBC. The BBC's James Copnall says unexploded ordnance and mines remain a big problem in South Sudan, following decades of civil war. There are clear-up operations under way in several areas of South Sudan, but such explosions kill people every year. The children, aged 10-14, were killed in a former barracks in Juba's Souk Sita district, army spokesman Col Philip Aguer said. He said that a Ugandan man who was with them, presumably to buy the scrap metal, was wounded. South Sudan gained independence in 2011 after a long conflict with the north but it remains one of the world's least developed countries. In addition to the explosives left over from the war, rebels have been accused of laying new mines, particularly in Unity state near the border with Sudan, our correspondent reports. This has at times made travel around the area dangerous, he adds. </body>

      <body>China's capital, Beijing, has announced measures to combat worsening air pollution, state-run media report. They include taking half of the city's four million private cars off the roads on days when there are serious levels of pollution. The system will be based on a vehicle's licence plate - odd numbers will be allowed on the roads one day, even numbers the next. Motor vehicles are considered a major source of pollution. The new system will give out four different degrees of air pollution warning - blue, yellow, amber and red, Xinhua news agency reports. On days when an amber warning is given, factories will stop production and work will be halted on construction and building sites. Restaurants which offer an open-air barbecue will be ordered to close temporarily and fireworks will be banned throughout the city. When a red warning is issued, the new car restriction measure will be implemented. Schools and kindergartens will also be closed. The measure to restrict the number of private cars from using the road is proving to be controversial. Critics have aired their concern that those who can afford to buy two or more cars will able to drive any day when the restriction is in force. Users of Weibo, China's version of Twitter, have also criticised the restriction for targeting ordinary people as cars used by government officials and civil servants are exempted. One user said that whenever there is a problem in Beijing, "ordinary people are the first to be forced to pay the price for it". Beijing has almost 21 million permanent residents, according to official estimates. There is also a large migrant population in the city, but no exact official figures are available. Most people relied on bicycles and public transport to get around in the city before private car ownership became popular. </body>

      <body>A policeman in the Indian city of Mumbai who became lost in a crowded railway station as a child has been reunited with his family after 24 years, thanks to a distinctive tattoo. Ganesh Raghunath Dhangade was six when he was separated from his parents as he boarded a train. After being raised in orphanages, Mr Dhangade joined the police force and began to search for his family. A vital clue was the name of his mother Manda, tattooed on his right arm. His search finally led him to the house of an old lady, who mentioned the tattoo and broke down in tears when he showed it to her. "She explained about the tattoo on her son's arm. That was when I showed it to her," Mr Dhangade told the BBC's Kinjal Pandya in Mumbai. "She was totally surprised - she couldn't believe it. She almost started screaming for joy. All the villagers and neighbours were screaming too." Mr Dhangade has two younger brothers and two younger sisters. His father died after he became lost and his mother has been working as a domestic help. "Now that I am earning, my mum can stop working and I can take care of the whole family," he said. His mother said: "I am so happy. I lost my son and he has come back as a police constable." </body>

      <body>Newark Mayor Cory Booker has won a special election to represent New Jersey in the US Senate. Mr Booker, 44, defeated Republican Steve Lonegan in a race to replace Senator Frank Lautenberg, a Democrat who died in June. With almost all of the vote counted, Mr Booker led Mr Lonegan by 55% to 44%. The Democratic mayor of New Jersey's largest city will become the second black senator in the current Congress and the first from New Jersey. On Thursday, Mr Booker acknowledged the Senate's low approval ratings in the wake of the highly partisan government shutdown and debt ceiling debate. But, he told MSNBC television's Morning Joe he was a "scrapper" who looked forward to tackling tough issues. "I'm hoping to join with a lot of good people from both sides of the aisle," he said. Considered a conservative activist, Steve Lonegan, 57, is a former mayor in Bogota, New Jersey, and the former New Jersey state director of Americans for Prosperity - a group funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, which advocates a limited role for government. Mr Booker has been mayor of Newark since 2006, when he came to power promising to turn round a city suffering from high unemployment, public corruption and rampant crime. Widely billed as a rising star in the Democratic Party, Mr Booker is a progressive on social issues, supporting same-sex marriage, healthcare reform and gun control. Both candidates sought to boost their campaigns with the backing of celebrities. While Mr Lonegan received the support of the former Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Cory Booker won the endorsement of US talk show host Oprah Winfrey. Mr Booker will serve the remaining 15 months of the late Mr Lautenberg's term and will have to run for re-election in November 2014. When he arrives in the Senate, replacing Republican appointee Jeff Chiesa, the Democrats will increase their control of the upper chamber to 55-45. </body>

      <body>The Guardian journalist who broke the Snowden leaks story is to join a new media project being set up by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. Glenn Greenwald confirmed he was leaving the UK newspaper for the mass media outlet being planned by the French-born billionaire. Laura Poitras, the documentary-maker who connected Greenwald with Edward Snowden, is also expected to join. Mr Snowden leaked details of US government surveillance programmes. The former US intelligence contractor is now living in Russia, where he was granted temporary asylum after fleeing Hong Kong in June, shortly after the revelations were published. On Wednesday, British Prime Minister David Cameron accused The Guardian of having knowingly compromised national security by publishing the leaks. Greenwald, a US citizen based in Brazil, insists that none of the information he published could have damaged national security. Announcing his new project in a statement, Mr Omidyar said he wanted to support "independent journalists in a way that leverages their work to the greatest extent possible, all in support of the public interest". His project, he said, was in its early stages but he had approached Greenwald and found that he and fellow Americans Poitras and Jeremy Scahill, an investigative journalist, were already contemplating something similar. "We had a lot of overlap in terms of our ideas, and decided to join forces," said Mr Omidyar. The billionaire said his new outlet would be independent of other media with the focus on allowing independent journalists to "pursue the truth in their fields". "And, I want to find ways to convert mainstream readers into engaged citizens," he said in the statement. Mr Omidyar's existing projects include the US-based Omidyar Network, a philanthropic investment firm which operates in some of Africa's most troubled countries. Forbes magazine estimated the Frenchman's net worth to be $8.5bn (£5.3bn; 6.3bn euros) last month. Announcing his departure in a statement on Tuesday, Greenwald said he was embarking on a "once-in-a-career dream journalistic opportunity". </body>

      <title>Mexico man with Asperger's wins case</title>
      <description>A 25-year-old Mexican with the autistic condition Asperger's wins the right to make key decisions about his life without parental consent.</description>

      <body>A 25-year-old Mexican with the autistic condition Asperger's has won the right to make key decisions about his life without parental consent. The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Ricardo Adair by four votes to one. Mr Adair said that Mexican legislation violated the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It banned him from doing simple tasks by himself, such as applying for a passport, because of his condition. A judge will be appointed to agree which decisions Mr Adair will be allowed to make without the consent of a parent or guardian. The groundbreaking ruling is expected to have wider implications for the rights of people with autism in Latin America, says the BBC's Will Grant. "I want to be allowed to decide what to do, where to go, where and with whom I want to live or travel, where to work or study," Mr Adair told the Mexican Supreme Court. Mexican legislation makes straightforward tasks, such as buying a mobile phone, enrolling in university or applying for a driving licence, very difficult for people with Asperger's syndrome or other forms of autism. Mr Adair said all papers had to be signed by his parents or legal guardians. He began his battle two years ago and has been supported in his fight by a non-profit organisation. "All we wanted was for Ricardo's own free will to come first, and now the court has recognised that," his lawyer, Andres Gomez Montt, told the BBC. Mr Adair said he wanted to read the full court ruling before making further comments, but expressed his satisfaction at the decision. "They have asserted our rights and I believe this is a great step forward," he said. Mexican legislation on people with disabilities was drafted with the intention of protecting them, by taking away legal responsibility for their actions, but Mr Adair's mother says the law is out of date. "Many children have different levels of disability. Some need more support, some need less. This should be about giving to each one what they need," Leticia Robles told BBC Mundo earlier this year. The UN's World Health Organization describes autism spectrum disorders as "a group of complex brain development disorders". It affects one in each 160 children around the world on average, the WHO says. "These disorders [which include Asperger's syndrome] are characterized by difficulties in social interaction and communication and a restricted and repetitive repertoire of interests and activities." </body>

      <title>Amazonia 'ruled' by 227 tree species</title>

      <body>Despite being home to about 16,000 tree species, just 227 "hyperdominant" species account for half of Amazonia's total trees, a study suggests. An international team of researchers found that the region was, in total, home to an estimated 390 billion trees. Writing in Science, they added that the rarest 11,000 species made up only 0.12% of tree cover. However, they added that the new data could help unlock ecological secrets held by the biodiversity hotspot. The results were based on a survey of 1,170 plots and half-a-million trees across the six-million-square-kilometre area, often described as the lungs of the world. The authors said that the underlying cause of the hyper dominance of the 227 species, which accounted for 1.4% of the estimated number of species in the region, remained unknown. "We knew that, normally, a few species dominate ecosystems, but if you have a system that has 16,000 tree species but just 227 make up half of the trees, that was pretty surprising even for us," said lead author Dr Hans ter Steege from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands. He told the Science podcast: "We don't really know why these species are so incredibly dominant because they do not have any particular ecological feature that stands out." In the paper, Dr ter Steege and the team of more than 100 scientists wrote that there was no evidence that two key functional traits for trees - seed mass and wood density - played a part in determining what species dominated the landscape. "The 227 hyperdominant species include both shade-tolerant, typically large-seeded climax species with dense wood and shade-intolerant, small seeded pioneer (species) with light wood," they observed. The most dominant species was indentified as Euterpe precatoria, a palm tree native to central and southern America, with a mean estimate population of more than five billion individuals within Amazonia. Conversely, the researchers noted that the rarest 5,800 species had communities with fewer than 1,000 individuals, adding: "which is sufficient to classify those that are endemic as globally threatened". They suggested further analysis would show that the species identified as hyperdominant would be "disproportionately resistant to pathogens, specialist herbivores and other sources of frequency-dependent mortality". Dr ter Steege said the data could also be used by conservationists to find out what species were found in protected areas, such as national parks, and what ones were located in unprotected areas, and were therefore vulnerable to threat such as deforestation. </body>

      <description>Child protection agencies warn social workers to watch out for couples returning from Africa with "miracle babies" as they could be trafficked.</description>

      <body>Social services have been warned to watch out for couples returning from Africa with "miracle babies" as they could be a cover for trafficking. Child protection organisations Cafcass, ADCS and Children and Families Across Borders (CFAB) have issued guidance to all social workers in the UK. They want to help them recognise signs of staged fake births. The Family Court has seen five cases of couples attempting to bring babies into the UK whom they are not related to. One couple claimed fertility treatment combined with their strong Christian faith had resulted in them conceiving in Nigeria - but tests showed the child, who was later taken into care, was not theirs. A dozen more cases were detected by the British consulate in Lagos - though officials say that the real numbers could be much higher. Charities voice 'miracle baby' fears Andy Elvin, chief executive of CFAB, described the cases as "disturbing" and urged social workers to involve the police, who can investigate whether couples have been involved in criminal activity or are the victims of a "cruel deception". "The most disturbing element is that babies are for sale," he said. "In the 21st century, humans are being bought and sold for somewhere in the region of £12,000. It's something we thought went out with slavery. "It's shocking that people are willing to sell babies, but it's just as shocking that people will buy them." Mr Elvin said that many of the birth mothers will have been coerced, and may even have been sold into prostitution. "There are many victims, but the real victims are of course the children," he said. "They won't know anything about their origins. It's like the dark days of adoption when people thought it best not to tell the child anything. "The effect on a child who discovers their life to be a lie can be profound - and can lead to mental health problems later on." CFAB worked with Cafcass - the Children and Family Court Advisory Service - and ADCS (Association of Directors of Children's Services) to produce a multi-agency information leaflet to assist social workers to recognise and understand the signs of faked birth - such as a lack of antenatal appointments - and to encourage referrals to the relevant authorities. Mr Elvin said that the aim was to "suspend disbelief" of such practices occurring and to work to prevent what he described as a "100% increase" in cases since 2005. In October last year, the High Court ruled that a couple could keep a baby they brought back from Nigeria - even though tests showed they were not the biological parents. The woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, said she'd gone to the country for fertility treatment and was tricked into believing she had given birth. The presiding judge Mr Justice Coleridge said the pair - who he described as "people of the highest calibre and integrity" - were victims of the "most appalling scam". </body>

      <body>Sportswear giant Puma has ended its association with the South African FA (Safa) following the match-fixing scandal involving the national team. The news comes two days after banking group Absa ended its six-year association with Bafana Bafana. In December, a Fifa investigation found 'compelling evidence' that four South Africa friendlies had been fixed prior to their hosting of the 2010 World Cup. In a statement, Puma announced the deal had ended with "immediate effect". "Following match fixing allegations made against Safa along with inappropriate responses from within the football organisation (including the suspension of senior officials), PUMA terminated the contract with immediate effect," the press release read. Former Safa president Kirsten Nematandani, who lost his post in last month's elections, and four fellow officials were suspended in 2012 before being reinstated a month later pending further investigation. South Africa, which staged the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations earlier this year, has failed to qualify for the 2014 World Cup, so becoming the first hosts to miss the next edition of the tournament in a quarter of a century. The country's football has been in a steady state of decline since winning the Africa Cup of Nations in 1996, with the side's last actual qualification for the World Cup coming back in 2002. Yet Puma has blamed the 2010 games against Thailand, Bulgaria, Colombia and Guatemala as the primary reason for ending a deal that began in 2011 and which was expected to run until at least 2018. "PUMA abides by a code of ethics in all areas of its business operations and expects its partners to adhere to the same values," its statement read. "PUMA would like to state that with notable exception to the issues in question it enjoyed a good working relationship with SAFA, and wishes them well for the future." Safa has yet to publicly comment on the matter. </body>

      <body>A woman who was gang-raped in the Indian city of Mumbai in August has fainted in court while giving evidence. The photojournalist, who was attacked while on assignment in a deserted mill, was taken to a local hospital. Earlier the victim, aged 22, identified four of the men accused of raping her. Women's safety has been the focus of attention in India since a brutal gang rape and murder in Delhi last year, after which the Indian government strengthened its sexual violence laws. The photojournalist, who cannot be identified, had been giving evidence for more than four hours when she collapsed, said public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam. The victim was very composed, but was "under mental pressure", Mr Nikam told the BBC. He said she had identified all four men who stood trial in court on Thursday. A fifth suspect is being tried separately by a juvenile court. The photographer also identified pornographic video clips that she said she was shown while she was raped, said the special public prosecutor. Proceedings were stopped when the rape survivor collapsed, Mr Nikam said. Last month, four men were convicted and sentenced to death over the gang-rape and murder of a young woman in Delhi in December. The case led to widespread protests across India and highlighted the extent of attacks on women in the country. A bill containing harsher punishments for rapists, including the death penalty, was approved by India's parliament earlier this year. But many working in the legal system say not enough is done to protect those who bring rape cases to court. </body>

      <body>A plane carrying 49 passengers and crew that crashed in southern Laos hit bad weather as it came into land, officials in the South East Asian nation said. The Lao Airlines plane, flying from the capital Vientiane, crashed into the Mekong river on Wednesday near its destination of Pakse. All 44 passengers and five crew are believed to have died. Footage of the scene on Thursday showed divers in the Mekong river, pulling out parts of the wreckage. The passengers and crew came from a total of 10 nations, the airline said. Seventeen Laos nationals were on board, plus travellers from France, Australia, Thailand, Vietnam, Canada, China, Malaysia, Taiwan and the US. "Upon preparing to land at Pakse Airport the aircraft ran into extreme bad weather conditions and was reportedly crashed into the Mekong river,'' the Laos Ministry of Public Works and Transport said in a statement. State-run Laos news agency quoted an eyewitness as saying that the plane "appeared to be hit by a strong wind, causing its head to ascend and pushing it away from the airport area". A senior aviation official from Laos was quoted in other reports as saying the tail end of Typhoon Nari may have been a factor in the crash. An Agence-France Presse (AFP) reporter on the scene told of debris floating in the river and suitcases buried in mud on the river banks. "The search teams in Laos are taking the bodies to a local hospital," Thai foreign ministry spokesman Sek Wannamethee told AFP. An official in Pakse was quoted as saying at least six bodies had been retrieved. The plane was an ATR 72-600 twin turboprop engine aircraft. Its manufacturer, ATR, said in a statement that the plane was "delivered from the production line in March 2013". The company said it would co-operate fully with the investigation. Australian's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said that six Australians, including four members of one family, were aboard the plane. An Australian aid worker and his father were also among those believed to have been killed. DFAT released a photo of the two Australians - father and son Gordon and Michael Creighton. The family said in a statement that they had "lost a father, a husband, a son, a brother, a fiance and a best mate in one tragic circumstance". Relatives of the Rhodes family also released a photo of Gavin, a tax consultant, his wife, Phoumalaysy and their two young children. A DFAT spokesperson said that consular officials were in contact with the families of the victims and were travelling to Pakse. However, a DFAT statement said: "Lao authorities have told our embassy in Vientiane they do not expect any survivors.'' The route between the capital Vientiane and Pakse is popular with the growing numbers of tourists visiting Laos, correspondents say. Lao Airlines is small company, with just 14 aircraft in its fleet. It flies several domestic routes and has flights to other countries in the region like China, Thailand and Singapore. </body>

      <body>A French court has postponed the trial of a Norwegian neo-Nazi musician after his lawyer requested more time to read documents and prepare his defence. Kristian "Varg" Vikernes will now face trial in June 2014 on charges of inciting racial hatred and glorifying war crimes. The Norwegian was accused of planning a terrorist act after his wife, a licensed gun holder, bought weapons. French authorities later conceded there was no plot and the two were released. Mr Vikernes is a self-proclaimed neo-Nazi who was once in touch with his compatriot Anders Breivik, the Norwegian far-right militant who killed 77 people in attacks in Norway in 2011. In May 1994 Mr Vikernes received a prison sentence for murdering the guitarist of a rival black metal band and setting fire to churches in Norway. After his release in 2009 he moved to France with his wife and children. French authorities placed him under surveillance. On 16 July they arrested the couple in the southern region of Correze after the wife began buying shotguns. Officials later said she had a valid firearms permit and released the pair. Mr Vikernes has vowed to sue the French authorities for arresting him with "no good reason" and "in the most brutal way possible". He says officials have not returned his firearms or his ceremonial weaponry, including his swords, spears, and helmets. Since coming to France, Mr Vikernes has continued releasing music and writing. He will be tried on incitement charges related to postings on his blog which prosecutors say were "anti-Semitic and xenophobic". Through his writings he promotes what he calls "Odalism", an ideology based on the idea that White Europeans should re-adopt "native European values". </body>

      <title>Nazi's body moved to Italian airport</title>
      <description>The body of Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke is taken to a Rome airport after his funeral was called off, amid reports it could be sent to Germany.</description>

      <body>The coffin of Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke has been taken to a military airport near Rome after a funeral was halted following angry protests. Italian officials said contacts had been made with Germany, amid media reports that Priebke's body could be flown there. Priebke died under house arrest last week. He had been jailed for life over the killing of more than 300 civilians. Italian media say his body could be kept at the airport for the time being. A funeral in Albano Laziale, south of Rome, was called off on Tuesday amid scuffles between protesters and Nazi sympathisers. A senior official in Rome province, Giuseppe Pecoraro, was quoted on Wednesday as saying Italian authorities had "initiated contacts with Germany." "It's not in my remit to decide on a cremation or a place of burial, but we are working to resolve the situation according to what is most suitable," he said. Both Argentina - where Priebke lived for nearly 50 years before being extradited to Italy - and Priebke's hometown in Germany have previously refused to take the body. A spokesman for the German foreign ministry said he knew of no laws preventing a German who had died abroad from being buried in Germany, but that it was normally "a matter for the relatives" to decide. The row coincided with commemorations held for the 70th anniversary of the roundup of Jews in the Rome ghetto and their deportation to Auschwitz during World War II. Priebke died on Friday, aged 100. He was one of the SS officers overseeing the killing of men and boys at Rome's Ardeatine Caves in 1944, one of the worst massacres in Italy during World War II. In a reprisal for the killing of 33 German soldiers in Rome by resistance fighters, 335 Italian civilians were shot dead. It is believed that Adolf Hitler ordered 10 Italians killed for every German. Though Priebke admitted his role in the massacre, he never expressed any remorse and maintained he was following orders. He was extradited in 1994 after investigative journalists from US television network ABC News tracked him down in Argentina. In 1998, he was sentenced to life in prison. However, he pleaded that he was too old and sick for jail, and was soon allowed to switch to a regime of house arrest. The Vatican had issued an unprecedented ban on holding Priebke's funeral in any Catholic church in Rome, but a Catholic splinter group, the Society of St Pius X, offered to hold the ceremony. As the coffin was taken to the Society's seminary in Albano Laziale on Wednesday, protesters shouted "murderer" and "executioner" and clashed with Nazi sympathisers as his coffin passed. "We had to cancel the funeral yesterday because there was a risk that it could have become a neo-Nazi demonstration," said Mr Pecoraro. Priebke's lawyer, Paolo Giachini, said it had been stopped because the authorities had prevented friends and family entering. </body>

      <body>A Palestinian man who used a tractor to break into an Israeli army base in the West Bank has been shot and killed by soldiers, according to a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces. The man broke down the gate to the base, between Ramallah and Jerusalem. Military doctors treated the man for his injuries but he died a short time later. There were no Israeli injuries. Palestinian sources told AFP that the dead man was named Yusef Ahmed al-Radaydeh. There have been a number of recent deadly attacks by Palestinians on Israelis in the West Bank, as well as the shooting of a nine-year-old girl a fortnight ago. The BBC's Kevin Connolly, in Jerusalem, says the violent incidents form an unpromising backdrop to the peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, which continue behind closed doors. </body>

      <title>Syrian refugees 'detained in Egypt'</title>
      <description>Syrian refugees fleeing to Egypt face unlawful detention, often in deplorable conditions, or deportation, Amnesty International says.</description>

      <body>Syrian refugees in Egypt often face illegal detention or deportation, Amnesty International says. The authorities are holding hundreds of Syrian refugees in deplorable conditions, among them children as young as one, the rights group says. Some of them are accused of being Muslim Brotherhood supporters, and being complicit in the recent political violence in Egypt, Amnesty said. The Egyptian authorities have not yet responded to the findings. The UN estimates that by the end of 2014 more than eight million Syrians could have been forced from their homes, and the number of refugees outside Syria could hit 5.2 million. Syria's civil war began in the wake of the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011, which saw Egypt's long-time President Hosni Mubarak toppled. "The Egyptian authorities have a duty to provide protection to anyone who has fled the conflict in Syria and is seeking safe refuge in their country," Sherif Elsayed Ali, Amnesty International's head of refugee and migrants' rights, said in a statement. "At present Egypt is failing abysmally to meet its international obligations to protect even the most vulnerable refugees. "Instead of offering vital help and support... the Egyptian authorities are arresting and deporting them." Prior to the military ousting of President Mohammed Morsi, Syrian refugees told Amnesty International that they felt safe and protected in Egypt. However, in July and August, following Mr Morsi's removal, their situation turned for the worse when some public figures and parts of the mainstream media started accusing Syrians of being supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and taking part in pro-Morsi demonstrations, Amnesty said. "My kids can't play outside anymore. They are cursed by the other kids, told really bad words… There were 1,700 [refugees] living in the area, but now there are no more than 500," a Syrian refugee in a suburb of 6 October City outside Cairo told Amnesty this month. The campaign group's report - "We cannot live here any more": Refugees from Syria in Egypt - says this change in atmosphere has prompted some Syrians to try to reach Europe by boat. Many of those detained had been stopped whilst trying to make the hazardous crossing across the Mediterranean Sea. The report says the Egyptian navy has intercepted around 13 boats since August and, according to UN refugee agency, arrested 946 people, 724 of whom remain in detention. Several lawyers said they were prevented from representing refugees detained in police stations along the Mediterranean coast, the report said. Scores of Syrian children are being detained, many without their parents and some detainees have been held in unsanitary conditions in police stations without food or medical assistance, it said. During a visit to a police station in the port city of Alexandria last week, Amnesty researchers found about 40 Syrian refugees unlawfully and indefinitely detained, including 10 children, the youngest of whom were one-year-old twins held there since 17 September. Several detainees told Amnesty International that police threatened to transfer them to Al-Khalifa prison in Cairo unless they signed papers accepting deportation to countries in the region or back to Syria. Lawyers told researchers that in at least two instances refugees were collectively deported back to Damascus, Amnesty says. Earlier this month a group of 36 mostly Palestinian refugees from Syria were deported to Damascus. Amnesty said many of them are believed to have been detained in Damascus at the Palestine Branch of Syrian Military Intelligence, one of the most feared sections of Syria's secret service. "Sending refugees back to a bloody conflict zone is a serious violation of international law," Mr Ali said. The report was also critical of new restrictions on Syrian nationals entering Egypt, requiring them to have a visa and security clearance before arrival. </body>

      <title>British Gas raises prices by 9.2%</title>
      <description>British Gas is to increase prices for domestic customers, with a dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November.</description>

      <body>British Gas is to increase prices for domestic customers, with a dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November. The increase, which will affect nearly eight million households in the UK, includes an 8.4% rise in gas prices and a 10.4% increase in electricity prices. The company said it "understands the frustration" of prices rising faster than incomes. The average annual household bill will go up by £123. PM David Cameron has urged consumers to switch suppliers for the best deal. Energy Minister Ed Davey has described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers. Rival SSE has already announced an 8.2% increase in bills from 15 November. On average, customers will see a dual-fuel bill increase to £1,444 a year. However, there are significant regional variations. On average, the biggest increase in a dual-fuel bill is an 11.2% rise in the north of Scotland, in the Scottish Hydro Electric region. The smallest is a 6.8% increase in the south west of England. The company said that the cost of buying energy on the global markets, delivering gas and electricity to customers' homes, and the government's "green" levies, were all factors in the decision to put up prices. "I know these are difficult times for many customers and totally understand the frustration that so many household costs keep on rising when incomes are not keeping pace," said Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas Residential Energy. "We haven't taken this decision lightly, but what is pushing up energy prices at the moment are costs that are not all directly under our control." The company, which operates as Scottish Gas in Scotland, said it made a profit of five pence in the pound after tax. British Gas, the UK's biggest energy supplier, said in May that a profit boost would be used to delay future price rises. This came because customers used 18% more gas in the first four months of the year owing to the cold weather. At the time, a spokesman said: "We will use that [cold weather benefit] to effectively hold prices for as long as possible." Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. Caroline Flint, shadow energy secretary, said: "These latest price rises show clearer than ever why Labour's price freeze is needed." Party leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But the prime minister branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. Mr Cameron also said he was disappointed with the British Gas' announcement. "I would encourage customers who are not happy with the service they're getting, are not happy with the prices, to go to the switching sites online and see whether they can get a better deal," he said. Pressed on whether the government could do more to tackle the underlying issues, Mr Cameron added: "What we can do, which is what we are doing, is to try to get new suppliers into the market." Energy Minister Ed Davey also described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers of British Gas. He questioned the claim that costs imposed by the government were increasing as much as bills and told the Commons that unhappy consumers should consider switching suppliers. However, industry analysts expect other suppliers to announce price rises in the coming weeks, which could affect consumers' switching decisions. "The question now is whether it will be a trickle or a stampede. However, the fact is that households will be struggling to afford to keep warm this winter," said Tom Lyon, of price comparison website Uswitch.com. Ofgem data shows the number of people switching energy companies is at the lowest since records began in 2003. Out of more than 27.7m electricity customers, 658,000 people switched companies in the three months from March to June in 2013, 17% less than the same quarter a year before. For gas, out of nearly 22m customers, 490,000 people transferred over the same three-month period, a 14% decline from 2012. Personal finance commentator and campaigner Martin Lewis said it was important that, if consumers do decide to switch, they should focus on fixed rate tariffs. Because only two of the energy companies have currently put their prices up, those who switch now are likely to be hit with price rises if they switch to another variable rate tariff. He said people can "beat the price hikes" by going to fixed tariffs. Adam Scorer, of watchdog Consumer Futures, said: "We would urge anyone worried about their energy costs to shop around to try to find a better deal and ensure they are on the cheapest payment method, such as direct debit. "There are also some discounted insulation and heating measures available and we would encourage people to take advantage of this to cut their bills." Mr Davey said that British Gas would need to justify its decision "openly and transparently". Many of British Gas's customers made their annoyance at the price rise known during a Twitter question and answer session with customer service Bert Pijls earlier this afternoon. </body>

      <title>Hundreds more Madeleine calls</title>
      <description>Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have received more than 2,400 calls and emails since a BBC Crimewatch appeal on Monday.</description>

      <body>Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have received more than 2,400 calls and emails since an appeal on BBC's Crimewatch on Monday. Writing on Twitter, Det Ch Insp Andy Redwood said further appeals on similar programmes in the Netherlands and Germany had led to hundreds of calls. Madeleine, from Rothley, Leicestershire, was three when she disappeared in Portugal in May 2007. Det Ch Insp Redwood has said her abduction could have been pre-planned. Detectives released two e-fits of a man seen carrying a child in Praia da Luz at 22:00 on the night Madeleine went missing and it was revealed that they now suspected Madeleine could have been taken later than previously thought - just before her mother returned to the apartment to check on her. Following his appeal on Crimewatch, Det Ch Insp Redwood travelled to the Netherlands and Germany. Clickable map and timeline He tweeted on Thursday: ""Over 350 people have phoned into the studio of Opsporing Verzocht, Holland and 500 in Germany on Aktenzeichen XY. "Those enquiries are now being assessed and prioritised. Any deemed high being actioned." He added that the police were "very pleased" with the information they had been receiving. The next stage of the appeal will be in Ireland later this month. The Metropolitan Police are offering a £20,000 reward for information. Det Ch Insp Redwood told Crimewatch a number of men had been seen by witnesses in the area on the day Madeleine vanished and one theory was they could have been carrying out reconnaissance. He said they wanted to track down men seen "lurking suspiciously" near the McCanns' apartment. The Metropolitan Police say their inquiries have led to the new timeline and "accepted version of events" surrounding Madeleine's disappearance being significantly changed. The two e-fit images released are of a man a family had seen with a blond-haired child of three or four, possibly wearing pyjamas, heading away from the McCanns' holiday apartment. Det Ch Insp Redwood said he could be the man who took Madeleine - but there could be an innocent explanation. He also said there had been a four-fold increase in the number of burglaries in the area between January and May 2007 and one possible scenario was that Madeleine had disturbed a burglar. Police are also looking at possible bogus charity collectors operating in the area at the time and have released two e-fit images of Portuguese men they would like to identify. Police have also released e-fit images of two men seen in the area around the time that Madeleine disappeared. Two are of fair-haired men who fit similar descriptions. The Portuguese police shelved their inquiry in 2008, but Scotland Yard began a review of the case in May 2011 and opened a formal investigation in July this year. </body>

      <title>Google earnings beat expectations</title>
      <description>Recovering from a surprising miss last quarter, Google reports a profit of $2.97bn (£1.84bn) during the July -September period, beating expectations.</description>

      <body>Google has reported a profit of $2.97bn (£1.84bn) during the July -September period, beating expectations. The company missed forecasts during the last quarter. However, a closely watched measure, cost per click - how much advertisers pay to place an advert - declined by 8% from the same period last year. Google boss Larry Page said a statement that: "Google had another strong quarter with...great product progress". Shares in the company jumped to an all time high in after hours trading. Overall, paid clicks increased by 28% from the same time last year, and were up 8% from the previous quarter. This is taken as a good sign by analysts, as advertising makes up the dominant share of Google's profits. The company's troubled Motorola unit continued to be a drag on the figures, however. It lost Google $248m, despite the launch of the flagship Moto X phone in August. Mobile battle In a call to discuss earnings with investors, Mr Page highlighted just how dominant mobile has become among consumers. He said that 40% of users reached YouTube through their mobile phones compared to just 6% two years earlier. Analysts were closely watching how Google is faring in this mobile transition, particularly as it relates to advertising. Google charges less for mobile than for its traditional web browser ads, which is why even though ad sales increased throughout the quarter, the cost per click figure declined. Research firm eMarketer estimates that the mobile ad market worldwide will grow 89% to $16.65bn this year; up from $8.8bn in 2012. Google's market share in the ad market is $6.9%. This has recently slipped slightly as rival Facebook has made inroads. Facebook now has 14.9% of the market, a jump from 9% last year. In a personal move, Mr Page said that he would no longer be participating in every earnings call. While he said this move was intended to better prioritise his time, many observers noted that his voice remained strained after surgery to repair an injured vocal chord. </body>

      <title>Osborne agrees to China nuclear deal</title>
      <description>The Chancellor, George Osborne, announces that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.</description>

      <body>The Chancellor, George Osborne, has announced that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. The announcement also said that Chinese firms might eventually be allowed to take majority stakes in British nuclear plants. Mr Osborne made the announcement on the last day of a trade visit to China. The first China deal could be as early as next week, with the go ahead for a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site. Also on Thursday, a report commissioned for the prime minister warned of a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years. The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits". Supply is expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15. Most existing coal-fired plants are expected to be closed in 2015 to meet European Union pollution directives, while many gas-fired power plants are not being used at the moment because gas is so expensive. These would take time and money to bring back on stream. The Hinkley C project, in Somerset, will be the first new nuclear power station since 1995. Hinkley C's construction will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EDF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs. EDF has been negotiating with three Chinese nuclear giants on the Hinkley C project - CGN, CNNC and SNPTC - all of which have been seen by the chancellor this week. Our business editor, Robert Peston, says he has been told that one or two of these will end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C. A DECC spokesperson said talks about a contract were underway: "Negotiations remain ongoing between the government and EDF on the potential terms of an investment contract for Hinkley Point C. No agreement has as yet been reached. "A contract will only be offered if it is value for money, fair and affordable, in line with government policy on no public subsidy for new nuclear and consistent with state-aid rules." Mr Osborne made the announcement while on a visit to the Taishan nuclear plant in southern China on Thursday which is itself a collaboration between EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG). He said: "Today is another demonstration of the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China, the world's oldest civil nuclear power and the world's fastest growing civil nuclear power." The memorandum of understanding also includes roles for British companies in China's nuclear programme. China has 17 nuclear reactors in operation, which provide about 1% of its electricity production capacity. In the future, Chinese firms might be allowed more than just minority stakes in UK plants. The government said that "over time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes". At the weekend, the Energy Minister, Ed Davey, said he believed that a "massive" wave of investment from China, Japan and Korea would secure UK's power supply into the future. Securing future energy supplies is a major challenge. A portion of energy bills is being diverted to alternative energy investment in wind farms and solar energy. But these, renewable, energy sources cannot provide enough power for the country's energy needs. The industry regulator, Ofgem, has also warned of the "unprecedented challenge" to secure power supplies. It said spare electricity power production capacity could fall to 2% by 2015, increasing the risk of blackouts. </body>

      <title>FA supports Hodgson over 'joke'</title>
      <description>The Football Association says England boss Roy Hodgson has its full support after claims he made an offensive joke.</description>

      <body>The Football Association has given its "full support" to Roy Hodgson after claims a comment made in a team-talk by the England manager caused offence. Hodgson was criticised for referring to a joke about a monkey and an astronaut at half-time in Tuesday's World Cup qualifier against Poland. "He has and deserves the full support of the Football Association," FA chairman Greg Dyke said. Anti-racism campaigners Kick It Out praised the FA's "swift" response. It had called for an investigation into Hodgson's comments but, after the FA confirmed it had not received any complaints from the England players, it now considered the matter closed. A Kick It Out statement read: "We are pleased that the Football Association has investigated this matter swiftly and issued its findings immediately. "If there has been no complaint on the back of the investigation then the matter can only be deemed as concluded. "Kick It Out acts on behalf of the football community at large and when an allegation of a racist or discriminatory nature is made, it's the organisation's role to follow this up." Hodgson was reported  to have referenced the joke when trying to explain to right-back Chris Smalling that he needed to pass the ball to winger Andros Townsend more. The joke, the exact wording of which is still unclear, revolves around an astronaut and a monkey on a Nasa mission. The monkey performs all the tasks requested by mission control, with the punchline being that the astronaut's only role is to feed the monkey. The England manager later apologised and Townsend, 22, tweeted:  "I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken!" Dyke added: "Roy Hodgson is a man of the highest integrity, an honourable man who is doing a great job with the England team. "He has fully explained to us what he said and the point he was making to the players in the dressing room at half-time on Tuesday night. He has also explained the context in which he made his remarks. "He has made clear there was no intent to say anything inappropriate, and he was certainly not making any comments with any racist connotation. Importantly, he has apologised for any unintended offence that may have been taken. "We will be making no further comment on this story and will now be giving Roy and the team our full support as we prepare for the World Cup in Brazil." England striker Wayne Rooney also showed his support for 66-year-old Hodgson on Twitter,  and via his personal website:  "To be honest it's really annoying that something such as this should see the light of day. "All the lads know what type of guy Roy is, and to try and pin some form of label on him is absolutely ridiculous. Roy spoke to Andros straight away, and he took no offence whatsoever. Hopefully that's now the end of the matter." Former England striker Stan Collymore, 42, also defended the former Fulham and West Brom boss on Twitter,  suggesting the row undermines moves to eradicate racism from the sport. "Demeans every anti-racism campaigner by having cheap pop at RH [Roy Hodgson] who said nothing wrong. Makes campaigners seem over-PC and petty. They're not," he said. However, Piara Powar, executive director of Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare), told the BBC that Hodgson had got it wrong. "This was a silly phrase to use in a diverse workforce," said Powar. "I think some players will see it as a reflection of the type of language still used by some coaches and some attitudes that still prevail." </body>

      <body>Pakistan ended South Africa's 15-match unbeaten run with a seven-wicket victory in the first Test in Abu Dhabi. Chasing 40 to beat the world number one side on day four, Pakistan wobbled on 7-3 before completing only a fourth ever victory over the Proteas. South Africa had previously been bowled out for 249 and 232, either side of centuries from Khurram Manzoor and Misbah-ul-Haq taking Pakistan to 442. In their last Test match, Pakistan lost by 24 runs to Zimbabwe. Misbah's side had also been whitewashed 3-0 in South Africa in February, but they continued a fine run of form in the United Arab Emirates - their adopted home after a terrorist attack on the Sri Lanka team in Lahore in 2009. Since then, Pakistan are unbeaten in nine matches in the UAE - a streak that includes the 3-0 whitewash of England in 2012. Victory over the Proteas was delayed by the efforts of AB De Villiers and Robin Peterson, who at least ensured Graeme Smith's side avoided an innings defeat. The tourists began the final day on 72-4 - still 121 short of making Pakistan bat again - and slipped further into trouble at 133-6 when Faf du Plessis drilled at off-spinner Saeed Ajmal, who took a fine return catch. De Villiers, though, found an ally in Peterson for a busy stand of 57, only for the wicketkeeper to fall 10 short of a century, driving Junaid Khan to Shan Masood Khan. Peterson's defiance continued, but with Ajmal wrapping up the tail for four wickets in the innings and seven in the match, Pakistan were facing a meagre target. They stumbled as Vernon Philander and Dale Steyn tore through the top three, but Misbah, supported by Younus Khan, led his side to victory on 28 not out, sealing the win by hitting Peterson for six. Pakistan lead the two-Test series 1-0, with the second match beginning in Dubai on Wednesday. </body>

      <title>England will not be World Cup seed</title>
      <description>England rise to 10th in the Fifa rankings, but will not be one of eight seeded teams at next year's World Cup in Brazil.</description>

      <body>England will not be one of the top eight seeds at next year's World Cup in Brazil after sealing qualification with a 2-0 win over Poland on Tuesday. Fifa's latest world rankings determined the top seeds for the 2014 tournament. England who climbed from 17th to 10th, will now have to face one of the top-ranked nations in their group matches. But boss Roy Hodgson says he is not worried whether his team is "first or second out of the hat" when the draw takes place on 6 December. The Netherlands, who were runners-up in 2010, and 2006 winners Italy are also unseeded. But Switzerland, Belgium and Colombia are, following the release of the rankings on Thursday by football's governing body. Hosts Brazil and the remaining top seven ranked qualifiers will be kept apart in the group stages of next year's tournament. Those groups will be completed by teams from three different geographical regions. England will have to face one of Brazil, Spain, Argentina, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Colombia and probably Uruguay. Uruguay's place in Brazil depends on them winning a play-off against Jordan, ranked 70, next month. If they are beaten in the two-legged tie, the Netherlands will take the final seed ahead of Italy. The rankings' emphasis on recent results rather than teams' record in major tournaments means 2010 World Cup runners-up Netherlands and 2006 winners Italy miss out on being kept apart from the other traditional powerhouses of world football. Barring a slump down the Fifa standings for any of the three, the Netherlands, Italy and England are likely to be kept apart as high-ranked fellow European nations. France coach Didier Deschamps, whose side have to win a two-legged play-off to make the finals after finishing second to Spain in their qualifying group, has criticised the system. "From my point of view it's not very logical,'' said the former Chelsea midfielder. He added that it was a "double punishment" that his side were in Group I, the only European one with five rather than six teams, meaning they had two fewer matches to earn ranking points. As well as a seed and an unseeded European qualifier, each of the World Cup groups is likely to be completed by a team from a combined Asia, Oceania and North and Central America pot and one of the unseeded African and South American qualifiers or the lowest-ranked European qualifier. Spain remain at the top of the rankings, ahead of Germany who leapfrog Argentina to take second spot. Scotland have climbed 28 places to 35th in the world after beating Croatia and Macedonia in the final two games of their unsuccessful qualification campaign. Wales are up eight places to 44th in the wake of their 1-1 draw with Belgium, while Northern Ireland drop four places to 90th following their 1-1 draw away to Israel. </body>

      <body>American film director Michael Bay has been injured in an attack in Hong Kong while filming on the set of his latest Transformers film. Two men have been arrested on suspicion of blackmail and assault after they demanded money from the film crew, police have said. Mr Bay, 48, received injuries to the right side of his face. But he declined to seek treatment and continued filming in a busy area of Hong Kong island. A local newspaper in Hong Kong reported that three men caused what it called "a huge disturbance" to the filming of the American science fiction film. It said that the men could have missed out on disturbance fees which the film crew paid to shop and business owners whose businesses were likely to be affected during filming. The two men approached Mr Bay on the set during filming, a police spokeswoman told Reuters. One of them demanded payment of HK$100,000 ($12,900; £8,030). As the discussion continued, the man assaulted Mr Bay and also attacked three police officers who tried to intervene, police say. The officers received treatment at hospital for minor injuries. Police also arrested a third man at the scene. There has been no comment from Mr Bay or his crew on the incident. The fourth instalment of the Transformers franchise starring Mark Wahlberg and Nicola Peltz is scheduled for public release in June 2014. Hong Kong's striking Victoria Harbour is believed to be among the film's locations, along with the city's dense and bustling streets. </body>

      <body>Glee creator Ryan Murphy has confirmed the musical show will end after the next series, it has been reported. Speaking at a media event in Los Angeles, Murphy said he had planned for the sixth season to revolve around the characters of Rachel and Finn. However, following the death of actor Cory Monteith, who played Finn, in July, he was forced to create a new ending, TV Line reported. He added he had penned a new finale that would be in Monteith's honour. "The final year of the show, which will be next year, was designed around Rachel and Cory/Finn's story," Murphy said. "I always knew that, I always knew how it would end. I knew what the last shot was - he was in it. I knew what the last line was - she said it to him. "So when a tragedy like that happens you sort of have to pause and figure out what you want to do, so we're figuring that out now." Murphy said he planned to pitch his new ending for the show to US network Fox later this month. "I think it's very satisfactory and kind of in [Monteith's] honour, which I love," he added. The show said goodbye to the actor in a special tribute episode broadcast in the US last week. In April this year, Fox renewed Glee for a fifth and sixth season as part of a two-season deal. It had been hinted the sixth series could be the last, however it was not confirmed at the time. </body>

      <body>American character actor Ed Lauter, recently seen in the Oscar-winning The Artist, has died aged 74, it has been announced. Lauter played chauffer to the female character Peppy Miller, played by Oscar nominee actress Berenice Bejo. Publicist Edward Lozzi said Lauter died on Wednesday of mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the lung, commonly caused by asbestos exposure. He also starred in ER and opposite Burt Reynolds in 1974's The Longest Yard. Lauter played a sadistic prison guard whose team squares up to Reynolds' team of misfit convicts in a game of American Football. He also starred in a 2005 remake, starring Adam Sandler. The original landed him a starring role in Alfred Hitchcock's final movie Family Plot in 1976. Last year, Lauter starred with Clint Eastwood and Justin Timberlake in the baseball movie Trouble With the Curve. The actor, who started out as a stand up comic was also famed for his impersonations of movie stars. Lozzi told the Hollywood Reporter: "He called me as Clint Eastwood from the set of Trouble With the Curve last year. We really thought it was Eastwood!" He was also known to do impersonations of black and white stars James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart. Born in Long Island, New York in 1938, Lauter made his Broadway debut in the original 1968 stage production of The Great White Hope, which also starred James Earl Jones. His TV debut was came in a 1971 episode of private eye series Mannix and he made his first big screen appearance in the Western, Dirty Little Billy. Standing at 6ft 2in and prematurely bald with a long, square face, Lauter was often cast as thugs or stern authority figures. He was quoted as saying: "I like those roles. Lee Marvin once told me, 'When you play a heavy, every once in a while make the audience like you a little bit. Then they'll think, 'Wait a minute, he's not such a bad guy. Did you see the way he petted that dog?'" Lauter played the recurring character Dick Healy in the US version of Shameless and had several projects in post-production. A charitable foundation is being established to honour his work and an annual scholarship fund will be awarded to aspiring young actors. His family, which includes four children and his wife of eight years, Mia, have asked that donations be made to the foundation. </body>

      <title>Could Westgate deal a fatal blow to the ICC?</title>
      <description>Could Nairobi siege cause fight against impunity to collapse?</description>

      <body>Western nations backing Kenya's counter-terrorism efforts face a moral dilemma over whether to defer the International Criminal Court (ICC) trial of President Uhuru Kenyatta after last month's Islamist attack on the Westgate shopping centre, write BBC Africa's Solomon Mugera and Moses Rono. The challenge is compounded by the tone coming from Nairobi that strongly suggests that Mr Kenyatta might not turn up for his trial at The Hague in November. Since being indicted on charges, which he denies, of organising violence after the disputed 2007 elections, Mr Kenyatta has consistently said he would co-operate with the ICC. But the reality of what having a president on trial abroad really means struck home when Islamist militants seized the Westgate mall in the Kenyan capital last month, leading to the deaths of at least 67 people. Mr Kenyatta's deputy, William Ruto, was in The Hague in a related case at the time and he had to ask the court for special dispensation to adjourn the hearings and return home. "Suppose Kenyatta was in The Hague attending his trial at the time the siege happened?" a source at the presidency wondered at the time. Independent Horn of Africa analyst Abdullahi Boru views the situation as a conundrum pitting justice against security. "The West faces a dilemma of principle versus realpolitik," he told the BBC. "Do they insist on saying the court should go ahead with the cases, or capitulate to the demands of the African Union (AU) and Kenya?" African leaders have asked the UN Security Council to postpone Mr Kenyatta's trial - they have long accused the ICC of unfairly targeting African leaders. They further asked the Kenyan president and Mr Ruto not to show up for their respective trials until the UN hears the request for a deferral. The UK and France have championed the ICC as a vital tool to help bring to justice those politicians who carry out atrocities in their quest for power and would be loath to undermine the court by agreeing to the AU demand. The US supports that principle but has not signed up to the ICC for fear its own soldiers could be prosecuted. During Kenya's election campaign earlier this year, the UK and the US warned that a Kenyatta victory would have "consequences" for the country. In the event, he turned this around, successfully portraying it as neo-colonial meddling in Kenya's sovereign affairs and was elected president. Even before Westgate, this put the West in a difficult position. Alongside Ethiopia, Kenya is a key ally in counter-terrorism efforts in the region. Nairobi hosts a significant number of African offices for major multilateral organisations, and the world headquarters for the United Nations Environmental Programme. As the biggest, most developed city in East Africa, it is home to a large number of Western expatriates. Kenya also has strong intelligence - and other - links with the US and Israel. As al-Qaeda and its branch in neighbouring Somalia, al-Shabab, have stepped up attacks in the region, both US and Israeli targets in Kenya have been hit by al-Qaeda militants. The UN Security Council is now expected to decide whether to defer the trial of Mr Kenyatta or let it continue - both options entail considerable risks. George Kegoro, the executive director of the International Commission of Jurists-Kenya, told the BBC that extensive lobbying was going on, including a recent visit to Addis Ababa by the 15 Security Council members for consultations with AU officials. In Kenya, the debate is raging. Kenyan law scholar Makau Mutua criticised the AU resolution seeking a deferral of Mr Kenyatta's case. "The message is we can kill; we can maim; we can commit genocide; we can rape our people with impunity and that no court can bring us to account for those crimes," he told Kenya's private NTV channel. While the US-educated Kenyan president is generally known to be easy going and diplomatic, at the AU summit, he lashed out at the court, and the West, leading many to ask whether he would still attend his trial. "The ICC has been reduced into a painfully farcical pantomime, a travesty that adds insult to the injury of victims," Mr Kenyatta said. "It stopped being the home of justice the day it became the toy of declining imperial powers." While campaigning for the March 2013 presidential vote, Mr Kenyatta called his trial at the ICC "a personal challenge". That now appears to have changed. "Once that person is elected into office, there isn't anything personal about him," presidency spokesman Manoah Esipisu told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme. He noted that the Kenyan electorate were fully aware of the charges against Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto when they were elected. "There needs to be a balance between the legal process and his right to govern," he said. In the event that the UN fails to delay his case and Mr Kenyatta opts not to attend his trial, observers believe a warrant of arrest would be issued, turning him, and Kenya, into something of an international pariah, like Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir. Such an eventuality is fraught with serious political risks, including possible destabilisation, which would undermine regional counter-terrorism efforts. "Leadership by Kenya is required to deal with regional instability," Mr Esipisu said, arguing that this was why African leaders had called for Mr Kenyatta's trial to be delayed. If Kenya were to react by withdrawing from the fight against al-Shabab, that would be a massive boost to the Islamist cause in the region. However, Kenya's constitution specifically states that officials indicted by international courts must co-operate, making a boycott difficult for Mr Kenyatta unless the UN Security Council comes to his aid. And the stakes are also high for the ICC. This is by far its biggest case and backing down would deliver a potentially fatal blow to the court, which has been heavily criticised for only delivering one conviction in more than a decade. "In the long-term, the Kenya cases are existential for the ICC," Mr Boru said. "Failure in the Kenyan case will cement the feeling the court, aside from targeting Africans, has also failed to get successful prosecution of big fish." That leaves the UN Security Council trying to square the circle of delivering justice without potentially destabilising East Africa. </body>

      <body>In China - as in many countries - more women than men are entering university. But are there jobs for the girls out in the real world? Manicurist or courtroom judge? Cake decorator or radio host? For the cost of a ticket, children in Beijing can test out dozens of possible careers at the I Have a Dream theme park. But even in this imaginary world, these children - and their parents - stick to rigid gender stereotypes. The most popular attraction for girls is the chance to dress up as flight attendants. After dragging tiny suitcases onto a fake plane cabin, they learn to serve meals from a miniature trolley. "Straighten your uniforms!", the girls are told, as they stand in neat rows, nervously tugging at their sleeves. Many boys choose to work as customs agents or security guards - in costumes complete with fake rifles and mini bullet-proof vests. In China, the idea that girls can't or shouldn't do the same jobs as boys is passed on early. It's a lesson that extends into university and beyond. Six hundred kilometres south of Beijing, at the China Mining and Technology University in China's eastern Jiangsu province, a group of mining engineering students listen intently to their professor. They're the envy of others at this school, since they belong to one of China's so-called "green card majors", courses that all but guarantee employment after graduation. But this program has one clear entrance requirement: men only. "China's labour law suggests mining work is unsuitable for women, so we ask women to refrain from applying to our major," explains one of the department's senior professors, Shu Jisen. This university is not alone. Out of respect for women's safety, it says, China's education ministry bans girls from studying a variety of subjects across China, from tunnel engineering to navigation. At one university in Dalian, northern China, females are barred from studying naval engineering - because months on board a ship would be tough for women to endure, one admissions officer explained to the BBC. Slightly different reasons are given for severely restricting the number of women who can study at Beijing's People's Police University, which has a strict quota, limiting girls to comprise 10-15% of the student body. An admissions officer refused to be interviewed in person. But over the phone, he told the BBC that women were not allowed into the university in large numbers because there were not many jobs open to them after graduation, since most people in China expected police officers to be male. Jiangsu's mining engineering department cites similar practical considerations. Women would not be able to carry heavy mining equipment, they explain, and they would not be able to escape the mine as quickly in an emergency. "Some jobs are really inappropriate for women," Prof Shu argues. "If they force their way into these jobs, they will waste energy that can be better used elsewhere." Some refuse to accept those reasons. A small but feisty network of students and lawyers is fighting the restrictions. Using electric razors, they shaved their heads in series of well-publicised protests across China last year. "It was blatant gender discrimination," argues one of the student activists, Xiao Meili. "No-one had stood up to these universities before, and told them these policies were wrong. Why didn't anyone want to change anything? It really made me very angry." But more are starting to question the ban. In the university lunch canteen in Jiangsu, girls, here to study everything from management to mathematics, can't stomach the restrictions. "If someone can endure tough working conditions, that person should be allowed to do it," explains one student. "Universities should lift the limitations and allow people to make their own choices, instead of just barring them." The activists' network is also battling gender quotas at many Chinese universities that favour boys. In recent years, females across the country scored top marks in China's all-important college entrance exam. But schools want their courses to achieve a balance between genders, so they regularly lower the admissions standards for boys, leaving girls with higher marks out of luck. China's ministry of education insists that it does not allow fixed gender ratios when admitting students, "except for military academies, national defence and public security colleges", according to China's state news agency, Xinhua. But unofficially, the quotas are still in place at many schools, according to the activists. They hope to eradicate all written policies banning girls from applying to any majors, a goal activist Xiao Meili feels they can reach within a year. And hidden prejudice against women in education? That presents a bigger challenge. "Sexism is in every corner of life in China, and people get so used to it that it's easy to ignore it," she says. "People got used to the idea that men did things better than women. But when women started to excel, people got scared and thought of that as a problem." </body>

      <title>Jubilation and suspicion in Iran's press over nuclear talks</title>
      <description>Iran's newspapers react to nuclear talks</description>

      <body>While Iran's reformist dailies are upbeat about the constructive tone of Tehran's latest round of talks with world powers on its nuclear programme, the country's conservative press remains suspicious of Western intentions. However, both camps think that the West should respond to Iran's expressed readiness to compromise by offering concessions of its own. The optimism that followed the negotiations in Geneva is reflected in buoyant headlines splashed across Iran's reformist newspapers. "Luminous lights of Geneva," is Etemad's front page headline above a picture of Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and the EU's foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton standing next to each other. "Nuclear deadlock broken in Geneva," proclaims pro-government newspaper Iran, while Sharq opts for "Geneva smiles". In its editorial, Etemad praises the new government of President Hassan Rouhani and says that Iran wants to open a new chapter in the nuclear negotiations. The paper warns, however, that this should not be interpreted as a sign that Iran was ready to make concessions. Tehran has shown "flexibility", and the West needs to seize this opportunity so that talks could move forward, says Etemad. Writing in Sharq, Gholamali Khoshru, a former member of Iran's nuclear negotiating team, calls for the country's right to develop atomic energy to be recognised. He suggests that in order to facilitate the talks, the West should make a "symbolic gesture" and ease the international sanctions imposed on Tehran. The thought was echoed in the editorial in moderate daily Arman. The paper hails Iran's proposals at the talks as a "positive move", but writes that Iran also needs to see "some concessions" from the other side. Arman also comments on demands that Iran should once again accept the additional protocol to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which would allow unannounced inspections of its nuclear facilities. This "will not be a sign of weakness... it will demonstrate Iran's confidence that its nuclear programme is peaceful," the paper argues. The tone in Iran's conservative papers is more cautious, with some even using a language more reminiscent of the country's previous administration under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. "Western sanctions cannot change Iran's policy," says a defiant headline in Resalat. Qods leads with "Zarif: we will monitor P5+1's change in approach". Keyhan also quotes Iran's foreign minister in order to emphasize a point that the West too must make concessions. "Zarif: America should display good will in practice," says its headline. Keyhan suggests that "instead of offering confidence to the enemy, you have to make them believe that you have the capability, despite all the opposition and hostility, to continue on your path. "The enemy has to believe that the impact of its pressure and its power to exert pressure is not enough to make the other side surrender," the paper argues. For Resalat, the US continues to "direct the scene of the talks and set the rules of the game". The daily warns that many steps have yet to be taken to "untie the knot of the talks".

      <title>Is Brazil the target of industrial espionage?</title>
      <description>Why US security agency is taking an interest in Brazil</description>

      <body>It was not quite the kind of attention Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff wanted to attract to her country's mining and oil riches. Documents leaked by former US National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden in September have suggested that the NSA spied on Petrobras, Brazil's state oil giant. The allegations caused uproar in Brazil, and prompted President Rousseff to cancel her state visit to Washington, where she had wanted to showcase Brazil's energy riches to potential investors. Even though over a month has passed since the allegations were broadcast on Brazil's TV Globo, the United States has so far failed to reassure Brasilia about the aims of its surveillance programme. The report on TV Globo, co-authored by Rio-based US journalist Glenn Greenwald, raised the question whether the NSA might have been engaging in industrial espionage against Brazil. It is an allegation which has been firmly denied by Washington, but one that has touched a sore spot in Brazil. Petrobras is Brazil's largest company and a major source of revenue for the government. It is also developing Brazil's massive deepwater oil reserves. On 21 October, Brazil will auction off the rights to develop the biggest of these new oilfields, Libra, to international companies. So the allegation that the NSA engaged in industrial espionage - and targeted Petrobras in particular - came at the most sensitive of times. But Timothy Edgar, who was the White House director of privacy and civil liberties from 2006 to 2009, believes the rationale for spying on a country such as Brazil could be better explained by the strict rules within which the NSA operates. "I can tell you that the US does not engage in industrial espionage," he told the BBC. "If there were security reasons why intelligence was being gathered in Brazil, it would be legitimate if it was done under a framework [of national security]. "If it was for industrial purposes, it would be basically a violation of US policy," he explained. He says that, in general, the US intelligence agencies' priorities are about preventing international terrorism, curbing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and fighting international drug trafficking. But information about military and political leaders of other countries - especially those perceived as opponents of the US in the international arena - can also be flagged up as intelligence priorities, according to Mr Edgar. Despite a recent warming of relations between Washington and Brasilia, many analysts say it would not come as a surprise if Brazil had been included among these priorities. Brazil has used its strategic assets, including those in the energy sector, to expand its geopolitical sphere of influence and to strengthen its bonds with other emerging powers in the southern hemisphere. In the process, Brasilia has often gone counter to US interests on issues such as the war in Syria and the containment of Iran's nuclear programme. Mr Edgar says that from the point of view of intelligence-gathering, spying on Brazil would make sense if there was a security-related reason, a "legitimate intelligence nexus", for example, to understand the energy supplies within the hemisphere. But it is this "intelligence nexus" which Washington has so far failed to provide. The US intelligence services remained tight-lipped about their reasons for allegedly monitoring Brazil's electronic communications, including those of Ms Rousseff herself. Washington's silence further compounded Ms Rousseff's anger prompting her not only to cancel her state visit scheduled for 23 October, but also to deliver a harsh criticism of the US during the United Nations General Assembly last month. She called the US surveillance programme an attack on the "sovereignty and the rights of [Brazil's] people and businesses". She also dismissed Washington's explanation that its monitoring of communications was for Brazil's own good, saying emphatically that Brazil "knows how to protect itself!". President Barack Obama has promised that a current review of NSA procedures will reassure "allies" such as Brazil, by ensuring that intelligence collected by the secret services amounts to "information that's necessary to protect our people". It is unclear how long the review will take and whether it will reassure Ms Rousseff. But with Mr Greenwald saying he plans to reveal more information about US surveillance practices in the coming weeks, Ms Rousseff's Washington visit seems unlikely to be rescheduled for the near future. </body>

      <title>Silk Road: Will cybercrime evolve?</title>
      <description>Has illegal marketplace Silk Road's demise protected society?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24526677</url>
      <date>1381970464</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70475000/jpg/_70475097_hood.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Silk Road, the infamous online marketplace for drugs and other illegal goods, was closed down by the FBI earlier this month. Since then its alleged founder, Ross Ulbricht - who denies being the site's operator known as Dread Pirate Roberts - has been taken into custody, and police forces around the world have been making arrests. It is a blow to the sale and distribution of harmful substances, including cocaine and heroin, as well as disrupting other criminal activities arranged online, such as the sale of weapons and hitmen for hire. But for how long will society have been made safer? Does it mean the end for illegal marketplaces hidden in the so-called "deep web", which depend on the anonymity provided by the Tor network and the Bitcoin digital currency to attract buyers and sellers? Or is it little more than a minor inconvenience? One man with first-hand experience of FBI takedowns is Emmanuel Gadaix. He was one of the directors of Megaupload, the popular file-sharing website founded by Kim Dotcom that was closed down by the US Department of Justice in January 2012. "This changes nothing in the same way that the closure of Megaupload changed nothing," he says. "All that happens if you bust him [Dread Pirate Roberts] is that two new people come along. "The closure of Silk Road is no more the end of online narcotics sales as the arrest of Al Capone was the end of organised crime." Another man with similar experience is a twenty-something expat Irishman who calls himself H2.0. He is the ex-spokesman for a deep web drugs marketplace called Atlantis, which was closed down by its operators shortly before the Silk Road takedown for "security reasons". Criminals may be more than willing to prey on others, but when it comes to their own dealings they want to feel safe, and H2.0 says Silk Road had managed to build a strong brand in the underworld. "It was a pillar of trust in an otherwise Wild West of dodgy scamsites," he says. But he is sure an alternative to Silk Road will emerge. "We could be in for a period of sites popping up for a few months and closing [just] as fast. Silk Road will be replaced fast but the trust will take longer." Other marketplaces for illegal goods still exist in the deep web - Sheep and Black Market Reloaded (BMR) are two of the better-known ones - and it appears that former Silk Road sellers are already setting up shop in them. "I do know one vendor who was previously one of the top-selling vendors on Atlantis," H2.0 adds. "He moved to Silk Road as soon as Atlantis closed, and two weeks after Silk Road closed he is already set up on Sheep and BMR. "Vendors even seem confident enough to carry forward the same usernames and reputations from Silk Road, which shows they don't seem too worried about being tracked." But security expert Brian Krebs thinks the takedown is significant. "It once again dispels the myth of anonymity on the web, or in this case on the deep web," he suggests. "That's a big deal because clearly many buyers and sellers in this community were under the impression that their actions somehow could not be traced online." In the future, illegal deep web marketplaces are likely to attempt to reassure drug dealers and their customers that their communications with each other are secure by making it easy to encrypt conversations. It turns out that a software package called BitWasp that aims to provide this is already under development, and as an open source project will be available free to anyone who wants it. The man behind BitWasp is known in internet circles as afk11. He currently spends between 30 and 50 hours a week developing it, he tells the BBC. He describes himself as unemployed, 21 years old and from Ireland. Afk11 claims his motivation is to help promote the virtual currency Bitcoin, suggesting it could become a popular way to pay for concert tickets and other events. "Just because people want to remain private doesn't mean things are suspicious," he says. But does he believe that drugs marketplace operators will also use his software? "The short answer would be yes, they probably will," afk11 says. "We're not specifically gearing our project towards the 'dark web' although it will certainly have features which are popular on it, such as PGP encryption. "But it's more important to us that Bitcoin becomes adopted by the masses." The next generation of illegal marketplace operators will be much harder for the FBI or other law enforcement agencies to catch, according to a Bangkok-based security expert and broker of security exploits known as the Grugq. "You can be famous, or a criminal, but you can't be a famous criminal," he says. "[Dread Pirate Roberts] was advertising everywhere and attracting attention - which is never a good thing." He says that the new marketplaces will last longer because the operators won't make the same mistakes. "Each bust works as evolutionary pressure, selecting out the insecure sites and training the other ones what to do better, so there will be better and better services (for buyers and sellers) with each iteration of these marketplaces after each bust," he says. Mr Krebs concurs: "Denizens of these communities will learn from their mistakes... with the result that the up-and-coming communities probably will be more difficult to penetrate and take down." But the Grugq believes that despite the protection and anonymity that Tor, Bitcoin and encryption can provide, many marketplaces and their users will get caught thanks to old-fashioned police techniques. "What you will see with these sites is that as they become higher-profile, undercover agents will infiltrate them as vendors or customers," he says. "They may even work their way into the inner circle and become administrators working for the site." One thing the Silk Road takedown has done is show that operators of illegal marketplaces can and do get caught. And ultimately it's the fear of that happening that may put many people off embarking on a criminal career in the deep web. "I think a legit career move is best for me," H2.0 concludes. "Whoever wants to be the next Dread Pirate Roberts better be able to handle the stress. I didn't like it." </body>

      <title>Young Indonesians work towards political change</title>
      <description>Young Indonesians make effort to challenge political apathy</description>

      <body>Ask Pingkan Irwin what she will be doing on any given Saturday night and her answer is likely to surprise you. Unlike many of her contemporaries, the 28-year-old is not heading out for a night on the town. Instead, this digital marketing strategist is most likely to be found representing the democracy advocacy group she helped to set up, Ayo Vote!, at a trendy Jakarta venue. Ms Pingkan and another friend set up Ayo Vote! - which is Indonesian for "Let's Vote" - in 2010. They felt that young Indonesians seemed politically apathetic, but believed that this stemmed in a large part from ignorance. "Indonesia's younger generation, of which I'm a part, is pretty complacent because in the cities at least, our lives are pretty comfortable right now," she said. "A lot of the time my friends tell me that it doesn't matter whether I vote or not, politicians are all corrupt anyway." Ms Pingkan felt one of the main reasons why young Indonesians weren't getting involved in politics was because they didn't really know what their rights were or what a functional democracy actually looked like, despite the country's relatively recent transition to democracy. "We are basically offering a course in Politics 101 to young voters," she said. "That's why we've set up our website and kicked off this campaign." In Asia, Indonesia stands out as one of the youngest and newest democracies. Fifteen years ago, it was young Indonesians who led the revolution that transformed the country from a dictatorship into the bustling democracy it is now. Indonesia is a remarkably young society, with some estimates saying as much as two-thirds of the population is under 30. That's a significant proportion of the electorate - and political parties are keen to harness their voting power. But many young Indonesians say they are increasingly jaded. They complain that they are fed up with politics and despair of what appear to be rising levels of corruption at every tier of government. Ms Pingkan, however, is not the only one trying to make a difference. Muhammad Iman Usman is also currently working for YCAB - a non-profit group which promotes economic empowerment for women in Indonesia and beyond. He's responsible for raising funds in the US for the organisation. "There are a lot of young people who are doing a lot of exciting things in Indonesia these days to help our community - we just need to create spaces for them to get involved," Mr Muhammad said. "We can't afford to do nothing. The reality is that many politicians in Indonesia are corrupt, but we can't neglect the fact that politics is also an important element in how we live. So we need to get involved and prepare the younger generation for when we are in charge." Marcella Chandra Wijayanti is another person trying to get involved. Eschewing the comforts of corporate life, she spent a year in rural Indonesia, teaching underprivileged children in a programme run by the Teach Indonesia movement, Gerakan Indonesia Mengajar. "When I told my parents and friends that I was going to Rote Ndao in East Nusa Tenggara, they were shocked. Some had never heard of the place before. It's a tiny island, and I'm a city girl!" the 25-year-old laughed. "I graduated as an economics student - I should have been a banker or in finance. But I saw this as a way to pay back to my nation. I was lucky to have a good education, but there are hundreds of thousands of Indonesian children who don't have these opportunities simply because of where they are born." Ms Marcella spent a year in the tiny island community of Rote Ndao, teaching fifth graders and their teachers how to implement the national curriculum properly. "Only 2% of the teachers on the island where I was teaching had graduated from university. That means the majority of teachers were all high school leavers!" she said, still incredulous two years on. The experience profoundly changed Ms Marcella view of her future career path. "I always thought I'd end up in the corporate world. After I finished my stint there though, I joined the Education and Culture Ministry, and my plan is to get a masters in public policy next year. If we youngsters don't help our own country, who will?" That's the same motivation that led Yoga Dirga Cahya to give up a cushy job in Singapore's National Environment Agency and enter politics to try and win a seat in next year's parliamentary elections. The 26-year-old is running for a seat that covers central and south Jakarta, and overseas voters. "I don't believe politics is dirty," he said via telephone from Hong Kong, where he is spreading his message to migrant Indonesian workers. "It's only dirty because the people inside are dirty. If you really want to make a change, then you have to do it from the inside." Having lived in Singapore for nine years, Mr Yoga said he saw the plight of Indonesian migrant workers - in particular maids - first-hand. "I remember telling my local parliamentarians in Jakarta about their misfortunes, but it fell on deaf ears", he said. "So I decided to get involved. Some people may think being young or not politically connected is disadvantageous, but it means I'm free from the past and money politics. It means I can start from a clean slate." But given the fact that the Indonesian parliament has such a bad reputation, is he worried his foray into this field could taint his values? "Sure I worry about that, but we as young people can't stay away from the political world," he said. "Then only bad politicians will join the system." "We need young Indonesians to engage and run the show so that it won't just be the old faces that keep being the only options for us to choose from." </body>

      <title>Norwegian Kenya attack suspect named</title>
      <description>A Norwegian man being investigated over the Westgate terror attacks is Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, the BBC's Newsnight programme learns.</description>

      <body>The man being investigated by Norwegian police over the attack on Kenya's Westgate shopping centre is Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, BBC Newsnight has learned. The 23-year-old Norwegian citizen of Somali origin is suspected of helping to plan and carry out the attack. BBC Newsnight has spoken to a relative of his in Norway who said he left the town of Larvik for Somalia in 2009. At least 67 people died in the attack in Nairobi, which the al-Qaeda linked group al-Shabab says it carried out. Last week Norway's intelligence agency, the PST, said it had sent officers to Kenya to verify reports that a Norwegian citizen had been involved in the assault on the shopping centre, which began on Saturday 21 September and lasted four days. It is unclear how many militants were involved. Police had initially estimated that there were 10-15 attackers inside the complex, but the CCTV footage which has so far been released by the Kenyan authorities shows just four men. Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow is believed to be one of those four, the BBC's Newsnight programme has learned from sources in Kenya and Norway. Dhuhulow was born in Somalia, but he and his family moved to Norway as refugees in 1999. One relative, who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity, said that Dhuhulow left for Somalia in 2009. He made infrequent, increasingly erratic, phone calls to the family, they said, the last one coming in the summer when he said that he was in trouble and wanted to return home. On being shown the CCTV footage of the Kenya attackers by Newsnight, Dhuhulow's relative said: "I don't know what I feel or think... If it is him, he must have been brainwashed." Reporting for Newsnight, Gabriel Gatehouse travelled to the coastal town of Larvik, 120 km (75 miles) south of Oslo, where Dhuhulow's family made their home. Morten Henriksen, one of the family's former neighbours, has not seen Dhuhulow for years. "He was pretty extreme, didn't like life in Norway… got into trouble, fights, his father was worried," Mr Henriksen said of Dhuhulow as a teenager. When shown the CCTV footage of the four Kenya attackers he said that the one dressed in a black shirt or jacket could be Dhuhulow. Stig Hansen, an expert on security and political Islam based in Norway, told Newsnight said that he was not surprised to learn that a Norwegian citizen was suspected of taking part in the attack. He said that an estimated 20-30 Norwegians had gone to Somalia to sign up as fighters for the Islamist militant group al-Shabab. "The biggest problem is the so-called 'Generation 1.5', those who weren't born in Norway, but came when they were quite young, falling between two cultures," he said. "[Al-Shabab] need people who are quite ignorant about Somalia. That is in their interest because that will give them a more internationalist agenda. And it might also make them more dangerous when they return back to their home countries," he added. There have been reports that a Kenyan al-Shabab leader whom US commandos targeted in a raid in Somalia on 5 October, but failed to capture, may have spent time in Norway. Norway's TV2 reported that Abdukadir Mohamed Abdukadir, also known as Ikrima, had travelled to Norway and applied for asylum in 2004 but left in 2008 before there was a decision on his application. Norwegian officials have not commented on the claims. Watch the full report in Newsnight on BBC Two at 22:30 BST on Thursday 17 October and on BBC iPlayer (UK only) </body>

      <title>British Gas raises prices by 9.2%</title>
      <description>British Gas is to increase prices for domestic customers, with a dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November.</description>

      <body>British Gas is to increase prices for domestic customers, with a dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November. The increase, which will affect nearly eight million households in the UK, includes an 8.4% rise in gas prices and a 10.4% increase in electricity prices. The company said it "understands the frustration" of prices rising faster than incomes. The average annual household bill will go up by £123. PM David Cameron has urged consumers to switch suppliers for the best deal. Energy Minister Ed Davey has described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers. Rival SSE has already announced an 8.2% increase in bills from 15 November. On average, customers will see a dual-fuel bill increase to £1,444 a year. However, there are significant regional variations. On average, the biggest increase in a dual-fuel bill is an 11.2% rise in the north of Scotland, in the Scottish Hydro Electric region. The smallest is a 6.8% increase in the south west of England. The company said that the cost of buying energy on the global markets, delivering gas and electricity to customers' homes, and the government's "green" levies, were all factors in the decision to put up prices. "I know these are difficult times for many customers and totally understand the frustration that so many household costs keep on rising when incomes are not keeping pace," said Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas Residential Energy. "We haven't taken this decision lightly, but what is pushing up energy prices at the moment are costs that are not all directly under our control." The company, which operates as Scottish Gas in Scotland, said it made a profit of five pence in the pound after tax. British Gas, the UK's biggest energy supplier, said in May that a profit boost would be used to delay future price rises. This came because customers used 18% more gas in the first four months of the year owing to the cold weather. At the time, a spokesman said: "We will use that [cold weather benefit] to effectively hold prices for as long as possible." Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. Caroline Flint, shadow energy secretary, said: "These latest price rises show clearer than ever why Labour's price freeze is needed." Party leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But the prime minister branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. Mr Cameron also said he was disappointed with the British Gas' announcement. "I would encourage customers who are not happy with the service they're getting, are not happy with the prices, to go to the switching sites online and see whether they can get a better deal," he said. Pressed on whether the government could do more to tackle the underlying issues, Mr Cameron added: "What we can do, which is what we are doing, is to try to get new suppliers into the market." Energy Minister Ed Davey also described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers of British Gas. He questioned the claim that costs imposed by the government were increasing as much as bills and told the Commons that unhappy consumers should consider switching suppliers. However, industry analysts expect other suppliers to announce price rises in the coming weeks, which could affect consumers' switching decisions. "The question now is whether it will be a trickle or a stampede. However, the fact is that households will be struggling to afford to keep warm this winter," said Tom Lyon, of price comparison website Uswitch.com. Ofgem data shows the number of people switching energy companies is at the lowest since records began in 2003. Out of more than 27.7m electricity customers, 658,000 people switched companies in the three months from March to June in 2013, 17% less than the same quarter a year before. For gas, out of nearly 22m customers, 490,000 people transferred over the same three-month period, a 14% decline from 2012. Personal finance commentator and campaigner Martin Lewis said it was important that, if consumers do decide to switch, they should focus on fixed rate tariffs. Because only two of the energy companies have currently put their prices up, those who switch now are likely to be hit with price rises if they switch to another variable rate tariff. He said people can "beat the price hikes" by going to fixed tariffs. Adam Scorer, of watchdog Consumer Futures, said: "We would urge anyone worried about their energy costs to shop around to try to find a better deal and ensure they are on the cheapest payment method, such as direct debit. "There are also some discounted insulation and heating measures available and we would encourage people to take advantage of this to cut their bills." Mr Davey said that British Gas would need to justify its decision "openly and transparently". Many of British Gas's customers made their annoyance at the price rise known during a Twitter question and answer session with customer service Bert Pijls earlier this afternoon. </body>

      <title>US government heads back to work</title>
      <description>US government employees are back at work after President Obama signed a law ending a government shutdown and raising the US debt limit.</description>

      <body>Hundreds of thousands of US government employees are back at work after President Barack Obama signed a law ending a 16-day government shutdown and extending the US debt limit. The cross-party deal came hours before the US government risked running out of money to pay its bills. "There are no winners," Mr Obama said, adding the US would "bounce back". The deal followed 16 days of partial government shutdown, which began when Congress failed to agree on a budget. Congress voted through the deal less hours before a deadline to raise the $16.7tn (£10.5tn) debt limit. The measure approved in Washington funds the government to 15 January, and extends the US Treasury's borrowing authority until 7 February. The deal does not resolve the budgetary issues that fiercely divide Republicans and Democrats. Instead, it establishes a cross-party committee of legislators tasked with crafting a long-term budget deal and reporting back to Congress by mid-December. A faction of Republicans in the hardline Tea Party movement had pushed for the confrontation as a way to gut Mr Obama's healthcare reform. However, Mr Obama and the Democrats refused to negotiate, and the law commonly known as Obamacare escaped relatively unscathed. On Thursday, Mr Obama thanked congressional leaders for their help ending the government shutdown and raising the debt limit, but said both had "inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy". "Nothing has done more to undermine our economy the last three years than the kind of tactics that create these kinds of manufactured crises," he said. Mr Obama said politicians had to stop listening to "talking heads" and activists "who profit from conflict" and instead focus on growing the economy and creating a responsible budget. "The American people are completely fed up with Washington," he said. "How business is done in this town has to change." Mr Obama called the political crises "a spectacle" which had hurt America's credibility in the world. And to the conservative Republicans who pushed the showdown as a way to extract policy concessions, he said: "Go out there and win an election." Politicians, bankers and economists had warned of global economic calamity unless an agreement to raise the US government's borrowing limit were reached. IMF head Christine Lagarde's positive response to the news was tempered by a call for further action. "It will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner," she said in a statement. Economists have estimated the shutdown cost the US economy billions of dollars. The shutdown affected Americans and visitors to the US in countless ways: most national parks were closed, medical research ground to a halt, and ordinary paperwork went unfinished, delaying visa applications, business permits and safety inspections. Hundreds of thousands of employees were put on leave without pay during the shutdown, with many forced to delay purchases or even payment of routine bills. A few days into the shutdown Congress passed a law ensuring they would receive back pay. Before dawn on Thursday, the US Office of Personnel Management, which manages the federal workforce, announced in a terse statement on its website that government workers should return to work as regularly scheduled. A senior manager at the Department of the Interior, which oversees the national parks system and other public land, reminded employees to disable "out of office" email messages, change voicemail prompts, and "check on any refrigerators and throw out any perished food". "We appreciate your sacrifices through these difficult times and we understand that the lapse in government activities has imposed hardships on you, your families, and the people we serve," Rhea Suh, assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, wrote. Federal workers returning to the downtown Washington DC office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were greeted by Vice-President Joe Biden and a welcome note from their boss, agency head Gina McCarthy. A security officer at the building said the shutdown had been "depressing" and had made her realise how much she enjoyed her job. "I enjoy checking in 500 people every day," said Ettereteen Welch. Spurred on by hardline conservatives, congressional Republicans forced the stand-off by linking budget measures to healthcare reform. Despite reluctant support from the House Republican leadership for the bill approved on Wednesday, most of the party's lawmakers in the House voted against it. Republican Congressman Mo Brooks told the Associated Press news agency the law that ended the shutdown merely delayed the fight. "We need to get to the underlying cause of the problem, which is our out-of-control spending and deficits," he said, "and fix it before it's too late and we go down the toilet to bankruptcy. Because that's where America is headed." </body>

      <title>Muslim free school 'dysfunctional'</title>
      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby is criticised by Ofsted inspectors as "dysfunctional" and rated inadequate in every category.</description>

      <body>A Muslim free school has been damned by Ofsted inspectors as "dysfunctional" and rated inadequate in every category - within a year of it opening. An inspection at Derby's Al-Madinah school was brought forward after fears were raised over teaching standards. The report says teachers there are inexperienced and have not been provided with proper training and that the school requires special measures. The school said it accepted the report and would use it to move forward. Reacting to the findings, David Cameron told BBC Radio Derby: "If they don't take immediate action to deal with these things then I think it is right it should close and I think it's absolutely right to intervene rapidly when these things aren't working properly." However, he added: "Let's not use this as a stick with which to beat the whole free school movement - there are now hundreds of schools which have set up as free schools, and on average they have more outstanding and good ratings than established schools. "When it goes wrong - just as with a state school - you've got to get in there and sort it out, or close it down," he said. The Ofsted inspection had been due to take place by the end of the year but was prioritised following initial allegations that female teachers were obliged to wear hijabs and boys and girls were segregated. The school has since written to pupils and staff telling them there is no requirement to cover their hair. Education minister Lord Nash last week warned the school it faced closure unless discrimination against female staff and pupils stopped. A spokesperson said: "We were already investigating this school before allegations became public. We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection. "We have received a response from the Al-Madinah Education Trust as well as a report on the school from Ofsted. Any decisions made will take into account all the available evidence." The Ofsted report found that pupils were given the same work "regardless of their different abilities" and the governing body was "ineffective". It said basic systems were not in place, describing the school as being "in chaos" and "dysfunctional". Boys and girls had different lunch sittings but the report said this was due to the small size of the canteen. Inspectors gave the school the lowest ranking - "inadequate" - in every area, prompting the chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw to call for it to be placed in special measures. This means Ofsted will carry out inspections at the school at short notice to monitor improvements. If poor performance continues the school could be closed. Dr Stuart Wilson, the acting head teacher, said there were "significant and serous problems" at the school and accepted some of the lessons were not meeting necessary standards. "Are special measures a disaster for the school? Yes, they are," said Dr Wilson. "It's not where we want the school to be at this time but we accept the report." In one mathematics lesson, described by Ofsted as "insufficiently challenging", pupils spent the majority of their time cutting out and pasting shapes. Dr Wilson said the school, which has 412 pupils aged between four and 16, had a lot of issues to deal with but he insisted it did have a future. "Obviously the report doesn't make pleasant reading for anybody - we don't want to be in this position - we wish we weren't in this position - but what we need to do now is to accept the report in full and use it to move the school forward." Writing to the school's chair of governors on Thursday, Lord Nash said the Ofsted report was "further compelling evidence of the breaches of the funding agreement I have required you to address". "Contrary to your suggestion that I have acted prematurely, I am even more convinced of the need for very decisive and urgent action on the part of the trust to comply with all your obligations and remedy the serious failings at the school." One parent told the BBC: "I know they are teaching my children well. I'm seeing their progress and I have no concerns at all about the school." Another, Razwana Akbar, said: "I am very angry. They have broken the trust as professional teachers, they have let us down." Chris Williamson, MP for Derby North, said: "Frankly, the position of Al-Madinah school is now untenable and I would fully expect the school to close and for the children to be found alternative places in the council schools in the city." Speaking in Parliament earlier, shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said the Ofsted report was a "devastating blow to the education secretary's flagship policy". He said: "It reveals that pupils have been failed on every possible measure and parents will want to know why the education secretary has allowed this to happen." He described the government's free school programme as a "dangerous free-for-all". "David Cameron and Michael Gove can no longer ignore this issue - it is a crisis entirely of their own making," he said. But speaking at the weekend, Mr Hunt told BBC One's Andrew Marr programme that although Labour would not open new free schools "along the Michael Gove model", the bulk of existing free schools would be kept open as his party wanted to "keep the good free schools". Responding to Mr Hunt's more recent comments, the schools minister David Laws said that the government had taken "swift action" to deal with failings at the Al-Madinah free school told MPs that no school would be allowed to "languish in failure". He also accused Labour of "total and utter opportunism" using the report "to shift its position". </body>

      <title>Hundreds more Madeleine calls</title>
      <description>Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have received more than 2,400 calls and emails since a BBC Crimewatch appeal on Monday.</description>

      <body>Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have received more than 2,400 calls and emails since an appeal on BBC's Crimewatch on Monday. Writing on Twitter, Det Ch Insp Andy Redwood said further appeals on similar programmes in the Netherlands and Germany had led to hundreds of calls. Madeleine, from Rothley, Leicestershire, was three when she disappeared in Portugal in May 2007. Det Ch Insp Redwood has said her abduction could have been pre-planned. Detectives released two e-fits of a man seen carrying a child in Praia da Luz at 22:00 on the night Madeleine went missing and it was revealed that they now suspected Madeleine could have been taken later than previously thought - just before her mother returned to the apartment to check on her. Following his appeal on Crimewatch, Det Ch Insp Redwood travelled to the Netherlands and Germany. Clickable map and timeline He tweeted on Thursday: ""Over 350 people have phoned into the studio of Opsporing Verzocht, Holland and 500 in Germany on Aktenzeichen XY. "Those enquiries are now being assessed and prioritised. Any deemed high being actioned." He added that the police were "very pleased" with the information they had been receiving. The next stage of the appeal will be in Ireland later this month. The Metropolitan Police are offering a £20,000 reward for information. Det Ch Insp Redwood told Crimewatch a number of men had been seen by witnesses in the area on the day Madeleine vanished and one theory was they could have been carrying out reconnaissance. He said they wanted to track down men seen "lurking suspiciously" near the McCanns' apartment. The Metropolitan Police say their inquiries have led to the new timeline and "accepted version of events" surrounding Madeleine's disappearance being significantly changed. The two e-fit images released are of a man a family had seen with a blond-haired child of three or four, possibly wearing pyjamas, heading away from the McCanns' holiday apartment. Det Ch Insp Redwood said he could be the man who took Madeleine - but there could be an innocent explanation. He also said there had been a four-fold increase in the number of burglaries in the area between January and May 2007 and one possible scenario was that Madeleine had disturbed a burglar. Police are also looking at possible bogus charity collectors operating in the area at the time and have released two e-fit images of Portuguese men they would like to identify. Police have also released e-fit images of two men seen in the area around the time that Madeleine disappeared. Two are of fair-haired men who fit similar descriptions. The Portuguese police shelved their inquiry in 2008, but Scotland Yard began a review of the case in May 2011 and opened a formal investigation in July this year. </body>

      <title>Work 'may be no way out of poverty'</title>
      <description>Working parents in Britain no longer earn enough to "escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn warns in his first report.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24553611</url>

      <body>Working parents in Britain "simply do not earn enough to escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn has warned. Two-thirds of poor children are now from families where an adult works, his report found. Many low and middle-income children face being "worse off" than their parents because of falling earnings and rising prices, Mr Milburn added. Wealthier pensioners' benefits should be cut and minimum pay raised, he said. The former Labour health secretary suggested some benefits currently protected from cuts - such as free TV licences and winter fuel allowances for pensioners - could be means tested in order to share the burden of austerity more fairly. But a spokesman for David Cameron said: "The prime minister believes it is right to make commitments to pensioners in relationship to state provision." The government has pledged to safeguard such benefits until the next general election. In its first report, the government's Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission warned the target of ending child poverty by 2020 would "in all likelihood be missed by a considerable margin" - leaving as many as two million children in poverty. Poverty is defined as having a household income that is less than 60% of the national median income. The latest government figures on poverty, released in June, show the median UK household income for 2011/2012 was £427 a week - 60% of that figure was £256 a week. In that year, 17% of children, or 2.3 million, were classed as being in poverty while 15% of working-age adults, or 5.6 million, were in poverty. For pensioners, meanwhile, that figures was 16% - or 1.9 million. The report said Britain still had "high levels of child poverty and low levels of social mobility" with a rising number of children in "absolute poverty" coming from working families. Two thirds of children officially deemed as being poor now came from a family where at least one parent was working - and in three out of four of those cases, at least one of their parents was working full time, the report found. It also said the "twin problems of high youth unemployment and falling living standards" were storing up problems for the future. Among its key recommendations the report urged the government to: "Just as the UK government has focused on reducing the country's financial deficit it now needs to redouble its efforts to reduce our country's fairness deficit," the report said. Single mother Judith Healy, who works from home as a telemarketer, said that, while her wages had not gone up, her expenses had continued to increase. She said she was worried about paying energy bills this winter. "We didn't ask to get in this situation, we are doing the best that we can in the circumstances that we have and that's really what it's about - it's survival now," she told BBC News. Mr Milburn told the BBC: "Today child poverty is a problem for working families rather than the workless or the work-shy." Around five million people in the country, mainly women, were earning less than the living wage, which is about £7.45 an hour outside of London, he said. "These are the people frankly who do all the right things, they go out to work, they stand on their own two feet, they look after their families - they're the strivers not the shirkers - and yet they're all too often the forgotten people of Britain and I think they desperately need a new deal." Mr Milburn said that while ministers and employers could do more, it was unrealistic to expect the government to continue topping up low pay using working tax credits. He advocated a scheme for pairing bright children with the best teachers in an effort to raise attainment. Mr Milburn has previously said social mobility - the idea that individuals can better themselves in terms of educational opportunity, job prospects and salaries from one generation to the next - is "flat-lining". Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg welcomed the report, but warned that "punishing pensioners isn't going to help a single child achieve more in life". Enver Solomon, of the National Children's Bureau charity, said the report was "a wake-up call for all political parties by stating that our country is dramatically polarised between the haves and have- nots". "As the commission states, there is an urgent need to rebalance the distribution of resources so that the burden of austerity is more equally shared," he said. Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said the "powerful report" showed "ordinary families' living standards [were being] squeezed and social divisions [were] deepening as a result of this government's decisions to put a privileged few first". On Wednesday, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed the number of unemployed people in the UK fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million in the June-August period. </body>

      <description>Six British soldiers who died in an Afghan bomb blast claimed by the Taliban were "unlawfully killed on active service", a coroner rules.</description>

      <body>Six British soldiers who died in an Afghan bomb blast claimed by the Taliban were "unlawfully killed on active service", a coroner has ruled. The six men were on patrol in a Warrior armoured vehicle when it triggered a device on 6 March last year. Recording a narrative verdict, Oxfordshire coroner Darren Salter said there was "nothing their comrades could have done to rescue or save them". A series of improvements have been made to Warriors since the incident. Sgt Nigel Coupe, 33, of 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, was killed alongside Cpl Jake Hartley, 20, Pte Anthony Frampton, 20, Pte Christopher Kershaw, 19, Pte Daniel Wade, 20, and Pte Daniel Wilford, 21, all of 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment. The attack, which was so powerful it turned their vehicle upside down and blew off its gun turret, was the biggest single loss of life in an enemy attack for UK Afghanistan forces since 2001. Two Warriors left on a patrol from a base at Lashkar Gah, southern Afghanistan, just after 18:30 local time. Soon after, the Warrior travelling in front triggered a pressure plate which detonated an improvised explosive device (IEDs). A fire broke out almost instantly, setting off ammunition inside the vehicle, the inquest heard. Fellow soldiers tried, in vain, to put out the fire and get into the bombed vehicle. The inquest heard evidence from pathologists who said the men were likely to have been killed or rendered unconscious immediately by the blast. "This, of course, is a tragic loss of these six soldiers and these young lives," Mr Salter said. "At least it is very clear from the evidence of the two pathologists and the evidence of those who witnessed the strike that they did not suffer." He said he was "not going to second-guess decisions of commanders in a courtroom today; that is not the purpose of an inquest". "These are experienced commanders who took decisions on the ground, balancing the risks and exercising judgements," he added. He said it was clear "significant steps" had been taken to improve the vehicles. Oxford Coroner's Court heard on Thursday from Warrior expert Maj Douglas Nelson who said it had been "a very large device - and what I would say is, no vehicle that we had was designed to take that". He said that, while the Mastiff armoured vehicle was specifically designed with improvised IEDs in mind, the Warrior was "infinitely more capable" of fighting at night, when the attack took place. Maj Nelson was among a number of soldiers who told the inquest they felt safest, when on patrol, in a warrior. "Of any vehicle, I would travel in Warrior," he said. "It's as good as we can make it." He said improvements made to the vehicles since the attack included thicker armour, better fire-fighting and detection systems and improvements to ways of getting out in an emergency. Improved fuel tanks were also being fitted to the vehicles, he added. The inquest heard that, when the order was given to leave at 18:00, Pte Kershaw had volunteered to take the place of another soldier, who was just returning from a shower. Speaking after the verdict, his mother, Monica, said it was "a pure quirk of fate that Chris should have been kitted up and got into a patrol for which he was not intended". "I am still struggling with this but how like him to be ready to do his duty for his fellow soldiers," she said. And Emma Hickman, who has battled to prove her fiance, Pte Wade, fathered her daughter before he was killed in the incident, said: "From the struggle to establish Lexie's identity and hearing all the evidence it has been an exhausting ordeal and still we have not come to terms with our loss." The Ministry of Defence released Pte Wade's DNA last year so Ms Hickman could prove paternity and put his name on the birth certificate of their daughter, Lexie-Mai. </body>

      <title>Prince Charles in pensions warning</title>
      <description>The Prince of Wales tells the pensions industry to use a longer-term investing approach or risk a 'miserable future' for the next generation.</description>

      <body>The Prince of Wales has told the pensions industry to use a longer-term investing approach or risk a "miserable future" for the next generation. He warned a National Association of Pension Funds' (NAPF) conference that the current focus on short term investing was "unfit for purpose". Prince Charles said the pensions industry was vital for the economy "now and in the future". The NAPF said it was "pleased" he was "shining a light on these issues." Prince Charles cited "mounting evidence" from Harvard and London Business Schools showing that businesses willing to improve their approach to environmental and social challenges were more likely to deliver long-term returns. The prince said investors had a "duty" to manage risks from rising populations, climate change and "unprecedented levels" of financial indebtedness, he said. He added: "I can only urge you to deploy your considerable human ingenuity to make that innovative and imaginative leap that the world so badly needs." "Otherwise your grandchildren and mine, for that matter will be consigned to an exceptionally miserable future." NAPF chief executive Joanne Segars said sustainability and environmental issues were important to long-term pension fund investors, and were the basis for providing good pensions for people in future. Former pensions adviser to the government Ros Altmann agreed with the prince's comments. She said: "Pensions are meant to deliver long-term value. What we don't want is to get hijacked by the short-term and sell our children's future away." Ms Altmann said it was "clear" that changes needed to be made. "We are living for today in a dangerous way," she said. She said she understood why the short-term focus existed for political reasons, but that pension funds should not be operating on the same timetable. The government will enrol up to nine million more people in pensions during the next five years as fears grow that people are living for longer but not saving for their old age. A spokesperson for Saga, a company that focuses on the over 50s, said Prince Charles was "absolutely right" to speak out. He added: "Whilst the heir to the throne may have a secure future, many of his potential subjects have something altogether less savoury in store for their retirement." </body>

      <title>Blow to multiple human species idea</title>
      <description>The earliest humans from two million years ago in Eurasia and Africa were all part of the same species, refuting suggestions that several distinct types were around at the same time, a study finds.</description>

      <body>The idea that there were several different human species walking the Earth two million years ago has been dealt a blow. Instead, scientists say early human fossils found in Africa and Eurasia may have been part of the same species. Writing in Science, the team says that Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus are all part of a single evolving lineage that led to modern humans. But others in the field reject this. A team looked at the most complete hominid skull ever found which was uncovered in Dmanisi, Georgia. It had a small braincase, large teeth and a long face, characteristics it shares with H.habilis. But many features from the braincase were also unique to H.erectus. The 1.8-million-year old skull comes from a site that has unveiled the biggest collections of well-preserved early human remains known anywhere in the world. They are also the earliest evidence of primitive humans outside Africa, a group which emerged soon after early Homo diverged from Australopithecus, or "Lucy". "We now have the best evidence for what early Homo really is," said lead author David Lordkipanidze from the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi, Georgia. "One of the most important things is that we have such a remarkable collection, it's very rare that you have that from one site." The fossil remains showed a lot of variation which had previously puzzled archaeologists, but Prof Lordkipanidze said it was clear that these features were all from one population. "When we looked at this variability and compared it with modern humans, you can see this is a normal range of variation," Prof Lordkipanidze told BBC News. The skull was uncovered eight years ago and since then the team has compared it to other Homo fossils found in Africa from as early as 2.4 million years ago. Their comparative analysis of the hominid cranium revealed enough similarities for the team to consider the earliest Homo fossils as the same species as the Dmanisi hominids. A co-author of the study, Christoph Zollikofer from the Anthropological Institute and Museum in Zurich, Switzerland, said that if the braincase and the face of "Skull 5" been found as separate fossils at different sites in Africa, they might have been attributed to different species. "That's because Skull 5 unites some key features, like the tiny braincase and large face, which had not been observed together in an early Homo fossil until now." "Furthermore, since we see a similar pattern and range of variation in the African fossil record, it is sensible to assume that there was a single Homo species at that time in Africa," Prof Zollikofer added. "And since the Dmanisi hominids are so similar to the African ones, we further assume that they both represent the same species." Other palaeoanthropologists, however, believe that at least three distinct species of humans co-existed in Africa. They include Fred Spoor from University College London. He told BBC News that the methods of analysis that the team used were not sufficient to infer that these fossils were the same species. "They do a very general shape analysis of the cranium which describes the shape of the face and braincase in broad sweeping terms," Prof Spoor Said. "The problem is that those Homo species are not defined using such a broad overview of what their general cranial shape is." He added that the very specific characteristics that had been used to define H.erectus, H.habilis and H.rudolfensis "were not captured by the landmarks that they used". "They did not consider that the thick and protruding brow ridges, the angular back of the braincase and some details of the base of the cranium are derived features for H.erectus, and not present in H.habilis and H.rudolfensis." Chris Stringer at the Natural History Museum in London said that the team had made an excellent case "that this remarkable new skull, with its huge jawbone", was part of the natural variation of the Dmanisi population. But he said he was doubtful that all of the early Homo fossils can be "lumped into an evolving H.erectus lineage". "Only H.Erectus survives and becomes successful but at the origin nature was experimenting with how to evolve humans in terms of increasing brain size," Prof Stringer told BBC News. "Creatures were starting to use tools and eat meat, and this drove evolution, but I think it also drove diversity. The Dmanisi group is an example of the successful species that came out of that and then carried on to spread around the old world." </body>

      <title>Sleep 'cleans' the brain of toxins</title>
      <description>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins of a hard day's thinking, US researchers have demonstrated.</description>

      <body>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking, researchers have shown. The US team believe the "waste removal system" is one of the fundamental reasons for sleep. Their study, in the journal Science, showed brain cells shrink during sleep to open up the gaps between neurons and allow fluid to wash the brain clean. They also suggest that failing to clear away some toxic proteins may play a role in brain disorders. One big question for sleep researchers is why do animals sleep at all when it leaves them vulnerable to predators? It has been shown to have a big role in the fixing of memories in the brain and learning, but a team at the University of Rochester Medical Centre believe that "housework" may be one of the primary reasons for sleep. "The brain only has limited energy at its disposal and it appears that it must choose between two different functional states - awake and aware or asleep and cleaning up," said researcher Dr Maiken Nedergaard. "You can think of it like having a house party. You can either entertain the guests or clean up the house, but you can't really do both at the same time." Their findings build on last year's discovery of the brain's own network of plumbing pipes - known as the glymphatic system - which carry waste material out of the brain. Scientists, who imaged the brains of mice, showed that the glymphatic system became 10-times more active when the mice were asleep. Cells in the brain, probably the glial cells which keep nerve cells alive, shrink during sleep. This increases the size of the interstitial space, the gaps between brain tissue, allowing more fluid to be pumped in and wash the toxins away. Dr Nedergaard said this was a "vital" function for staying alive, but did not appear to be possible while the mind was awake. She told the BBC: "This is purely speculation, but it looks like the brain is losing a lot of energy when pumping water across the brain and that is probably incompatible with processing information." She added that the true significance of the findings would be known only after human studies, but doing similar experiments in an MRI machine would be relatively easy. Commenting on the research Dr Neil Stanley, an independent sleep expert, said: "This is a very interesting study that shows sleep is essential downtime to do some housekeeping to flush out neurotoxins. "There is good data on memory and learning, the psychological reason for sleep. But this is the actual physical and chemical reason for sleep, something is happening which is important." Dr Raphaelle Winsky-Sommerer, a lecturer in sleep at Surrey University, said: "It's not surprising, our whole physiology is changing during sleep. "The novelty is the role of the interstitial space, but I think it's an added piece of the puzzle not the whole mechanism. "The significance is that, yet again, it shows sleep may contribute to the restoration of brain cell function and may have protective effects." Many conditions which lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease are characterised by the build-up of damaged proteins in the brain. The researchers suggest that problems with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to such diseases, but caution more research is needed. The charity Alzheimer's Research UK said more research would be needed to see whether damage to the brain's waste clearance system could lead to diseases like dementia, but the findings offered a "potential new avenue for investigation". </body>

      <title>Osborne agrees to China nuclear deal</title>
      <description>The Chancellor, George Osborne, announces that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.</description>

      <body>The Chancellor, George Osborne, has announced that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. The announcement also said that Chinese firms might eventually be allowed to take majority stakes in British nuclear plants. Mr Osborne made the announcement on the last day of a trade visit to China. The first China deal could be as early as next week, with the go ahead for a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site. Also on Thursday, a report commissioned for the prime minister warned of a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years. The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits". Supply is expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15. Most existing coal-fired plants are expected to be closed in 2015 to meet European Union pollution directives, while many gas-fired power plants are not being used at the moment because gas is so expensive. These would take time and money to bring back on stream. The Hinkley C project, in Somerset, will be the first new nuclear power station since 1995. Hinkley C's construction will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EDF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs. EDF has been negotiating with three Chinese nuclear giants on the Hinkley C project - CGN, CNNC and SNPTC - all of which have been seen by the chancellor this week. Our business editor, Robert Peston, says he has been told that one or two of these will end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C. A DECC spokesperson said talks about a contract were underway: "Negotiations remain ongoing between the government and EDF on the potential terms of an investment contract for Hinkley Point C. No agreement has as yet been reached. "A contract will only be offered if it is value for money, fair and affordable, in line with government policy on no public subsidy for new nuclear and consistent with state-aid rules." Mr Osborne made the announcement while on a visit to the Taishan nuclear plant in southern China on Thursday which is itself a collaboration between EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG). He said: "Today is another demonstration of the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China, the world's oldest civil nuclear power and the world's fastest growing civil nuclear power." The memorandum of understanding also includes roles for British companies in China's nuclear programme. China has 17 nuclear reactors in operation, which provide about 1% of its electricity production capacity. In the future, Chinese firms might be allowed more than just minority stakes in UK plants. The government said that "over time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes". At the weekend, the Energy Minister, Ed Davey, said he believed that a "massive" wave of investment from China, Japan and Korea would secure UK's power supply into the future. Securing future energy supplies is a major challenge. A portion of energy bills is being diverted to alternative energy investment in wind farms and solar energy. But these, renewable, energy sources cannot provide enough power for the country's energy needs. The industry regulator, Ofgem, has also warned of the "unprecedented challenge" to secure power supplies. It said spare electricity power production capacity could fall to 2% by 2015, increasing the risk of blackouts. </body>

      <title>Teachers' strike closes schools</title>
      <description>Thousands of schools close across much of England as teachers strike over pay, pensions and jobs.</description>

      <body>Thousands of schools were closed across much of England as teachers went out on strike over pay, pensions and jobs. Teachers in London, Cumbria, the South East, North East and South West have been taking part with nearly 3,500 schools shut or partially closed. The action was part of a continuing campaign of regional strikes involving members of the NUT and NASUWT unions. Prime Minister David Cameron said the strike was "inconvenient for parents" and "not good for pupils' education". NUT general secretary Christine Blower, said the union regretted the disruption caused to pupils and parents but teachers felt they had "no other choice". Major rallies have been taking place in Bristol, Durham and London, with smaller events in other areas, including Brighton, Carlisle and Plymouth. Teachers are objecting to proposals by Education Secretary Michael Gove to bring in performance-related pay, increase their workloads and make changes to their pensions. Twenty out of 33 London boroughs provided information to BBC London 94.9 about the number of schools affected. Of those, about 445 schools were completely closed and 450 partially closed. And in Tyne and Wear, at least 471 schools were affected by the industrial action. Head teacher Roberta Kirby, from Fernhurst Junior School, in Portsmouth, said the government had "declared war" on teachers. More than 200 schools in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight were affected by the action. She said: "If we cannot offer good wages and a pension that staff pay into that reflects the work they do, then we are not going to be able to attract the best graduates." Responding to the impact of the strike, some parents said they had found it difficult to find alternative childcare. The BBC's Sarah Ransome said: "People in Plymouth have been telling me that finding alternative childcare because of the strike has been 'quite a headache'." A similar walkout by teachers took place in the east of England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber region on 1 October. Ms Blower said: "Mr Gove has done nothing to address the crisis of low morale in the teaching profession which threatens the continued provision of high quality education." Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said the "overwhelming majority of teachers" were on strike. She said: "Teachers are committed and dedicated public service workers. They do not take strike action lightly. "No teacher has any wish to inconvenience parents or disrupt pupils' education, but this action is not the failure or due to the unreasonableness, of teachers." Plans for a national one-day walkout before Christmas have also been announced by the two unions. Speaking to BBC Sussex, Mr Cameron said responsibility for the strike "lies with the teaching unions". "I think it is very disappointing they have decided to go on strike," he said. "And when we look at the things they are striking over, pensions and pay, they are things that have been decided independently by well-led reviews. "I was at my children's school today in London. One class was not there but the rest of the school was operating. "So, every praise to those teachers who have gone ahead and kept our schools open for our kids." A spokeswoman for the Department for Education (DfE) said 27% of the schools in the affected regions were closed. However, there was no figure available for how many were partially closed. She said: "The NUT and NASUWT have tried to create as much disruption for pupils and parents today as possible. "In spite of this, thanks to many hardworking teachers and heads, only around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed today." </body>

      <title>FA supports Hodgson over 'joke'</title>
      <description>The Football Association says England boss Roy Hodgson has its full support after claims he made an offensive joke.</description>

      <body>The Football Association has given its "full support" to Roy Hodgson after claims a comment made in a team-talk by the England manager caused offence. Hodgson was criticised for referring to a joke about a monkey and an astronaut at half-time in Tuesday's World Cup qualifier against Poland. "He has and deserves the full support of the Football Association," FA chairman Greg Dyke said. Anti-racism campaigners Kick It Out praised the FA's "swift" response. It had called for an investigation into Hodgson's comments but, after the FA confirmed it had not received any complaints from the England players, it now considered the matter closed. A Kick It Out statement read: "We are pleased that the Football Association has investigated this matter swiftly and issued its findings immediately. "If there has been no complaint on the back of the investigation then the matter can only be deemed as concluded. "Kick It Out acts on behalf of the football community at large and when an allegation of a racist or discriminatory nature is made, it's the organisation's role to follow this up." Hodgson was reported  to have referenced the joke when trying to explain to right-back Chris Smalling that he needed to pass the ball to winger Andros Townsend more. The joke, the exact wording of which is still unclear, revolves around an astronaut and a monkey on a Nasa mission. The monkey performs all the tasks requested by mission control, with the punchline being that the astronaut's only role is to feed the monkey. The England manager later apologised and Townsend, 22, tweeted:  "I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken!" Dyke added: "Roy Hodgson is a man of the highest integrity, an honourable man who is doing a great job with the England team. "He has fully explained to us what he said and the point he was making to the players in the dressing room at half-time on Tuesday night. He has also explained the context in which he made his remarks. "He has made clear there was no intent to say anything inappropriate, and he was certainly not making any comments with any racist connotation. Importantly, he has apologised for any unintended offence that may have been taken. "We will be making no further comment on this story and will now be giving Roy and the team our full support as we prepare for the World Cup in Brazil." England striker Wayne Rooney also showed his support for 66-year-old Hodgson on Twitter,  and via his personal website:  "To be honest it's really annoying that something such as this should see the light of day. "All the lads know what type of guy Roy is, and to try and pin some form of label on him is absolutely ridiculous. Roy spoke to Andros straight away, and he took no offence whatsoever. Hopefully that's now the end of the matter." Former England striker Stan Collymore, 42, also defended the former Fulham and West Brom boss on Twitter,  suggesting the row undermines moves to eradicate racism from the sport. "Demeans every anti-racism campaigner by having cheap pop at RH [Roy Hodgson] who said nothing wrong. Makes campaigners seem over-PC and petty. They're not," he said. However, Piara Powar, executive director of Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare), told the BBC that Hodgson had got it wrong. "This was a silly phrase to use in a diverse workforce," said Powar. "I think some players will see it as a reflection of the type of language still used by some coaches and some attitudes that still prevail." </body>

      <body>Defending champion Jorge Lorenzo has backed Marc Marquez to dominate MotoGP "for many years". Marquez, 20, can win the title at the Australian Grand Prix on Sunday following a stunning debut season. He holds a 43-point lead over Lorenzo and will be champion if he takes eight points more than his fellow Spaniard. Lorenzo said: "He will not only be world champion this year but maybe for many years. He is talented, fast, ambitious and brave." Yamaha rider Lorenzo has won five races this season but has been unable to match the consistency of Marquez, who has won six times and finished on the podium in every race bar one. Lorenzo said: "We have been watching one of the most incredible riders that has come into a new category in history. "Obviously you need to have all the cards in your hands and he has this with a very good team, bike and sponsor. The tyres are easier than before and everything together makes him so competitive. "It is because he is a phenomenon, but he also has the best tools he can have." With 75 points still to play for, Marquez looks certain to win the title and become the first rookie to take the championship since Kenny Roberts in 1978. But he admits that he did not expect to be challenging in his first season. "I didn't expect to be this strong to be honest. In my best dreams it was impossible to think that," he said. "I expected to be competitive and in my best dreams it was to try and be third." </body>

      <body>England will not be one of the top eight seeds at next year's World Cup in Brazil after sealing qualification with a 2-0 win over Poland on Tuesday. Fifa's latest world rankings determined the top seeds for the 2014 tournament. England who climbed from 17th to 10th, will now have to face one of the top-ranked nations in their group matches. But boss Roy Hodgson says he is not worried whether his team is "first or second out of the hat" when the draw takes place on 6 December. The Netherlands, who were runners-up in 2010, and 2006 winners Italy are also unseeded. But Switzerland, Belgium and Colombia are, following the release of the rankings on Thursday by football's governing body. Hosts Brazil and the remaining top seven ranked qualifiers will be kept apart in the group stages of next year's tournament. Those groups will be completed by teams from three different geographical regions. England will have to face one of Brazil, Spain, Argentina, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Colombia and probably Uruguay. Uruguay's place in Brazil depends on them winning a play-off against Jordan, ranked 70, next month. If they are beaten in the two-legged tie, the Netherlands will take the final seed ahead of Italy. The rankings' emphasis on recent results rather than teams' record in major tournaments means 2010 World Cup runners-up Netherlands and 2006 winners Italy miss out on being kept apart from the other traditional powerhouses of world football. Barring a slump down the Fifa standings for any of the three, the Netherlands, Italy and England are likely to be kept apart as high-ranked fellow European nations. France coach Didier Deschamps, whose side have to win a two-legged play-off to make the finals after finishing second to Spain in their qualifying group, has criticised the system. "From my point of view it's not very logical,'' said the former Chelsea midfielder. He added that it was a "double punishment" that his side were in Group I, the only European one with five rather than six teams, meaning they had two fewer matches to earn ranking points. As well as a seed and an unseeded European qualifier, each of the World Cup groups is likely to be completed by a team from a combined Asia, Oceania and North and Central America pot and one of the unseeded African and South American qualifiers or the lowest-ranked European qualifier. Spain remain at the top of the rankings, ahead of Germany who leapfrog Argentina to take second spot. Scotland have climbed 28 places to 35th in the world after beating Croatia and Macedonia in the final two games of their unsuccessful qualification campaign. Wales are up eight places to 44th in the wake of their 1-1 draw with Belgium, while Northern Ireland drop four places to 90th following their 1-1 draw away to Israel. </body>

      <description>Recovering from a surprising miss last quarter, Google reports a profit of $2.97bn (£1.84bn) during the July -September period, beating expectations.</description>

      <body>Google has reported a profit of $2.97bn (£1.84bn) during the July -September period, beating expectations. The company missed forecasts during the last quarter. However, a closely watched measure, cost per click - how much advertisers pay to place an advert - declined by 8% from the same period last year. Google boss Larry Page said a statement that: "Google had another strong quarter with...great product progress". Shares in the company jumped to an all time high in after hours trading. Overall, paid clicks increased by 28% from the same time last year, and were up 8% from the previous quarter. This is taken as a good sign by analysts, as advertising makes up the dominant share of Google's profits. The company's troubled Motorola unit continued to be a drag on the figures, however. It lost Google $248m, despite the launch of the flagship Moto X phone in August. Mobile battle In a call to discuss earnings with investors, Mr Page highlighted just how dominant mobile has become among consumers. He said that 40% of users reached YouTube through their mobile phones compared to just 6% two years earlier. Analysts were closely watching how Google is faring in this mobile transition, particularly as it relates to advertising. Google charges less for mobile than for its traditional web browser ads, which is why even though ad sales increased throughout the quarter, the cost per click figure declined. Research firm eMarketer estimates that the mobile ad market worldwide will grow 89% to $16.65bn this year; up from $8.8bn in 2012. Google's market share in the ad market is $6.9%. This has recently slipped slightly as rival Facebook has made inroads. Facebook now has 14.9% of the market, a jump from 9% last year. In a personal move, Mr Page said that he would no longer be participating in every earnings call. While he said this move was intended to better prioritise his time, many observers noted that his voice remained strained after surgery to repair an injured vocal chord. </body>

      <body>Home Office vans telling illegal immigrants to "go home or face arrest" could be "rolled out" across the UK, a minister has said. Mark Harper told BBC One's Question Time the government was assessing the results of the scheme, which was piloted in London. The Liberal Democrats have ruled out agreeing to use the vans in future. But Mr Harper, the Tory immigration minister, said he did not "have any problem" with the overall message. During July, vans were driven around the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow for a week. A poster on the side displayed a picture of handcuffs and read: "In the UK illegally?... GO HOME OR FACE ARREST." Some critics complained that the tone was reminiscent of language used by the National Front in the 1970s. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said the campaign had been "stupid and offensive". And his party colleague, Home Office minister Jeremy Browne, who has since lost his job, said the Lib Dems would not "be agreeing any proposals to bring them back". Earlier this month, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned the posters, saying they had misled the public about the arrest statistics displayed. However, it cleared the campaign of being offensive and irresponsible. Mr Harper told Question Time the general message had not been wrong. He said: "I don't have any problem with saying to people who are here illegally that they shouldn't be here anymore." He added: "It's a pilot. We are assessing the results at the moment." Mr Harper also said: "We are going to publish the results when we have done the evaluation. If it's successful, we will roll it out. If it's not, we won't." </body>

      <body>Even their political opponents no longer challenge the SNP claim that Scotland was one of the wealthiest countries in the world, said the deputy leader of the SNP, just before the opening of her party's conference. Nicola Sturgeon spoke to Andrew Neil about the polls, which suggest a win for the no campaign, but said: "If we can get our arguments right and pitch them properly, then those polls can be turned and I believe that is what will happen." And she said it was "absolutely right and proper" there was a TV debate between Alex Salmond and David Cameron and she called on the prime minister to change his mind, and asked: "What is he running scared of?" As the party gathers in Perth, Ms Sturgeon said: "We have got work to do at the conference, and beyond, to convince the people in Scotland that we can more than afford to be an independent country."

      <description>The qualifications of adults now in their 40s, 50s and 60s were as much influenced by social background as intelligence, a long-term study finds.</description>

      <body>The level of qualifications achieved by adults now in their 40s, 50s and 60s was influenced by social background as much as their own intelligence, according to a long-term study from the University of Oxford. It found that children of the same ability went on to achieve very different levels of exam results. Academics tracked 5,000 people in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It comes as a report on social mobility is about be published. The study, from Oxford University's Department of Social Policy and Intervention, examined the academic achievements of cohorts of people born between the late 1940s and 1970. Their academic results as young adults were compared with cognitive ability tests taken when they were aged between 10 and 13. It showed that children from wealthier and better educated families had been much more successful in exam results than poorer children of a similar intelligence level. It meant that many poor, bright young people leaving school in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s failed to reach their full potential. Among the youngest of this survey, leaving school in the mid-1980s, fewer than one in five went to university. Among the oldest group, who would have left school in the early 1970s, only about one in 20 reached degree level. Last week figures from the OECD think tank indicated the 55-65 age group in England had stronger literacy and numeracy skills than 16-24-year-olds, even though the younger group had much better qualifications. The OECD has warned about the diminishing job prospects for those without skills. And this study shows the long roots of the academic gap between rich and poor and the lack of social mobility in education. What surprised the Oxford University researchers was that a parallel study in Sweden, across the same decades, also showed a strong link between economic background and academic achievement. The lead author of the study, Erzsebet Bukodi, said there were expectations that Sweden would have had more equal outcomes, but the results showed that poorer children were also disadvantaged there. Co-author, Prof John Goldthorpe, said the results showed that Sweden was not "significantly ahead" in terms of a meritocratic system and he said it raised questions about whether educational policies could be used to promote social mobility. Dr Bukodi also highlighted how the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s were decades of great social change, with a perception of increased social mobility, but the studies in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland and Sweden showed a sustained picture of a social gap in exam results. Across three decades there had been no diminishing of this link between social background and achievement, said Dr Bukodi. Despite the lack of a level playing field, it still remained possible for bright children from poorer backgrounds to out-perform those who were from wealthier backgrounds, but with less intelligence. But it was an uphill struggle. The study suggests that among the cleverest children born in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland in 1970, in the top fifth of the ability range, 80% of the richest children achieved two A-levels or their equivalent, compared with only 40% for the poorest. It meant that for poor children with high levels of intelligence, a majority left school in the 1980s without two A-levels. "We see that in both the British and Swedish educational systems, even the very brightest children are hampered if they come from a disadvantaged background," said Dr Bukodi. "It is possible of course that clever individuals choose other ways of getting on in the world than through education, but the fact remains that many children in British and Swedish schools do not appear to fulfil their academic potential." </body>

      <description>Microsoft has released the Windows 8.1 update for its flagship operating system.</description>

      <body>Microsoft has released the Windows 8.1 update for its flagship operating system. The download seeks to address some of the criticisms levelled at the original version of Windows 8. In particular, the update restores the start button and allows a computer to boot up with a traditional desktop interface. The launch comes at a critical time for Microsoft as it seeks a new boss, with PC sales experiencing a long decline. Windows 8 sought to bridge the gap between touchscreen devices, such as tablets and smartphones, and more traditional form laptops and desktop machines. As such it had an interface built of tiles that could be tapped or swiped to open applications. However, many people found the tiled interface did not work well for some of the things they were used to doing with a computer. The changes in 8.1 include: A host of other changes, including better support for multi-tasking and improved links to Microsoft's Xbox game console, are also in the update. Windows 8 was created to capitalise on the growing popularity of tablets and other portable gadgets. Microsoft needs to get people using its software on these machines because sales of desktop machines are in sharp decline. Global shipments of PCs hit a five-year low in early October, according to figures from market research firm Gartner. Sales of PCs had now fallen for six quarters in a row, it added. The downward trend in sales statistics were confirmed by IDC, which added that the decline would probably continue into 2014. The shrinking sales are important for Microsoft because traditionally the bulk of its revenue comes from people and companies buying laptops and desktops and office software to run on them. It is not clear that Microsoft is adjusting to the changes in the types of gadgets that people use. In July, Microsoft was wrote off $900m (£559m) following poor sales of its own-brand Surface touchscreen devices. At the same time, Microsoft has undergone a major reorganisation and has bought phone maker Nokia. It is also launching a new version of its Xbox games console and has begun searching for a new chief executive. Servers ready to dispense the update were turned on at 07:00 New York time (12:00 BST). The update is free to those already running Windows 8. Charges will apply if users upgrade to 8.1 from Windows 7. The update comes just over a year after the launch of Windows 8. </body>

      <body>Despite being home to about 16,000 tree species, just 227 "hyperdominant" species account for half of Amazonia's total trees, a study suggests. An international team of researchers found that the region was, in total, home to an estimated 390 billion trees. Writing in Science, they added that the rarest 11,000 species made up only 0.12% of tree cover. However, they added that the new data could help unlock ecological secrets held by the biodiversity hotspot. The results were based on a survey of 1,170 plots and half-a-million trees across the six-million-square-kilometre area, often described as the lungs of the world. The authors said that the underlying cause of the hyper dominance of the 227 species, which accounted for 1.4% of the estimated number of species in the region, remained unknown. "We knew that, normally, a few species dominate ecosystems, but if you have a system that has 16,000 tree species but just 227 make up half of the trees, that was pretty surprising even for us," said lead author Dr Hans ter Steege from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands. He told the Science podcast: "We don't really know why these species are so incredibly dominant because they do not have any particular ecological feature that stands out." In the paper, Dr ter Steege and the team of more than 100 scientists wrote that there was no evidence that two key functional traits for trees - seed mass and wood density - played a part in determining what species dominated the landscape. "The 227 hyperdominant species include both shade-tolerant, typically large-seeded climax species with dense wood and shade-intolerant, small seeded pioneer (species) with light wood," they observed. The most dominant species was indentified as Euterpe precatoria, a palm tree native to central and southern America, with a mean estimate population of more than five billion individuals within Amazonia. Conversely, the researchers noted that the rarest 5,800 species had communities with fewer than 1,000 individuals, adding: "which is sufficient to classify those that are endemic as globally threatened". They suggested further analysis would show that the species identified as hyperdominant would be "disproportionately resistant to pathogens, specialist herbivores and other sources of frequency-dependent mortality". Dr ter Steege said the data could also be used by conservationists to find out what species were found in protected areas, such as national parks, and what ones were located in unprotected areas, and were therefore vulnerable to threat such as deforestation. </body>

      <body>American film director Michael Bay has been injured in an attack in Hong Kong while filming on the set of his latest Transformers film. Two men have been arrested on suspicion of blackmail and assault after they demanded money from the film crew, police have said. Mr Bay, 48, received injuries to the right side of his face. But he declined to seek treatment and continued filming in a busy area of Hong Kong island. A local newspaper in Hong Kong reported that three men caused what it called "a huge disturbance" to the filming of the American science fiction film. It said that the men could have missed out on disturbance fees which the film crew paid to shop and business owners whose businesses were likely to be affected during filming. The two men approached Mr Bay on the set during filming, a police spokeswoman told Reuters. One of them demanded payment of HK$100,000 ($12,900; £8,030). As the discussion continued, the man assaulted Mr Bay and also attacked three police officers who tried to intervene, police say. The officers received treatment at hospital for minor injuries. Police also arrested a third man at the scene. There has been no comment from Mr Bay or his crew on the incident. The fourth instalment of the Transformers franchise starring Mark Wahlberg and Nicola Peltz is scheduled for public release in June 2014. Hong Kong's striking Victoria Harbour is believed to be among the film's locations, along with the city's dense and bustling streets. </body>

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the country's most common mental health problems.</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <body>Somalia has one of the highest rates of mental illness in the world and with a healthcare system devastated by years of war, most sufferers receive no medical help. Many are chained up - to trees or at home. Some are even locked in cages with hyenas. But one man is trying to change all that. Dr Hab's advert runs up to three times a day on Mogadishu's radio stations. "He's gone crazy! He's running away!" screams the actor. "Chain him down!" The scenario is familiar in Somalia. A man has become possessed by spirits and the only option for his family is to restrain him and call the sheikh. But as the young man protests, a voice that challenges Somali tradition booms out. "Stop with the chains!" the voiceover orders. "Take him to Dr Hab's hospital! If he's having mental problems, take him to Dr Hab. He won't chain him, he'll help him." Dr Hab is not actually a real psychiatrist. Rather it's the persona of Abdirahman Ali Awale, a nurse who after three months of specialist training from the World Health Organization (WHO), has made it his mission to rescue Somalia's mentally ill. He claims he is able to treat everything from post-natal depression to schizophrenia. But the alternative to a trip to Hab could be a visit to one of Somalia's popular herbalists or sheikhs who still advocate traditional - and sometimes barbaric - cures. "There is a belief in my country that hyenas can see everything including the evil spirits people think cause mental illness," says Hab. "So in Mogadishu, you will find hyenas that have been brought from the bush and families will pay £350 ($560) to have their loved one locked in the room overnight with the animal." The expensive treatment - more than the average annual wage - is as brutal as it sounds. By clawing and biting at the patient, the hyena is thought to force the evil spirit out. Patients, including young children, have been known to die during the process. "We are trying to show people that this is nonsense," says Hab. "People listen to our radio advert and they learn that mental illness is just like any other and needs to be treated with scientific methods." Hab's campaign was prompted by an incident in 2005 when he witnessed a group of female patients being chased through the streets by youths. "There was no-one to help them," he says. "I decided after that I would have to open Somalia's first mental hospital." The Habeb Public Mental Health Hospital in Mogadishu became the first of Hab's six centres across Somalia. Together, they have now treated over 15,000 patients. There were only three practising psychiatrists in the whole of Somalia at the last count, and Hab - despite his lack of advanced qualifications - is head of what has become the country's leading provider of mental health services. He even carries a letter from the minister of health that says so. Hab faces a near insurmountable task. WHO estimates that one in three Somalis either is or has been affected by mental illness, compared to a global average of one in 10. In parts of the country, where the population has been the most psychologically scarred from decades of conflict, the rate is even higher. Cases of post-traumatic stress disorder are common and the situation is further complicated by widespread substance abuse. "Khat is a big, big problem," says Hab of the herbal stimulant which has been chewed for centuries in East Africa. Side effects are thought to include anxiety and even psychosis. "We treat them in the hospital and they leave, but then they start eating khat again. Sometimes I see the same patients seven or eight times." Western aid agencies in Somalia have often promoted projects targeting communicable diseases, not least because results are quicker and cheaper to obtain. Hab, meanwhile, says he is left to run his organisation with minimal resources and an erratic supply of psychotropic medicines that he sources from NGOs and private pharmacies. Even getting sufferers to recognise that their condition constitutes an illness is difficult. Psychological problems are more likely to be reported by Somalis as physical pain - headaches, sweating, and chest pain. Some concepts of mental illness do not even exist in Somali culture - depression, for example, translates as "the feelings a camel has when its friend dies". But nothing is more indicative of the population's poor understanding of mental health than the widespread practice of chaining-up sufferers to trees and in rooms. GRT, an Italian NGO, has documented sufferers who have been chained up their entire life. "I myself have saved many patients who have been left to die," says Hab who drives a minibus into rural areas, unchaining people and taking them to one of his centres. "Parents, siblings, relatives - they've just been chained up to a tree and the family has gone." The WHO has funded a "Chain Free Initiative", with the aim of eradicating the practice altogether, starting with the use of chains in hospitals. But even Hab admits to having chained up some of his most aggressive patients. He tells the story of how, in 2007, one unintended consequence of his acquisition of a batch of the anti-psychotic drug, fluphenazine hydrochloride, was an increased appetite in his patients. They took to scaling the walls of his hospital in Mogadishu to scavenge for food. But still desperately unwell, some of the escapees had been shot when they ignored orders at a military checkpoint. Chaining them to their beds, concluded Hab, was the only option. "Many patients take a long time to treat," he says. "There has been no outside help focussed on treating mental health problems and the main reason NGOs are not getting involved is because of the expense." Hab is motivated by the thousands of patients he believes remain chained up in private homes. He sends through a spreadsheet showing what he needs - new mattresses, food for patients, and diesel for his minibus. There is also a shortage of qualified psychiatrists and nurses. The daily struggle to provide for his patients and the suffering he witnesses is clearly taking its toll. "Physiologically and mentally it's a very hard job" he says. "I was healthy when I started, now I suffer from diabetes. I am dealing with big, big problems all by myself. "I have cried on TV, I have cried in public places, I have cried in front of presidents," he says. "Even now I feel like crying." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Ex-BBC man guilty of sex attacks</title>
      <description>Ex-BBC Radio Norfolk broadcaster Michael Souter is found guilty of historical sex attacks on boys.</description>

      <body>A former BBC radio presenter described as a "dominant predator" has been found guilty of sexually abusing boys. Ex-BBC Radio Norfolk and Radio Clyde broadcaster Michael Souter, 60, was convicted of 19 sexual assaults on seven boys aged between 11 and 16. Souter was a Venture Scouts leader, a volunteer mentor to young people and was even allowed to adopt a child. Judge Mark Lucraft warned him he faced "a long period of imprisonment" when he is sentenced on 31 October. Souter, of Loddon, Norfolk, stared straight ahead without emotion as the judge spoke. The jury at Norwich Crown Court also found him guilty of seven counts of making and possessing indecent images of under-18s, after a six-week trial. He faced two more counts of possessing indecent images of a child, but was cleared of one and the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict on the other. He was remanded in custody. The court heard Souter used his celebrity status to abuse his victims. He carried out the attacks between 1979 and 1999. The jury of nine men and three women took three hours to reach their verdicts. After the trial, detectives revealed they were investigating further allegations of abuse against Souter. Norfolk Police confirmed a "live inquiry" was continuing into outstanding claims. A total of 595 people have been identified as witnesses and it is understood a number have raised concerns about his behaviour. Det Insp Paul Brown, of Norfolk police's child abuse investigation unit, said Souter had shown no remorse. "In the trial the evidence was overwhelming and he denied what had appeared to be really obvious," he said. "There's no doubt in my mind his interaction with different agencies and organisations was based around the persona that he had around the county. "He used that to ingratiate himself into situations to allow him to offend." Sheila Lock, interim director of children's services for Norfolk County Council, said that when Souter first volunteered as a mentor for vulnerable youngsters, he underwent a "robust" assessment before he was allowed any contact with children. "No concerns were raised through police checks, interviews or references," she said. When abuse allegations came to light in 1993, the council took them "extremely seriously", she added. "We worked alongside police to investigate the concerns and took appropriate protective action to safeguard the children Souter had had contact with. "Souter was clearly a manipulative and predatory man and it is right that he will now serve many years in prison, having added to his victims' suffering by forcing them to give evidence. "Souter's victims have shown incredible courage in coming forward after so many years and today's verdict proves it is never too late to speak out." Chris McCann, head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) complex casework unit for the East of England, said: "Michael Souter presented himself to people as a local celebrity from radio and television, happy to be involved in charity events, the Scout movement and as a youth mentor for Norfolk social services. "All this was a smokescreen to hide his true intention: to become close to young boys so he could sexually abuse them, confident that his celebrity status would mean they would not be believed." A BBC spokesman said: "The crimes that Michael Souter has been found guilty are truly shocking and the BBC condemns them in the strongest possible terms. "Michael Souter has not worked for the BBC since the early 1990s." A spokesman for the Scout Association said Souter had not been a member for 25 years. "The Scout Association condemns the actions of Souter and is pleased that the judicial process is now complete and he will now be punished for his crimes," he said. The association had co-operated fully throughout this case, he added. "We can confirm that he will never be allowed to work within the Scout Movement again," he said. </body>

      <body>A school which let pupils as young as 11 smoke in the playground has been ordered to stop the practice. Leeds City Council education bosses stepped in after learning children at Elmete Central School in Roundhay, Leeds, were allowed to smoke. It is understood cigarettes were confiscated at the start of the day but returned at break times in an attempt to stop pupils playing truant. Elmete caters for 75 pupils with educational and behavioural issues. Paul Brennan, deputy director for children's services, said the council spoke with the school's recently-appointed head teacher Lesley Boyd as soon as it was made aware pupils were smoking on the premises. He said he was now "confident" the practice had ceased. "The recently-appointed head teacher has agreed to review any such practices, and to make sure this does not happen in the future we will conduct unannounced visits by local authority staff," he said. "We have a strict no-smoking policy in all of our schools and encourage them to promote healthy lifestyles to all pupils." A council spokesman added that Lesley Boyd was not the head teacher at the time the policy was introduced. </body>

      <title>Scottish Gas rise hits north hardest</title>
      <description>Scottish Gas customers in the north of Scotland are facing higher fuel bills than the rest of the UK, following a move by the energy firm to increase prices.</description>

      <body>Scottish Gas customers in the north of Scotland are facing higher bills than the rest of the UK, after a decision by owners Centrica to increase prices. The price rise will see an average UK dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November. But regional differences mean domestic customers living north of Perth will see an average rise of 11.2% - the biggest in the UK. Customers in the south of Scotland will see an average increase of 9.5%. The smallest rise is a 6.8% increase in the south west of England. Scotland's electricity transmission network is split between Scottish Hydro in the north and Scottish Power which holds the licence for central and southern Scotland. Centrica, which owns the British Gas and Scottish Gas brands, said its regional price differences reflected variations in the network costs it was obliged to pay to the transmission companies around the country. Rival SSE has already announced an 8.2% increase in bills from 15 November. The Centrica move, which will affect nearly eight million people in the UK, includes an average 8.4% rise in gas prices and a 10.4% increase in electricity prices. The company said it "understands the frustration" of prices rising faster than incomes. The average annual household bill will go up by £123. On average, UK customers will see a dual-fuel bill increase to £1,444 a year. Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. Energy regulator Ofgem said prices were determined by suppliers competing in the British energy market and it was up to them to justify their prices and profits to consumers. An Ofgem spokeswoman said: "Any price rise will not be welcomed by customers which is why it is important that Scottish Gas fully explain the reasons for the increase. "Energy suppliers should be doing all they can to minimise the impact of these rising costs on energy bills by ensuring they are managing their costs as efficiently as possible. "Suppliers must also ensure they are giving customers all the advice and help they need to save money on their energy bills, for example through energy efficiency." </body>

      <title>Salmond holds Grangemouth talks</title>
      <description>Scotland's First Minister is holding talks with both sides involved in the dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant.</description>

      <body>Scotland's first minister has been holding talks with both sides involved in the dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant. It is understood Alex Salmond earlier spoke to officials from the plant's operators Ineos. Mr Salmond confirmed in his opening address at the SNP conference in Perth he would hold further talks with both Ineos and the Unite union. The facility remains shut down despite Unite calling off a planned strike. The first minister told delegates at the SNP conference that officials from both Ineos and Unite had been quoted in the media as saying they believed Grangemouth had a "great future". He added: "What I will attempt to do is to take and build on that belief, and say to both Unite and Ineos that only by negotiation, cooperation and agreement can we get an effective resolution. "We believe, and Scotland believes and expects, that Grangemouth as an industrial facility has a great future." Mr Salmond left the first day of the conference in Perth for the discussions in Edinburgh. "Governments can't make agreements" in such disputes but can "encourage the circumstances in which agreements can be found", he told party delegates. Ineos said shutting down the Grangemouth complex had cost the company £20m so far. However, it reported that its power station at the site - which supplies steam to a neighbouring North Sea pipeline system - was continuing to operate despite the shutdown. The company said fuel was still being sent by tanker from Grangemouth to filling stations in Scotland and the north of England and that stocks of refined fuel at the site remained high, with more being brought in. Ineos has put proposals over pay and pensions to workers at the complex, which has 1,400 employees and many more contractors. A letter outlining the proposed changes was being couriered to employees on Friday. BBC Scotland has been given details of the offer, which includes freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016. The shift allowance would also be reduced from £10,000 to £7,500 per year, while pensions would be transferred from a final salary to a defined benefits scheme. The company added that no job cuts were expected. It has asked for an answer to the proposals by Monday, and has said shareholders will discuss the complex's future on Tuesday. The company has said Grangemouth is "financially distressed" and must reduce costs. It has also asked for guarantees that no further strike action will be held by workers. Unite claimed the company had told staff they could lose their jobs and be reemployed on poorer terms unless they agreed to give up their final salary pension, and accept pay freezes and pay cuts, by 18:00 on Monday. Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scottish secretary, said: "This is cynical blackmail from a company that is putting a gun to the heads of its loyal workforce to slash pay, pensions and jobs. "We are considering taking legal action over the company's menacing tactics and urge members not to be threatened into signing their livelihoods away. "It is increasingly clear that the company is deliberately generating a dispute and hiding behind fancy accounting to attack its own workforce." On Wednesday, Ineos said Grangemouth "is shut and remains shut", despite Unite calling off a 48-hour strike that had been due to begin on Sunday. The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans. Ineos claims it is unable to immediately restart the complex, which had been shut down ahead of the planned strike. A spokesman said: "The Grangemouth site is three times the size of the City of London and it is an incredibly complex system of manufacturing plants all connected by miles of pipes carrying highly flammable materials. "Shutting down the site and restarting again is not like switching the lights off and on. It takes days to shut down properly and it takes weeks to bring it back up again. "When Unite forced us to shut down in 2008 we had two major incidents and it took eight weeks to get back to normal. In the first incident, we had a large fire on a compressor. If our employees had been close to the area then there would have been serious injuries or even fatalities." </body>

      <body>A stone was discovered lodged in County Armagh student Natasha McShane's throat following a random street assault in Chicago, a court has heard. Ms McShane's injuries were so serious that a brain surgeon was immediately told of her admission to hospital. Heriberto Viramontes is accused of the attempted murder of Ms McShane and her friend Stacy Jurich in April 2010. Ms McShane has been left with extensive brain injuries after being hit with a baseball bat. She has also struggled with her speech and mobility. The Cook County Criminal Court in Chicago heard evidence on Thursday from the trauma surgeon on duty in the emergency room of Illinois Masonic Hospital when Ms McShane and Ms Jurich were first admitted. Trauma surgeon Dr Marius Katilius said Ms McShane suffered a traumatic brain injury, with blood discovered both inside and outside the skull. Three separate lacerations were discovered. There was blood in her hair, and on her scalp and face. There was "a lot of blood", Dr Katelius said. But he also revealed that following a scan "an opaque structure in the back of the throat" was identified. The medical team "pulled out a stone from the back of the throat". The friends were attacked under a viaduct as they walked home together after a night out in Chicago three and a half years ago. Ms McShane, from Silverbridge in County Armagh, was a 23-year-old student attending the University of Illinois at the time of the assault. She had been on an exchange programme, studying urban planning. Her family watched intently as items of her clothing found at the crime scene were pulled from a brown paper evidence bag at the trial. Images of the scene, with Ms McShane's cream-coloured jacket entwined in an olive green sweater beside pools of blood, were also shown in court. A police evidence technician was giving testimony on what she found at the scene. Later, images of Mr Viramontes at a petrol station were shown. Prosecutors allege he tried to use Stacy Jurich's credit card at the station less than half an hour after the two young women were attacked. The trial earlier heard evidence from Ms Jurich, who also suffered serious injuries in the attack. In testimony, Ms Jurich described the moment she was hit. "I heard my head being hit and I felt an excruciating pain and sort of lost my equilibrium," she told the court. "Stupid bitch," her attacker whispered as he snatched her purse and ran off. Ms Jurich said she never saw a face as all her attention was directed towards her friend. "She was not moving on the ground. The blood started coming out of her head," she said. Mr Viramontes, 34, is charged with two counts of attempted murder and 23 other charges linked to his alleged involvement in the attack on 23 April 2010. Apart from Ms Jurich, the trial has also heard testimony from Sheila McShane, Natasha McShane's mother. She described how her daughter remains severely disabled, unable to walk without support, incapable of conversation and barely able to communicate. The jury saw video footage of Ms McShane as she was helped to walk and of her struggling to pick up and drink from a cup of tea. The state's key witness, Marcy Cruz, has pleaded guilty to attempted murder for her role in the attack. The trial of Mr Viramontes is expected to last up to two weeks. </body>

      <title>Trust admits child deaths liability</title>
      <description>Belfast Health Trust accepts liability for the deaths of two children in its care during a public inquiry into hospital deaths in Northern Ireland.</description>

      <body>A health trust has admitted liability for the deaths of two children in its care during a public inquiry into hospital deaths in Northern Ireland. Claire Roberts and Adam Strain died months apart while they were being treated at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children in 1995 and 1996. Their deaths are being investigated by the inquiry into hyponatraemia-related deaths in Banbridge, County Down. The issue of hospital fluids management is central to the public inquiry. Hyponatraemia is the term for a low level of sodium in the bloodstream, which causes the brain cells to swell with too much water. Four-year-old Adam Strain died shortly after undergoing a kidney transplant at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children in 1995. Claire Roberts was nine when she died at the same hospital the following year. She had been admitted following vomiting and drowsiness and doctors prescribed intravenous fluids. However, Claire was given a fatal overdose of fluids and drugs. In the 17 years since her death, Belfast Health Trust had denied that fluid management played any role and wrongly attributed Claire's death to a brain virus. The trust maintained its stance during the child's inquest in 2006. However, at the public inquiry on Thursday, the trust's lawyer said his client now accepted it was liable for Claire Roberts' death and made "a full and frank admission of liability on behalf of the Belfast Trust". He said it also wanted to offer "a sincere apology for the shortcomings in the management of Claire's treatment" and acknowledged that it had failed to treat the child to an appropriate standard. During the hearing, the Belfast Health Trust also admitted publicly for the first time liability in the earlier case of Adam Strain. It had previously settled this case with Adam's family but a confidentiality clause prevented any detail of that settlement from emerging. The public inquiry is also investigating specific issues around the treatment of 15-year-old Conor Mitchell who was admitted to Craigavon Area Hospital on 8 May 2003. The following day, the teenager was transferred the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children, where he died on 12 May. At Thursday's hearing, the Southern Health Trust admitted that guidelines had not been followed when the teenager was treated in Craigavon Area Hospital and it apologised to his family. However, the Southern Health Trust has not accepted liability for Conor's death. The inquiry chairman, Justice John O'Hara QC, welcomed the admissions and acknowledged that it was "never easy to admit when mistakes had been made". Mr O'Hara said the families had made it clear that their pursuit of the truth was "in memory of their children" and that he hoped that today "they feel there is some added justification for what they have done". Speaking to BBC Northern Ireland after the hearing, Claire Roberts' parents welcomed the trust's apology and admission of liability as a small step forward but said there were still many questions over their child's death that had not been answered. The inquiry into hyponatraemia-related deaths is investigating fluid management issues after the deaths of five children in Northern Ireland hospitals. It is looking into the deaths of three of the children, the events following the death of another and a number of issues arising from the death of a fifth. The deaths all took place between 1995 and 2003, and in each case, the way in which fluids were given to the children following surgery is implicated in their deaths. On August 30, the Western Health and Social Care Trust admitted liability over the death of nine-year-old Raychel Ferguson. Raychel died in June 2001, a day after an appendix operation at Altnagelvin Hospital, Londonderry. She was administered a lethal dose of intravenous fluid after her appendix was removed. </body>

      <body>A driver who killed two motorists during an "outrageous" high-speed road race and then fled to the pub has been jailed for five years. Luke Jones, 24, was doing up to 100mph on the A465 Heads of the Valleys road near Brynmawr moments before the crash. Cardiff Crown Court heard Jones, of Clydach, near Abergavenny, braked sharply while racing Phillip Bath, 29. Mr Bath lost control of his car which hit oncoming traffic and he and a motorcyclist died in the "carnage" . Father-of-one Jones fled the scene and went drinking with a friend and was later arrested at a nearby pub. Prosecutor Nicholas Gareth Jones said Jones and Mr Bath came across each other when joining the road. He added: "Their vehicles are described as racing, overtaking one another, speeding and causing other cars to dodge and swerve out of the way. "One witness described Mr Bath's car as skidding around like Formula 1 car warming up its tyres. "Another said it was an accident waiting to happen and that they were driving like lunatics. "They were driving at excessive speed - up to 90 or 100 miles an hour - for a three-mile stretch before the accident. "The collision happened when Jones misjudged the speed of a car in front and was forced to brake. "Mr Bath couldn't stop, he slammed the brakes and spun into oncoming traffic colliding with a motorcycle." Mr Bath, of Cwm, near Ebbw Vale, was taken to University of Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, by air ambulance but never recovered from his injuries. His yellow Peugeot had failed an MOT shortly before the crash and was described as being "not road worthy". Motorcyclist Glyndwr Evans, 49, of Glynneath, who used to work for the RAF, died instantly in the crash on 27 October, 2012. Another motorcyclist was treated at hospital for two and a half months following the crash and will never be well enough to ride a bike again. Jones originally told police the collision had "nothing to do with him" but later admitted two counts of causing death by dangerous driving. He said he was racing but claimed he was only doing 70 mph. Caroline Rees, defending, said: "He had difficulty doing the right thing and pleading guilty. Jones had previously been disqualified twice from driving for not having insurance. Judge Daniel Williams told him: "This was an outrageous piece of driving over quite a distance. "You were racing each other and your driving was described as frightening. "You were using the road like a race track at a time when there were a lot of cars on the road and you represented a serious danger. "At the time you were the lead car and because of your speed you failed to brake in time and Mr Bath went out of control. "I accept you are sorry but that would be of far greater weight if you had not left the scene of carnage which you caused." </body>

      <body>The body responsible for amateur boxing in Wales is "not fit for purpose" and "does not qualify for public funding", an independent audit report says. The Welsh Amateur Boxing Association (WABA) says the audit found no evidence of fraudulent activity, But its chairman said it would take all the steps recommended to put things right. Sports Wales said it would continue funding the association, but it had put special measures in place. The report into the activities of the Welsh Amateur Boxing Association (WABA) was commissioned by the association, alongside the Welsh government and Sports Wales which oversees and promotes sport and advises the government. The audit was carried out by accountancy firm, KTS Owens Thomas. In their report, which has been published in a redacted form on WABA's website, the auditors said: "It is our view that in its current state WABA is not fit for purpose and does not qualify to receive public money. "Sport Wales must consider the implications of this finding. "We consider that with the implementation of the recommendations set out in this report, WABA will become fit for purpose and qualify to receive public money." In 2012, WABA received grant support from Sports Wales of just over £190,000 - more than double its £89,000 grant in 2006. The audit report lists a series of financial concerns: The report also raises issues over the way the association has been run since becoming a limited company in 2003. It noted: "Some members have expressed concern that WABA is not open to constructive challenge and there appears to be divisions in the membership. "Overall, we have found corporate governance to be poor and dysfunctional. We consider that it is improving, but has not reached an acceptable level." The auditors make 38 recommendations for the sporting body's future, including measures to tighten financial controls, banking systems, and expenses management. Their report also calls on the board to "improve the culture at WABA", and to work with Sports Wales to ensure it follows an action plan to implement the recommendations. 'Simply not acceptable' Responding to the report, WABA chairman Terry Smith told BBC Wales: "Obviously we are very disappointed, but we will take all the steps recommended to put things right as quickly as possible." He said much of the organisation was run by unpaid volunteers who did not have formal financial training. But he disputed some of the report's findings, including the issue of unsupported spending. Sports Wales said WABA's failures were "simply not acceptable". Chief executive, Sarah Powell, said an action plan was now in place to resolve the issues at WABA. She added: "In the best interests of the sport's grass-roots participants and elite competitors, Sport Wales has decided to continue funding WABA, but has put in place special measures to protect public funds, until such time as satisfactory progress has been made on the recommendations." </body>

      <body>Five children have been killed by an old mortar shell as they dug for scrap metal in South Sudan's capital, Juba. The five were looking for metal in an old army barracks, a military spokesman told the BBC. The BBC's James Copnall says unexploded ordnance and mines remain a big problem in South Sudan, following decades of civil war. There are clear-up operations under way in several areas of South Sudan, but such explosions kill people every year. The children, aged 10-14, were killed in a former barracks in Juba's Souk Sita district, army spokesman Col Philip Aguer said. He said that a Ugandan man who was with them, presumably to buy the scrap metal, was wounded. South Sudan gained independence in 2011 after a long conflict with the north but it remains one of the world's least developed countries. In addition to the explosives left over from the war, rebels have been accused of laying new mines, particularly in Unity state near the border with Sudan, our correspondent reports. This has at times made travel around the area dangerous, he adds. </body>

      <body>An appeal court in Tunisia has acquitted rapper Ahmed Ben Ahmed, known as Klay BBJ, on charges of insulting the authorities in his songs. The rapper was jailed in September for six months for insulting the police at a concert in the resort of Hammamet. "The court has decided to reject the accusations," the AFP news agency quotes the judge as saying. During the performance in August, he sang alongside fellow rapper Weld El 15, who has been on the run since then. They had both initially been sentenced in absentia in August to 21 months in prison. Klay BBJ lost an appeal in September and was immediately jailed. But on his second appeal hearing in Grombalia, south of the capital, Tunis, the judge said his sentenced had been annulled and he was released. Weld El 15, whose real name is Ala Yaacoub, has been in trouble before for his song The Police Are Dogs. He was given a two-year sentence in June, which was later suspended but he went into hiding following his latest conviction in August. Since the 2011 revolution, which toppled long-time President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, there have been tensions between secular Tunisians and Islamists. "Our songs criticise the current situation in Tunisia and the government, no more and no less," AFP news agency quoted Klay BBJ as saying in September. A coalition led by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party has been in government since elections in 2011. </body>

      <body>A woman who was gang-raped in the Indian city of Mumbai in August has fainted in court while giving evidence. The photojournalist, who was attacked while on assignment in a deserted mill, was taken to a local hospital. Earlier the victim, aged 22, identified four of the men accused of raping her. Women's safety has been the focus of attention in India since a brutal gang rape and murder in Delhi last year, after which the Indian government strengthened its sexual violence laws. The photojournalist, who cannot be identified, had been giving evidence for more than four hours when she collapsed, said public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam. The victim was very composed, but was "under mental pressure", Mr Nikam told the BBC. He said she had identified all four men who stood trial in court on Thursday. A fifth suspect is being tried separately by a juvenile court. The photographer also identified pornographic video clips that she said she was shown while she was raped, said the special public prosecutor. Proceedings were stopped when the rape survivor collapsed, Mr Nikam said. Last month, four men were convicted and sentenced to death over the gang-rape and murder of a young woman in Delhi in December. The case led to widespread protests across India and highlighted the extent of attacks on women in the country. A bill containing harsher punishments for rapists, including the death penalty, was approved by India's parliament earlier this year. But many working in the legal system say not enough is done to protect those who bring rape cases to court. </body>

      <body>A plane carrying 49 passengers and crew that crashed in southern Laos hit bad weather as it came into land, officials in the South East Asian nation said. The Lao Airlines plane, flying from the capital Vientiane, crashed into the Mekong river on Wednesday near its destination of Pakse. All 44 passengers and five crew are believed to have died. Footage of the scene on Thursday showed divers in the Mekong river, pulling out parts of the wreckage. The passengers and crew came from a total of 10 nations, the airline said. Seventeen Laos nationals were on board, plus travellers from France, Australia, Thailand, Vietnam, Canada, China, Malaysia, Taiwan and the US. "Upon preparing to land at Pakse Airport the aircraft ran into extreme bad weather conditions and was reportedly crashed into the Mekong river,'' the Laos Ministry of Public Works and Transport said in a statement. State-run Laos news agency quoted an eyewitness as saying that the plane "appeared to be hit by a strong wind, causing its head to ascend and pushing it away from the airport area". A senior aviation official from Laos was quoted in other reports as saying the tail end of Typhoon Nari may have been a factor in the crash. An Agence-France Presse (AFP) reporter on the scene told of debris floating in the river and suitcases buried in mud on the river banks. "The search teams in Laos are taking the bodies to a local hospital," Thai foreign ministry spokesman Sek Wannamethee told AFP. An official in Pakse was quoted as saying at least six bodies had been retrieved. The plane was an ATR 72-600 twin turboprop engine aircraft. Its manufacturer, ATR, said in a statement that the plane was "delivered from the production line in March 2013". The company said it would co-operate fully with the investigation. Australian's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said that six Australians, including four members of one family, were aboard the plane. An Australian aid worker and his father were also among those believed to have been killed. DFAT released a photo of the two Australians - father and son Gordon and Michael Creighton. The family said in a statement that they had "lost a father, a husband, a son, a brother, a fiance and a best mate in one tragic circumstance". Relatives of the Rhodes family also released a photo of Gavin, a tax consultant, his wife, Phoumalaysy and their two young children. A DFAT spokesperson said that consular officials were in contact with the families of the victims and were travelling to Pakse. However, a DFAT statement said: "Lao authorities have told our embassy in Vientiane they do not expect any survivors.'' The route between the capital Vientiane and Pakse is popular with the growing numbers of tourists visiting Laos, correspondents say. Lao Airlines is small company, with just 14 aircraft in its fleet. It flies several domestic routes and has flights to other countries in the region like China, Thailand and Singapore. </body>

      <description>Eleven Nobel laureates urge Russian President Vladimir Putin to drop piracy charges against 30 Greenpeace activists and journalists.</description>

      <body>Eleven Nobel prize-winners have written to Vladimir Putin asking the Russian president to drop charges against 30 Greenpeace activists and journalists. The 30, who come from 18 nations, were held last month during a protest against oil drilling in the Arctic. The signatories - including Archbishop Desmond Tutu - described the charges of piracy as "excessive". But Mr Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, responded that the president had no power to influence the courts. The Greenpeace activists, who complain of being detained in harsh conditions, face up to 15 years in prison if convicted. So far all bail applications in the case have been refused. The Netherlands has launched legal action to try to free the activists and the ship, and more than 1.4m people have joined a Greenpeace campaign demanding their release. In the letter, which was released by Greenpeace, the laureates urge Mr Putin "to do all you can to ensure that the excessive charges of piracy against the 28 Greenpeace activists, freelance photographer and freelance videographer are dropped, and that any charges brought are consistent with international and Russian law. "We were heartened by your statement, on September 25th, that you did not believe the Greenpeace crew members were pirates," the letter goes on to say. "As you know, the Greenpeace activists were unarmed and used only peaceful means to demonstrate their opposition to the oil drilling operations threatening the Arctic. "Arctic oil drilling is a dangerous, high-risk enterprise. An oil spill under these icy waters would have a catastrophic impact on one of the most pristine, unique and beautiful landscapes on earth," the letter continues. It is also signed by former East Timor President Jose Ramos Horta, Northern Irish peace campaigner Betty Williams, and Iranian human rights activist Shirin Ebadi. But Putin spokesman Mr Peskov said the laureates had addressed their appeal to the wrong person, reported Russian news agency RIA Novosti. "The president treats Nobel prize winners and their opinions with great respect and attention. But in this case, the president is a wrong addressee," the agency quoted him as saying. He said President Putin could not file or drop charges. "Investigative bodies deal with it, and everyone should wait for the end of the investigation process and the court's verdict. "A law is a law," he added. </body>

      <title>Grand coalition beckons in Germany</title>

      <body>A grand coalition between Germany's centre-right and centre-left parties has moved a step nearer, nearly a month after the general election. The leaders of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) have agreed on formal negotiations. They reached agreement at a third round of exploratory talks in Berlin. CDU leaders seem to have softened their opposition to a national minimum wage, a concession to the SPD. Some of the negotiating will be over who gets which ministry, the BBC's Steve Evans reports from the German capital. If the SPD take charge of finance, the departure of current minister Wolfgang Schaeuble may mean a softening of German economic policy. Forming a new German government can be a long and difficult process but all the signs now point to a grand coalition, our correspondent says. The CDU, along with its Bavarian sister party the CSU, fell just short of an outright majority at the polls on 22 September. The CDU/CSU took about 41.5% of the vote, the SPD won 26%, the former communist Left Party 8.6% and the Greens 8.4%. Germany is the EU's most populous country and has its biggest economy, making it a pivotal member of the eurozone. "At the end of the third round of exploratory talks we are convinced that we can find sensible solutions for both sides, and most of all for the country, even on disputed questions," SPD chairman Sigmar Gabriel said. "The conservatives know... that a nationwide minimum wage of 8.5 euros [£7.2; $11.5]... is one of the central tasks and without this a coalition would not make sense for the SPD. That was no big surprise for the CDU/CSU." CDU secretary general Hermann Groehe said: "We have a joint goal of seeing a sensible minimum wage ruling - I am sure we will find a result but we didn't discuss it today." "In the three exploratory sessions it became clear that with regards to identifying the most pressing political tasks facing Germany over the next four years and how to deal with these, we can find enough common ground to rule this country successfully," he said. The chairman of the CSU, Horst Seehofer, said the paramount issue for him remained "no tax increases and no new debt", according to the Munich daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung. Mrs Merkel's previous coalition ally, the Free Democrats, failed to win any seats so the two-term chancellor set about seeking a new partner. Talks with the Greens ended in failure on Wednesday and both of the big parties have ruled out a coalition with the Left Party. As well as the proposed minimum wage, taxation will also be a key issue for the talks. The SPD has not won an election since 2002 and it joined a previous grand coalition under Mrs Merkel in 2005. One final hurdle for the coalition deal will be a vote by SPD party members, promised by the party leadership, on whether to endorse it. </body>

      <body>Venezuelan rescue teams have retrieved the remains of Italian fashion heir Vittorio Missoni and four other people who died in a plane crash in January. The small plane carrying six passengers plunged into the Caribbean shortly after taking off from the Los Roques islands. It was located in June some 70m (230ft) under the water, north of the Venezuelan archipelago. An investigation is underway to establish the causes of the accident. The bodies retrieved were those of Mr Missoni and his wife, Maurizia Castiglioni; two Italian friends who were holidaying with them in Los Roques, Guido Foresti and Elda Scalvenzi; and Venezuelan co-pilot Juan Carlos Ferrer. They were flown to a morgue in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas. Mr Missoni was the son of Ottavio Missoni, founder of the Italian Missoni fashion house, and co-owned the firm with his siblings. Relatives are due to arrive in Venezuela tonight. Rescue teams have been trying to recover the remains of the sixth victim: Venezuelan pilot German Marchant. Following the twin engine aircraft's disappearance on 4 January, investigators from the Italian Agency for Air Safety (ANSV) said the company that owned the small plane was not fully licensed to operate. A piece of luggage from the aircraft was found off the Dutch island of Curacao, about 320km (200 miles) west of Los Roques, later that month. Los Roques, an archipelago made up of dozens of islands some 95 miles (150km) off Venezuela's coast, is one of the area's most popular holiday destinations. </body>

      <body>A 25-year-old Mexican with the autistic condition Asperger's has won the right to make key decisions about his life without parental consent. The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Ricardo Adair by four votes to one. Mr Adair said that Mexican legislation violated the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It banned him from doing simple tasks by himself, such as applying for a passport, because of his condition. A judge will be appointed to agree which decisions Mr Adair will be allowed to make without the consent of a parent or guardian. The groundbreaking ruling is expected to have wider implications for the rights of people with autism in Latin America, says the BBC's Will Grant. "I want to be allowed to decide what to do, where to go, where and with whom I want to live or travel, where to work or study," Mr Adair told the Mexican Supreme Court. Mexican legislation makes straightforward tasks, such as buying a mobile phone, enrolling in university or applying for a driving licence, very difficult for people with Asperger's syndrome or other forms of autism. Mr Adair said all papers had to be signed by his parents or legal guardians. He began his battle two years ago and has been supported in his fight by a non-profit organisation. "All we wanted was for Ricardo's own free will to come first, and now the court has recognised that," his lawyer, Andres Gomez Montt, told the BBC. Mr Adair said he wanted to read the full court ruling before making further comments, but expressed his satisfaction at the decision. "They have asserted our rights and I believe this is a great step forward," he said. Mexican legislation on people with disabilities was drafted with the intention of protecting them, by taking away legal responsibility for their actions, but Mr Adair's mother says the law is out of date. "Many children have different levels of disability. Some need more support, some need less. This should be about giving to each one what they need," Leticia Robles told BBC Mundo earlier this year. The UN's World Health Organization describes autism spectrum disorders as "a group of complex brain development disorders". It affects one in each 160 children around the world on average, the WHO says. "These disorders [which include Asperger's syndrome] are characterized by difficulties in social interaction and communication and a restricted and repetitive repertoire of interests and activities." </body>

      <title>Inspectors hail progress in Syria</title>
      <description>Chemical weapons inspectors say they are making good progress in Syria, having completed nearly 50% of their work.</description>

      <body>Chemical weapons inspectors in Syria say they have completed nearly half of their work in the country. A spokesman for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical weapons (OPCW) said the team was making good progress in its mission to inspect more than than 20 sites. However he said security remained a concern for the 60 inspectors - who have been in Syria since 1 October. "A few" sites remained inaccessible to the team for security reasons, he said. The OPCW's mission to rid Syria of chemical weapons was set up by a UN resolution. It followed international outrage at a chemical weapons attack near the Syrian capital Damascus in August. The organisation's work in Syria marks the first time the international chemical weapons watchdog - which won this year's Nobel Peace Prize - has been asked to oversee the destruction of a weapons armoury during a conflict. The OPCW, which is based in The Hague, said the team in Syria had completed nearly 50% of their work of inspecting sites and destroying equipment. Under the UN resolution, Syria's chemical weapons production equipment must be destroyed by 1 November and stockpiles must be disposed of by mid-2014. The deadline for Syria to submit its "destruction plan" was 15 November, the OPCW said on Thursday. OPCW spokesman Michael Luhan told the BBC that there had been a number of security incidents over the last few days which had given the inspectors "cause for concern". On Wednesday night there had been a mortar attack near the hotel the inspectors are staying in Damascus and over the weekend a number of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were detonated in cars nearby, he said. Meanwhile, Syrian state TV reports that a Canadian United Nations worker, missing since February, has been released in Damascus. Carl Campeau had been working as a legal adviser to the UN Disengagement Observer Force that patrols the ceasefire line between Syria and Israel in the Golan Heights. The Syrian government says the Canadian was kidnapped by rebels but has now been handed over to a UN representative. An international conference on a political solution to Syria's conflict could take place in Geneva on 23-24 November, Qadri Jamil, Syria's deputy prime minister, said on Thursday. He made the announcement after talks at the foreign ministry in Russia, Syria's main international ally. More than 100,000 people have been killed in the fighting that has ravaged Syria for two-and-a-half years, according to the UN. More than two million people have fled Syria and some 4.5 million have been forced from their homes within the country. Casualty figures vary for the chemical weapons attack on the Ghouta agricultural belt around Syria's capital, Damascus, on 21 August. It was estimated to have killed hundreds of people. The United States and other Western powers blamed the attack on President Bashar al-Assad's forces. But Mr Assad accuses Syrian rebels of being behind it. </body>

The man broke down the gate to the base, between Ramallah and Jerusalem. Military doctors treated the man for his injuries but he died a short time later. There were no Israeli injuries. Palestinian sources told AFP that the dead man was named Yusef Ahmed al-Radaydeh. There have been a number of recent deadly attacks by Palestinians on Israelis in the West Bank, as well as the shooting of a nine-year-old girl a fortnight ago.

      <body>Newark Mayor Cory Booker has won a special election to represent New Jersey in the US Senate. Mr Booker, 44, defeated Republican Steve Lonegan in a race to replace Senator Frank Lautenberg, a Democrat who died in June. With almost all of the vote counted, Mr Booker led Mr Lonegan by 55% to 44%. The Democratic mayor of New Jersey's largest city will become the second black senator in the current Congress and the first from New Jersey. On Thursday, Mr Booker acknowledged the Senate's low approval ratings in the wake of the highly partisan government shutdown and debt ceiling debate. But, he told MSNBC television's Morning Joe he was a "scrapper" who looked forward to tackling tough issues. "I'm hoping to join with a lot of good people from both sides of the aisle," he said. Considered a conservative activist, Steve Lonegan, 57, is a former mayor in Bogota, New Jersey, and the former New Jersey state director of Americans for Prosperity - a group funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, which advocates a limited role for government. Mr Booker has been mayor of Newark since 2006, when he came to power promising to turn round a city suffering from high unemployment, public corruption and rampant crime. Widely billed as a rising star in the Democratic Party, Mr Booker is a progressive on social issues, supporting same-sex marriage, healthcare reform and gun control. Both candidates sought to boost their campaigns with the backing of celebrities. While Mr Lonegan received the support of the former Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Cory Booker won the endorsement of US talk show host Oprah Winfrey. Mr Booker will serve the remaining 15 months of the late Mr Lautenberg's term and will have to run for re-election in November 2014. When he arrives in the Senate, replacing Republican appointee Jeff Chiesa, the Democrats will increase their control of the upper chamber to 55-45. </body>

      <body>The Guardian journalist who broke the Snowden leaks story is to join a new media project being set up by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. Glenn Greenwald confirmed he was leaving the UK newspaper for the mass media outlet being planned by the French-born billionaire. Laura Poitras, the documentary-maker who connected Greenwald with Edward Snowden, is also expected to join. Mr Snowden leaked details of US government surveillance programmes. The former US intelligence contractor is now living in Russia, where he was granted temporary asylum after fleeing Hong Kong in June, shortly after the revelations were published. On Wednesday, British Prime Minister David Cameron accused The Guardian of having knowingly compromised national security by publishing the leaks. Greenwald, a US citizen based in Brazil, insists that none of the information he published could have damaged national security. Announcing his new project in a statement, Mr Omidyar said he wanted to support "independent journalists in a way that leverages their work to the greatest extent possible, all in support of the public interest". His project, he said, was in its early stages but he had approached Greenwald and found that he and fellow Americans Poitras and Jeremy Scahill, an investigative journalist, were already contemplating something similar. "We had a lot of overlap in terms of our ideas, and decided to join forces," said Mr Omidyar. The billionaire said his new outlet would be independent of other media with the focus on allowing independent journalists to "pursue the truth in their fields". "And, I want to find ways to convert mainstream readers into engaged citizens," he said in the statement. Mr Omidyar's existing projects include the US-based Omidyar Network, a philanthropic investment firm which operates in some of Africa's most troubled countries. Forbes magazine estimated the Frenchman's net worth to be $8.5bn (£5.3bn; 6.3bn euros) last month. Announcing his departure in a statement on Tuesday, Greenwald said he was embarking on a "once-in-a-career dream journalistic opportunity". </body>

      <description>The effect on bereaved people of a random knife murders</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-22966016</url>
      <date>1382000214</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70511000/jpg/_70511384_holly-91.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>National crime figures have shown that murders involving a knife have dropped 9% in the past year, from 207 in 2011-12 to 189 in 2012-13. The figures provide a dispassionate, statistical snapshot of these crimes, but do not yield the experiences of those left behind - the families. Here are some of their stories. The narrative of fatal knife crime is usually a simple one. A person is killed, the grieving family releases a tribute, the case goes to court and the person responsible is imprisoned. The police will then release a statement on behalf of the family in which the detectives are thanked for their help in securing justice. Some people might even use the word "closure". And that, appeals not withstanding, is that. Only it never is like that. The real impact of violent deaths on surviving families is rarely told. It does not fit the prescribed narrative with its neat beginnings, middles and endings. Mood swings, addiction, the loss of toenails and hair, suicide attempts, marital collapse, alienation from friends and difficulties with eating - the physical and social effects of bereavement are less reported. The after-effects of knife crime on the bereaved can resemble the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) experienced by post-combat soldiers, psychologists say. This is something Anne Oakes-Odger knows all too well. Her son Westley Odger, 27, was stabbed in the neck outside a cash machine in Colchester in 2005. He died of his injuries. The "reason" for the attack was that he told someone not to jump the queue. Ms Oakes-Odger, who lives in Essex, believes the psychological and physical impact of murder on surviving family members is poorly understood. "You feel as though you are losing your mind," she says. "When a child is murdered, it is out of the normal course of events. "The shock element creates a lot of physical and mental issues for every member of the family. "One of the things which happened to me was my hair fell out in bunches and my toenails fell off. I thought that was peculiar to me, but I found out it wasn't." The loss of her hair and nails was, she says, a symptom of the stress of living in a sustained "flight or fight" state. She also suffered colour blindness. "During the early years I was not seeing things in colour. I could only see in black and white and various shades of grey. "There isn't a 'closure' with homicide." The criminal justice system itself hinders rather than helps, according to Ms Oakes-Odger. For months or years after a murder, the loved one is more "evidence" than person, and can be subjected to multiple post mortem examinations. And at the centre of proceedings sits not the victim, or their family, but the accused. Grieving while the wheels of justice roll, she says, is nigh on impossible. And by the time they do stop, the psychological damage is already done. The Ministry of Justice says it understands the "immeasurable suffering" experienced by victims' families and that it is committed to making sure more support than "ever before" is available to them. This includes the national Homicide Service, which offers such families a Victim Support caseworker and access to specialist counselling. The department is also "revamping" the Victim's Code which it says will make "major improvements for victims" and give them a clearer guide about their entitlements and sources of help. These are the type of measures Tanya (pictured above), who asked for her surname to be withheld, says she desperately needed. Her husband Gary, 59, was murdered by their son Ed who, after killing his father upstairs with a hammer and a knife, came downstairs and tried to kill her. She heard two "thuds" upstairs and believes had she not turned around to see her son before he attacked she too would have died. The killing happened a week before Christmas in 2007. The family had enjoyed a normal day and Ed had been upstairs in his room. He asked Gary to come up and help him fix his stereo. It was then that he killed him. Her son, who was 15 at the time, is serving 18 years for murder and attempted murder. He had denied the charges, claiming his state of mind was altered by the anti-depressant fluoxetine. "I lost everything that day," she says. Like Ms Oakes-Odger, Tanya's toenails fell out. Even now, six years on, she still loses her nails when she is under stress. After her husband's murder, the former nursery worker could not bring herself to use knives - even cutlery knives - or face opening her post. Looking back, Tanya says there is precious little support offered to the families of people violently killed. The attention and support, she says, goes to the perpetrators. The victims' families, Tanya says, are - with the exception of police family liaison officers - left to find their own way through the emotional and practical debris of a disaster. "There was nothing," she says. "And it takes so much for you to ask for help. And you just don't have the words. It would be much better if support was offered to you, even if you didn't take it there and then, but could take it along the way. "My two other children (who were in their late teens when their father was murdered by their brother) had no support." Also difficult has been the expectations wider society places on the families. "It has been five years but I still have days when it is hard - anniversaries. Some people are really good and know when you're not in the right place. Others say 'you're OK' and they expect you to be OK and so for those people, you are. "I still have times when I have to put the knives away and when people are doing DIY with hammers... but it is part of everyday life, and you have to get used to it." For some, deaths can trigger a personal redefinition. A shy person learns to speak out, for example. Take Holly Watson. Now aged 20, she met her half-brother Lewis when she was 14. Just two years after they met, Lewis was dead. The 23-year-old was stabbed three times in Sudbury, Suffolk. The only photograph she has of Lewis, who was a keen angler, is of him holding a fish. She never got to say goodbye as he was dead before she got to hospital. "That was hard," she says. "I had never seen a dead body before. And when the first body you see is your big brother, well that's hard to deal with. "I became a bit of a recluse. At the beginning I hated the world and everybody in it. "It was almost like a hysteria, with Lewis dying, the funeral and the waiting, like limbo land, and then the court case and then everybody said it would get easier with the closure, but it doesn't." Immediately after her brother's death, she was unable to pick up a cutlery knife. "To begin with knives made me feel sick, I couldn't use them. We felt we could not hold something that had killed Lewis." Then there was the impact on her ambitions. Holly had always wanted to be a lawyer. But as she started to explore the law, she found many of the scenarios put to students in law exams involved knife crimes. Her ambitions for the law were put on hold. Next year she will turn 21. It is not an anniversary she is looking forward to. Her brother, she says, should be there for it. And should she ever marry, then Lewis should have been there for that too. But he won't be. "I dread the day when I have children and I have to tell them that their uncle isn't here," she says. "The biggest thing in getting over something like this is in accepting that the world is not always what you want it to be." Holly says she used to be shy. She is now an anti-knife violence campaigner. So too is Caroline Shearer. Her 17-year-old son Jay Whiston was fatally stabbed in the heart outside a house party in Essex last September. Exactly what happened remains unclear and is currently subject to court proceedings. Ms Shearer describes the days since her son's death as a "living torture" peppered only by the briefest of moments each morning, in the gap between sleep and consciousness, when the anguish of loss is kept at bay. She would love to have all of the happy memories she shared with Jay at the forefront of her mind. Instead, the recurring image which haunts her is of her boy on the cusp of adulthood lying dead on a mortuary slab. "I was a mother of two children then, within three hours, I was a mother of one," she says. "He was a normal, everyday, loving, caring boy. I always say he had such a huge heart, they couldn't have missed." The grief she describes is like a sledgehammer. There are gaps in the day when she might, for example, notice the weather, or have a conversation. And then the grief hits her, again and again. It is with her throughout the day - as she washes clothes, cooks meals or sees a car of the same colour as Jay's - and last thing at night as she falls asleep. And she too had difficulties with eating. She tells how shortly after Jay's death she struggled to use kitchen knives or cutlery - because of their association with the implement used to kill her son. None of the symptoms reported by the families surprise clinical psychologist Don Macleod. Mr Macleod has worked with families across the north west of England who have suffered tragedy. Some suffer PTSD symptoms more often associated with combat veterans. But for the families, he says, the expert knowledge needed to help them is often not there. "I would be almost certain that your average GP would not actually tag what's going on with someone having that kind of reaction," says Mr Macleod. "The GP might know there had been a murder in the family, but they might not have the time or indeed the skills and knowledge to be able to pinpoint that [PTSD] is what the issue is." Part of the issue is that the initial responses to grief - anger, anxiety, flashbacks and depression - are, although extremely unpleasant for the people suffering them, "completely normal" given the circumstances. They become an issue, he said, when they "become protracted" - such as with PTSD. Can these families ever recover? Ms Oakes-Odger thinks they can, but it is a slow, painful process which results not in a return to how things used to be but in acceptance of the way they are now. "It is about finding a new 'normal'," she says, "a normal in which you can lead a purposeful life, one you can go forward with." </body>

      <title>Digging deep on social mobility</title>
      <description>How young will 'pay the price' for lack of social mobility</description>

      <body>Alan Milburn says he was asked by the coalition to "hold its feet to the fire" in examining its progress on social mobility and child poverty. But just how much will his words hurt? In this, the first of what is planned to be an annual "State of the Nation report", the commission led by the former Labour health secretary concludes that "Britain remains a deeply divided country", one where "being born poor often leads to a lifetime of poverty". The commission says austerity has made it even harder to break ingrained cycles of poverty, that "disadvantage and advantage cascade down the generations". It warns there is a danger that social mobility will go in to reverse after rising in the middle of the last century and "flatlining" towards the end of it. The post-war years saw a big expansion of the middle classes, as the professional jobs market grew and more people bought their own homes, but there has been little change in the last quarter of the century. Mr Milburn said over decades, the UK had become a wealthier society, but had "struggled to become a fairer one" and had more children living in poverty and lower levels of social mobility than "many other developed nations". A total of 2.3 million children (one in six) live in poverty, he said, and this made it essential that the pattern where "birth not worth" determined a person's chances in life was changed. Higher social mobility had become "the new holy grail of public policy". It is certainly something all parties now say they want to see. The report from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission has stinging words on some areas of government policy but they are sweetened with praise for others, including the fact that the coalition continues to "stick to its commitments" on ending child poverty and improving social mobility in "challenging times". Mr Milburn told journalists at a news conference the government "deserved credit" for that. But the target of ending child poverty by 2020 - begun under Labour and continued by the coalition government - would "in all likelihood" be missed, he said. His most stinging criticism seemed to be about the way the young were likely to pay the highest price for a lack of social mobility and poverty during the global financial crisis. He called for older generations to be asked to dig deeper. The number of young people who have been unemployed for two years or more is at a "20-year high", he said. And there was an "inter-generational unfairness" in terms of who was being asked to pick up the bill in the recession. He did not call for pension cuts, but Mr Milburn said politicians should be prepared to "break political taboos" to talk about whether wealthier pensioners should lose benefits currently available to all - particularly the winter fuel allowance and the free TV licence. Pensioners were usually more worried about their grandchildren than themselves, he said. The commission is also looking to employers to do more - to offer better training, pay higher wages and open up professions to a wider pool of people. Two-thirds of children living in poverty, the report says, are living in homes with a working parent. Schools and universities were also urged to do more. He said schools in some areas were letting down pupils from poorer homes and those from middle-income homes too. Schools should give more help to low-achievers from middle-income homes as well as the poorest, while the government should improve careers advice, give extra incentives for teachers to teach in the worst schools and pay colleges "by results they achieve for their students in the labour market - not the numbers they recruit". As for universities - which were the focus of an earlier report by the commission - he says the sector as a whole has drawn in more students from poorer homes but top institutions remain out of reach for too many. Each year, he said, there were 3,700 "missing" state school pupils who had achieved the grades needed to get in to universities in the Russell Group (which represents some of the UK's leading universities) but did not go to them. The commission called for the government to put social mobility at the heart of its policies and practices, so that it was a "golden thread" running through all it did. It concentrated on the overall UK picture, but pointed out that in Scotland and Wales, the issue "currently has a low profile". In an age of austerity, the report's authors suggest creating a fairer society will be a job for all - and far from pain-free. </body>

      <title>Could new guidelines have stopped Savile?</title>
      <description>Five reasons the TV presenter wouldn't escape the net today</description>

      <body>Prosecutors have published detailed guidance on how to handle sex abuse allegations in the same week as Surrey police released transcripts of an interview with Jimmy Savile. The new guidance comes down to a simple shift in thinking that can make a profound difference: trust, rather than doubt, what the victim is saying. But would it have made a difference in the Savile scandal? Between 2007 and 2009 Surrey Police investigated allegations of sexual abuse by Savile at the Duncroft Approved School in Surrey. Police eventually interviewed him at his office at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in which they put the allegations to him. His first reaction was to deny anything and to blame the victims. The evidence against Savile had come to the police slowly and, despite the misgivings of prosecutors, the detectives had pursued early leads and found other possible victims or witnesses. There was nothing to suggest the three victims who made allegations against Savile had colluded or were unreliable. The CPS's own review of this decision concluded that "police and prosecutors treated claims with a degree of caution which was neither justified nor required". The new guidance stresses that prosecutors should focus on the credibility of the allegation, rather than perceived weaknesses in the victim. Savile wasn't nationally famous in the 1950s - so why would he have faced some kind of conspiracy all those years ago? Was this flippant exaggeration or a signal that he had created a script and backstory to cover up decades of offences? The new guidance urges police and prosecutors to look for and assess intelligence of suspicious behaviour down the years, such as signs that an offender selects and abuses each victim for a short period before moving on to someone else in another location. This is a classic tactic of shifting the focus of suspicion onto the victim. Duncroft educated troubled girls - and Savile's message was that troubled girls can't be trusted. Many sex abuse cases have failed because of a reluctance by police and prosecutors to put victims from troubled backgrounds before a jury. The new guidance warns police and prosecutors not to fall into the trap of believing myths about some victims. It says don't dismiss a complaint just because a victim has a troubled background. Secondly, it tells police and prosecutors to ensure that the victim has been given appropriate outside help, such as therapy or other support. The charity Victim Support says that this kind of support is critical in helping the victim to cope from the earliest stage with preparing to give evidence at trial. The recent Old Bailey trial of men who ran a massive street grooming and sex trafficking ring in Oxford demonstrated beyond doubt that juries will believe these kinds of victims if the prosecution case is properly prepared and presented - and the victims have been supported to tell their stories. That's a straight denial to a straight question - his word against theirs. But other evidence can be found. Offenders who abuse are likely to also have images of abuse on a home computer or elsewhere. The new guidance says detectives should go looking for those kinds of abuse images as soon as possible. The oddest section of the interview is when Savile starts bragging about his influence and power in law and the police. But his tactics aside, the guidance says that forces need to share information properly with themselves and other agencies - and here is a specific hint that there are other forces know about allegations made against him. In the case of Savile, the modern expectations would be for the forces who each knew a piece of the picture to have properly shared that information with others. Crucially, if that intelligence leads to victims - then they ultimately should be told about each other because it could help them to find the courage to give evidence. So could these new rules have uncovered and stopped Jimmy Savile's offending? The answer is yes, because the CPS has already conceded that he could have been charged, had prosecutors and the police "taken a different approach". It may still have been very difficult to get a case into court - but down the years the opportunities were there. </body>

      <title>Is it a good idea to allow China a stake in UK nuclear?</title>
      <description>Is the UK getting too close to China with latest power deal?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24563535</url>

      <body>The UK is to allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. Is this a good idea? It is 57 years to the day since the Queen threw a lever to start electricity flowing from the world's first civil nuclear power plant, at Calder Hall, in Cumbria. If you had told any of the dignitaries present that day that Britain would one day surrender control of its nuclear industry to foreign powers, losing in the process the ability to build its own reactors, they would have thought you were mad. But we have long got used to the idea that Britain is no longer an industrial powerhouse. So why should we be concerned that China, a former Cold War enemy, has been given the go-ahead to invest in new nuclear plants? The economics are simple enough. Britain needs new nuclear power plants to keep the lights on. But it has ruled out public subsidies, so badly needs private investment. "We need to see investment not just from China but from Japan, the US, France and the City of London," said Energy Secretary Ed Davey, an architect of the deal between French energy giant EDF and China General Nuclear Power Group. The deal is initially confined to a 30% stake in a single new plant, at Hinckley Point, which will be built using French and Japanese technology. But it could lead to Chinese companies taking majority stakes in future projects, and will see Chinese technicians being trained by British nuclear scientists. It is being hailed by Chancellor George Osborne as a triumph of British diplomacy, potentially opening up China's rapidly expanding nuclear energy market to British companies and keeping energy bills down for British consumers. But not everyone is quite so ecstatic. "With continuing concerns about Chinese cyber-attacks on foreign governments' computer systems, should we really be inviting companies which many believe to be effectively arms of the Chinese government into our critical infrastructure at all?," writes Stuart Nathan, in trade magazine The Engineer, calling the deal "inexplicable". In a recent Financial Times blog, former Downing Street energy policy adviser Nick Butler summed up the concerns: "They will be inside the system, with access to the intricate architecture of the UK's National Grid and the processes through which electricity supply is controlled, as well as to the UK's nuclear technology." Lord West, cyber security minister in the previous Labour government, has been vocal about the threat posed by China to Britain's computer networks - something always denied by the Chinese government. "China has an army of people hacking into our systems. They are engaged in industrial espionage on a massive scale," Lord West told BBC News. He is particularly concerned about the deal between BT and Huawei, which gives the Chinese telecoms giant access to Britain's telecommunications network, as highlighted earlier this year in a highly critical report by the intelligence and security committee. But the former Home Office minister says he is relatively relaxed about a Chinese company taking a stake in Britain's nuclear industry, beyond the "embarrassment" of living in a country that is no longer capable of building its own reactors. "We probably don't have to worry too much, as long as we have a separate and free state with a Parliament that retains control," he says. It is not as if China is a rogue state or about to go to war with Britain, although, he adds, things could change. "In 50 years time you never know what will happen. If someone knows your critical infrastructure very well they can do damage to it." There are also concerns about China's human rights record, which does not seem to have been mentioned by Chancellor George Osborne in his meeting with Chinese officials, despite a new Foreign Office 'action plan' urging firms to pay more attention to the issue. "It could set a dangerous precedent," says an Amnesty International spokesman, "If other countries see Britain doing business with China without mentioning human rights then they will follow suit." The key question for many, however, is why can't Britain, the country that pioneered civil nuclear energy, build its own reactors? The UK is uniquely relaxed among Western nations about foreign ownership of key national assets like nuclear power plants, says Antony Froggatt, lead author of the annual World Nuclear Industry Status Report. In the US, Australia and Canada foreign companies are prevented by law from owning critical infrastructure. EDF was recently blocked from building a third reactor at the Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant, in Maryland, due to America's ban on foreign ownership. In some European nations, state-backed "national champions", such as EDF, dominate the nuclear market, while in others, such as Germany, the industry is being wound down. British companies will be involved in building new nuclear plants, says Mr Froggatt, and there is nothing to stop the government breathing new life into Britain's own nuclear industry, which once led the world. But nuclear is a "very risky" investment without massive public subsidies, due to the long lifespan of the plants, and even mighty state-backed enterprises now like to spread the risk by seeking partners. It is also an increasingly niche business. At the nuclear industry's peak in 1979, there were 234 plants under construction around the world. Now there are just 66 - 28 of which are in China. "If you were to build up a new industry you would be better doing it in other fields," says Mr Froggatt. But he adds: "I hope that the government, by encouraging this Chinese investment isn't promising that Chinese reactors will be built in the UK because it hasn't got the power to do that." The current design of Chinese reactors would be unlikely to meet British safety standards. But experts say the real prize for the Chinese is to gain approval from the UK nuclear industry regulator, known as one of the toughest in the world, for a new generation of designs, which could open the door to Western markets. Mr Froggatt is also concerned that the political consensus in the UK, with all three main parties now firmly behind nuclear energy, has prevented tough questions being asked about the wisdom of the current policy. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, quizzed about the China deal on his weekly LBC radio show, summed up the government's laissez fare approach. "If people want to come here and build safe sustainable low-carbon ways of generating energy without dollops of British taxpayers' subsidy in a way which is entirely regulated by us, where the rules are set up by us, not in Beijing, then of course that's something we should be open to. "Because we've got to keep the lights on and we've got to protect the environment." </body>

      <title>Why did it go wrong at Al-Madinah?</title>
      <description>What does the Al-Madinah case say about free schools?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24569961</url>
      <date>1382028225</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70548000/jpg/_70548135_madinah.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Described as "dysfunctional" and "in chaos", there can be no doubt that the problems at the Al-Madinah School go right to its core. Rated inadequate in all four inspection areas, Ofsted said problems at the Derby school were "myriad". Not only does it lack the basic structures needed to operate, it is said to be close to "collapsing". Al-Madinah is the second free school to be put into special measures, after Discovery Free School in May 2013. A further five out of the 24 inspected so far have been labelled "requiring improvement" - the next worse category. But then it is only two years into the programme. Across England the latest Ofsted figures show that 2% of state schools are in special measures - 383 out of 21,186 inspections. But no up-and-running free school has unravelled quite so publicly as this Derby-based Muslim faith school. It started with claims about female staff being required to wear hijabs, Islamic headscarves, but the focus has shifted to the "unacceptable" level of education the government and inspectors now say it is providing. The key thing that makes this Ofsted report stand out, is the fact that the findings come just a year after the school opened. Most schools that deteriorate tend to do so over a much longer period of time. And many of the problems it highlights seem to have implications for the particular nature of free schools and the extra freedoms they are allowed. The report's second line says: "This is a school which has been set up and run by representatives of the community with limited knowledge and experience." Education Secretary Michal Gove argued that taking schools out of the hands of bureaucrats would liberate innovators to push up standards through reform and experimentation. But the Ofsted findings in this case reflect exactly what detractors of such DIY school projects feared would happen. They asked how people who knew little about education could set up and run something so complex and important as a school. In addition, teaching, which the government sees as the most important engine raising attainment, was found to be "inadequate". "Many teachers are inexperienced and have not received the training and support they need," the Ofsted report said. This seems to highlight one of the most fundamental differences between free schools and regular state schools - there is no obligation to employ qualified teachers in England's free schools. The Department for Education argued that it gave free schools this freedom, which exists amongst independent schools, to enable them to employ industry experts. But this does not appear to have worked in the pupils' favour in the Al-Madinah case. The Ofsted report said: "Almost all teaching seen during the inspection, including in the Early Years Foundation Stage, was judged inadequate." It added that most teaching and lessons in the primary school were poorly planned and that teachers did not know how to use pupils' assessments to plan lessons and set work. Questions are now being asked about how the Department for Education could approve a school for opening one year, only for it to be found to lack the "basic systems" it needs to operate 12 months later. Were the checks necessary for ensuring the school would be fit for purpose undertaken in a sufficiently rigorous way? Judging from the pre-registration report undertaken by Ofsted in the July before it opened, no assessment was made by the inspectorate of the school's ability to educate pupils. But Ofsted did wave the red flag at this stage over child protection measures, saying that four regulations had not yet been met and that staff needed to undertake training on such issues. This was highlighted by shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt in an emergency question in the Commons. The DfE has insisted that it took all necessary steps to ensure the school was fit for purpose when it opened in September 2012. It said: "Ofsted recommended Al-Madinah should be registered as long as four requirements were met. "Ofsted often sets out a number of requirements it wants to see before new schools can open. In this case, [Al-Madinah Education Trust] provided the necessary evidence to show that these requirements were met." But the report also said the school had "not been adequately monitored or supported". Prime Minister David Cameron has taken to local radio to say that the school should close if it does not take immediate action to put things right. But he also said that this particular case should not be used as a "stick to beat the whole free school movement" as these were delivering a better standard of education than most state schools. He quoted figures hailed by the DfE earlier in the year which said three-quarters of the first free schools were rated good or outstanding - which a spokesman pointed out was a significantly higher proportion than all state schools. But Mr Hunt said the education of children in Derby was being sacrificed for ideology. He added: "It's not just the Al-Madinah School which is dysfunctional, it's the education secretary's free school policy." </body>

      <title>At university with Cory Booker</title>
      <description>'How new US Senator gave me my greatest sporting moment'</description>

      <body>The US has a new senator, Cory Booker, who swept to an election win in New Jersey on Wednesday. The Democrat is tipped for great things by his supporters, which comes as no surprise to those that knew him at university. In Marshall Curry's Oscar-nominated film about Cory Booker's unsuccessful 2002 campaign to be mayor of Newark, New Jersey, he shakes hands with a girl while out canvassing. She turns to the documentary-maker's camera and says: "Smell my hands 'cos I just touched Cory Booker." "He smells like the future." Now Cory Booker has earned a Senate seat after beating Republican Steve Lonegan this week, it's worth recalling how much star quality he had when he was at The Queen's College, Oxford, in the early 1990s. He was a Rhodes scholar with a masters degree from Stanford. I was five years younger and just starting out on my first degree. Booker was such a striking figure that you always noticed him. I've never met anyone with as much charisma as Cory - he could make you feel better about yourself with a nod from the other side of the quad. You know when you see charisma in someone - the atmosphere changes when they enter the room and you want to get to know them. I had signed up for the university's inter-college American football tournament. It was flag football, so instead of jumping on opponents to tackle them you have to pull a velcro flag off their belts. Booker had been a player of national standard in high school and then played for Stanford University, so was just the man to teach us the game. But he had a job on his hands, because we were dreadful. It turns out that a good American football team needs to have at least one player who can throw and one who can catch. We had Booker, who could do both, but that's not enough. We lost all of our games, but the preparation was extraordinary. He showed us a particular play, which he said Stanford had used to "whip Notre Dame's ass". The rivalry between the Fighting Irish and the Stanford Cardinals makes the annual game between them a grudge match. So it made for a surreal experience playing in the middle of a park in Oxford, using tactics that had been devised for a game played in front of 90,000 people. Before our first game, Cory gave us a team talk. Team talks are the bread and butter of great sporting films, but I'd never been on the receiving end of a proper motivational talk before. We all sat around him as he told us a story, about a time when he was playing college football and another player was questioning whether he wanted to win enough. I think it may even have been a player he admired from another team. In the denouement of the story, this enormous player sat on Cory's chest (and he's not a small chap himself), stopping him breathing. We were gripped by this narrative, as Cory, without raising his voice, gradually got to the point in the story where he was about to pass out and the other player told him that he would not be a great player until he wanted to win as much as he wanted to take a breath. It was extraordinary - I wanted to win that game more than I've wanted to do anything. In a pretty hopeless team, I was easily the worst player. But in a game that we lost, like all the others, I had my moment. I was playing on defence when the person I was supposed to be marking got many yards away from me and prepared to catch what would have been a touchdown pass. I ran and took a huge, goalkeeper-style dive and got my fingertips to the ball. I remember watching it dribbling over the sideline as I landed in a heap on the floor. Cory dragged me up from the ground with his hand over my eyes, so I could hear the shouting around me but not see the team. He generously described it as the greatest play he'd seen. I've played a lot of pub football and village green cricket since then and had some pretty exciting moments, but I would have no hesitation in describing that as the greatest sporting moment of my life. It's not because there was much at stake - I think we were already way behind in the game. It was exciting because of the atmosphere and motivation around the team that Cory had created. As mayor of Newark, Booker has been credited by his supporters for overseeing a drop in violent crime and reducing the city's budget deficit. But he also has a national profile thanks to his prolific and savvy media appearances. His clever use of social media was most notably demonstrated when he was tweeted by a woman whose elderly father needed help shovelling snow from his drive. After a brief exchange, Booker himself turned up at his home to offer a helping hand. On another occasion, he assisted one of his Twitter followers to propose to his girlfriend. An all-action reputation was sealed when he rescued a woman from a burning building and then a year later rescued a dog in frozen conditions. He also took in people temporarily homeless from Hurricane Sandy. But there have been bumps in the road. Eyebrows were raised when the 15-year-old son of CNN chief Jeff Zucker became an advisor at a tech start-up Booker co-founded with the help of some high-profile investors in Silicon Valley. Booker sold his stake in the firm last month. No such criticism at Oxford, where Cory had a great effect on Rabbi Shmuel Boteach, who was the representative in Oxford of the chasidic Jewish movement, Chabad-Lubavitch. He'd set up a rival Jewish Society for Oxford students called the L'Chaim Society. In practice, it was seen by students as a club for American post-graduates, which had very impressive speakers. But it was still quite a shock when Rabbi Boteach appointed Cory, a 6'3" black Baptist, to be president of the society. The rabbi said he'd given Cory the job because he was the best person he knew. Cory would give talks at the society's Friday night dinners about that week's Torah portion and apparently has been studying biblical tracts with Rabbi Boteach ever since. When Cory was running to be mayor of Newark, his opponents criticised him for not really wanting that job, saying that it was just a stepping stone to higher political dreams. It says a lot about him that in the Senate campaign, his opponents have been saying the same thing. Talking to other contemporaries from Queen's he seems to have been widely liked and admired. He volunteered for the charity Nightline, which gives emotional support to students, as well as doing some voluntary work in a school on the nearby Blackbird Leys estate. We were all wrong about him at college though. We were convinced he'd be the first black president, and he missed that boat. But I wouldn't bet against him in a future race. </body>

      <title>The problem with taking too many vitamins</title>
      <description>Can taking supplements actually harm your health?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24563590</url>

      <body>Millions of people swear by vitamin supplements. But many are wasting their time and some could even be harming themselves, argues Dr Chris van Tulleken. In November 1912 a party of three men and 16 dogs set out from a remote base in eastern Antarctica to explore a series of crevasses many hundreds of miles away. Three months later just one of the men returned. His name was Douglas Mawson. His skin was peeling off and his hair was falling out. He had lost almost half his body weight. He recounted what Sir Edmund Hillary described as "the greatest story of lone survival in the history of polar exploration". A month into their journey, one of the team, along with the tent, most of the provisions and six dogs plunged into a crevasse, never to be seen again. Mawson and the other surviving member, Xavier Mertz, started to return to base, surviving in part by eating the remaining dogs. After a few weeks Mertz developed stomach pains and diarrhoea. Then his skin started to peel off and his hair fell out. He died incontinent and delirious a few days later. Mawson suffered similar symptoms. With the kind of understatement typical of his generation of polar explorers he described the skin of the soles of his feet peeling off: "The sight of my feet gave me quite a shock, for the thickened skin of the soles had separated in each case as a complete layer... The new skin underneath was very much abraded and raw." It was the suffering of early explorers and sailors that motivated the first studies of vitamins and their deficiency diseases. At first sight Mawson's story seems to be another such tale - starvation combined with a lack of some vital nutrient. In fact, Mawson's description of his symptoms is an almost textbook description of vitamin A overdose - probably from eating dog liver. As little as 100g of husky liver could give a hungry explorer a fatal dose. Mawson lived to the decent age of 76 but in his story we find the cautionary tale for our times - vitamins can be very bad for you. This piece is about what we have learned about vitamin supplements in the last few years - if you are healthy, and you live in a country like the UK, taking multi-vitamins and high-dose antioxidants may shorten your life. For most of us, for most of the time, they're unhealthy. "Argh!" I hear you say, "I spend loads of money on them and the claims on the packet are really persuasive. Everything, from my full head of hair to my sex life, depends on them!" I want to get into this in a bit more detail because the vitamin companies certainly don't agree with me. So why do we believe they're useful and why do we take them? Vitamins are essential for life, and there are groups of people even in the UK who benefit from specific supplementation, but general unsupervised vitamin pill-popping is more than just a waste of money. The problem is that we all feel very warm and fuzzy about vitamins because, firstly, the tales of deficiency are so horrific, secondly, we read breakfast cereal packs and thirdly, a double-Nobel laureate called Linus Pauling liked vitamin C in vast, vast doses. All this is packaged by the people now selling us vitamins over the counter into that most beguiling of all logical falsehoods - if a little is good, then more must be better. Now I knew the names of the most obscure vitamins long before medical school because I have always had a fondness for the kind of multicoloured, artificially flavoured breakfast cereals that are marketed using a combination of unlikely cartoon animals and claims of being "vitamin and mineral-enriched". And it has to be said that this vitamin and mineral enrichment of staple food has been one of the most effective public health interventions in history. It continues to save countless lives per year even in Europe. So, while you shouldn't eat dog liver in Antarctica, vitamin A deficiency hugely increases the risk of blindness and death in children with measles and diarrhoea in developing countries. So the World Health Organization recommends a very strict amount and cautions that higher doses can cause birth defects in early pregnancy among other problems. So vitamins do make a huge difference to life expectancy in some circumstances, which is persuasive, and the breakfast propaganda catches us in our most vulnerable, bleary-eyed, early morning state, hinting to us that these vitamins have some sort of catch-all, beneficial effect on our lives, that will transform us into the healthy, energetic beautiful people/cartoon creatures portrayed on the cereal box. These things contribute to a general ideal of healthfulness of vitamins. And then there's Linus Pauling. Whether or not you've heard of him, Linus Pauling is a major influence on vitamin and nutrient culture. It's almost impossible to imagine someone with more authority and credibility. He won two Nobel prizes and was, by all accounts, a genuinely good bloke. He wrote a book in 1970 saying that high doses of vitamin C could be effective in combating flu, cancer, cardiovascular disease, infections and degenerative problems. He took immense quantities himself, hundreds of times the required amount, and lived to a ripe old age surrounded by many great grandchildren. He was the poster boy for mega-dosing of vitamins and this contributed to the growth of an industry supported by the belief that supplementation of these molecules in our diet is beneficial in almost every way imaginable. But rather than taking one man's word for it, however credible, it's worth looking at the results of studies that look at what happens to people who take these supplements for long periods of time. Looking at any one individual study won't be very revealing to answer the question of whether vitamin supplementation is good for you. They're densely scientific and the conflicts of interest can be very hard to spot. For the answer you have to turn to what are called "systematic review papers". This is where independent scientists gather up all the available data and re-analyse it to answer big questions. Here's what a couple of them say: "We found no evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention [of diseases of any kind]. Beta-carotene and vitamin E seem to increase mortality, and so may higher doses of vitamin A. Antioxidant supplements need to be considered as medicinal products and should undergo sufficient evaluation before marketing". (See references below). Just to be clear - "increase mortality" - that means they're killing you. These are powerfully bioactive compounds but they're not regulated in the same way as drugs. Whatever you think about the regulation there should surely be a warning on the pack if there's data saying they're bad for us. The next question is - why are they bad for us? It's very hard to pick apart the data, partly because vitamins are a fabulously diverse group of chemicals. I'm going to include what people normally refer to as minerals under the heading of vitamins. They're required in the diet not for energy, but as chemical partners for the enzymes involved in the body's metabolism - cell production, tissue repair, and other vital processes. Their functions are understood largely by their deficiency diseases so we're not exactly sure of precisely what they all do or how they interact. Antioxidants provide a nice example. They soak up the very toxic, chemically-reactive by-products of metabolism called free radicals. These free radicals, left unchecked, can cause damage to DNA and may be linked to cancer. Your cells are full of antioxidants but surely taking more would be better? Right? Keep those cancer causing radicals under control? Well, unfortunately, your body's immune system fights infections by using free radicals to kill bugs. Exactly what effect huge quantities of extra antioxidants could have on this is not clear but it's easy to imagine that it might not be good and you could get more infections. Vitamin A is linked to increasing lung cancer in smokers. Excess zinc is linked to reduced immune function. Long-term excessive intake of manganese is linked to muscle and nerve disorders in older people. Niacin in excess has been linked to cell damage. And so on. And it gets more complicated still when you start mixing everything up in one tablet. For example, different minerals compete for absorption. If you take large quantities of calcium you won't be able to absorb your iron. If you take large quantities of iron you won't be able to absorb zinc. If you take vitamin C you'll reduce your copper level. So it's not just that taking lots of one thing is not good for you, it's that it may cause a dangerous reduction in something else even if you are also supplementing that. To work out the optimal ratios is all but impossible although some manufactures claim to have worked it out. So when are supplements recommended? The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends certain supplements for some groups of people who are at risk of deficiency, including: Your GP may also recommend supplements if you need them for a medical condition. If you decide to take supplements, stick to within the RDA, unless you've had guidance from a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist to exceed the dose. If you've got questions about dosage levels, consult a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist. The tales of deficiency combined with the success of enrichment programs means that it's easy to make that leap of logic that if a little is good then more must be better. And if you read my article last week on water you'll see where this is going. I could do this every week. The same article. Substitute water for vitamins/probiotics/antibiotics. Don't trust the science done by the people who are trying to sell them to you and don't assume that if some is good more must be better. It's like beer. Or coffee. Or computer games. Goldilocks was right about things needing to be just right. References: Bjelakovic G, Nikolova D, Simonetti RG, Gluud C.

      <body>Where once politicians lined up to bash the bankers, now they line up to belt the "big six" - the nation's energy firms. Where once they promised to stop bonuses, now they pledge to curb gas and electricity bills. The question they know voters are asking is: can you really make a difference and if so how? The ministers' answer, for now, is greater transparency and competition. They're calling on companies to spell out precisely what is forcing them to hike their prices. Why - they ask - is British Gas blaming them for the rising costs of green schemes and subsidies for the poor when other companies can meet the same obligations for much less money? They're examining why it takes so long for people to change suppliers. Where once they criticised proposals to intervene in the market they now boast of moves to put some customers on the lowest available tariff. Not good enough, says Labour. They point out that only one in 10 customers benefited from that promise and say that the big six must be forced to re-structure and to have their prices frozen while they do. In truth politicians of all colours are having to grapple with not one energy crisis but three: rising bills, climate change and the very real threat of blackouts. It's easy to say that you'll cut bills at the same time as putting pressure on them to rise to pay for greener energy and greater investment in new power stations to stop the lights going out. If you're the politician who can convince voters you can actually do it you're on to a winner. </body>

      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby is criticised by Ofsted inspectors as "dysfunctional" and rated inadequate in every category.</description>

      <body>A Muslim free school has been damned by Ofsted inspectors as "dysfunctional" and rated inadequate in every category - within a year of it opening. An inspection at Derby's Al-Madinah school was brought forward after fears were raised over teaching standards. The report says teachers there are inexperienced and have not been provided with proper training and that the school requires special measures. The school said it accepted the report and would use it to move forward. Reacting to the findings, David Cameron told BBC Radio Derby: "If they don't take immediate action to deal with these things then I think it is right it should close and I think it's absolutely right to intervene rapidly when these things aren't working properly." However, he added: "Let's not use this as a stick with which to beat the whole free school movement - there are now hundreds of schools which have set up as free schools, and on average they have more outstanding and good ratings than established schools. "When it goes wrong - just as with a state school - you've got to get in there and sort it out, or close it down," he said. The Ofsted inspection had been due to take place by the end of the year but was prioritised following initial allegations that female teachers were obliged to wear hijabs and boys and girls were segregated. The school has since written to pupils and staff telling them there is no requirement to cover their hair. Education minister Lord Nash last week warned the school it faced closure unless discrimination against female staff and pupils stopped. A spokesperson said: "We were already investigating this school before allegations became public. We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection. "We have received a response from the Al-Madinah Education Trust as well as a report on the school from Ofsted. Any decisions made will take into account all the available evidence." The Ofsted report found that pupils were given the same work "regardless of their different abilities" and the governing body was "ineffective". It said basic systems were not in place, describing the school as being "in chaos" and "dysfunctional". Boys and girls had different lunch sittings but the report said this was due to the small size of the canteen. Inspectors gave the school the lowest ranking - "inadequate" - in every area, prompting the chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw to call for it to be placed in special measures. This means Ofsted will carry out inspections at the school at short notice to monitor improvements. If poor performance continues the school could be closed. Dr Stuart Wilson, the acting head teacher, said there were "significant and serous problems" at the school and accepted some of the lessons were not meeting necessary standards. "Are special measures a disaster for the school? Yes, they are," said Dr Wilson. "It's not where we want the school to be at this time but we accept the report." In one mathematics lesson, described by Ofsted as "insufficiently challenging", pupils spent the majority of their time cutting out and pasting shapes. Dr Wilson said the school, which has 412 pupils aged between four and 16, had a lot of issues to deal with but he insisted it did have a future. "Obviously the report doesn't make pleasant reading for anybody - we don't want to be in this position - we wish we weren't in this position - but what we need to do now is to accept the report in full and use it to move the school forward." Writing to the school's chair of governors on Thursday, Lord Nash said the Ofsted report was "further compelling evidence of the breaches of the funding agreement I have required you to address". "Contrary to your suggestion that I have acted prematurely, I am even more convinced of the need for very decisive and urgent action on the part of the trust to comply with all your obligations and remedy the serious failings at the school." One parent told the BBC: "I know they are teaching my children well. I'm seeing their progress and I have no concerns at all about the school." Another, Razwana Akbar, said: "I am very angry. They have broken the trust as professional teachers, they have let us down." Chris Williamson, MP for Derby North, said: "Frankly, the position of Al-Madinah school is now untenable and I would fully expect the school to close and for the children to be found alternative places in the council schools in the city." Speaking in Parliament earlier, shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said the Ofsted report was a "devastating blow to the education secretary's flagship policy". He said: "It reveals that pupils have been failed on every possible measure and parents will want to know why the education secretary has allowed this to happen." He described the government's free school programme as a "dangerous free-for-all". "David Cameron and Michael Gove can no longer ignore this issue - it is a crisis entirely of their own making," he said. But speaking at the weekend, Mr Hunt told BBC One's Andrew Marr programme that although Labour would not open new free schools "along the Michael Gove model", the bulk of existing free schools would be kept open as his party wanted to "keep the good free schools". Responding to Mr Hunt's more recent comments, the schools minister David Laws said that the government had taken "swift action" to deal with failings at the Al-Madinah free school told MPs that no school would be allowed to "languish in failure". He also accused Labour of "total and utter opportunism" using the report "to shift its position". </body>

      <title>Teachers' strike closes schools</title>
      <description>Thousands of schools close across much of England as teachers strike over pay, pensions and jobs.</description>

      <body>Thousands of schools were closed across much of England as teachers went out on strike over pay, pensions and jobs. Teachers in London, Cumbria, the South East, North East and South West have been taking part with nearly 3,500 schools shut or partially closed. The action was part of a continuing campaign of regional strikes involving members of the NUT and NASUWT unions. Prime Minister David Cameron said the strike was "inconvenient for parents" and "not good for pupils' education". NUT general secretary Christine Blower, said the union regretted the disruption caused to pupils and parents but teachers felt they had "no other choice". Major rallies have been taking place in Bristol, Durham and London, with smaller events in other areas, including Brighton, Carlisle and Plymouth. Teachers are objecting to proposals by Education Secretary Michael Gove to bring in performance-related pay, increase their workloads and make changes to their pensions. Twenty out of 33 London boroughs provided information to BBC London 94.9 about the number of schools affected. Of those, about 445 schools were completely closed and 450 partially closed. And in Tyne and Wear, at least 471 schools were affected by the industrial action. Head teacher Roberta Kirby, from Fernhurst Junior School, in Portsmouth, said the government had "declared war" on teachers. More than 200 schools in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight were affected by the action. She said: "If we cannot offer good wages and a pension that staff pay into that reflects the work they do, then we are not going to be able to attract the best graduates." Responding to the impact of the strike, some parents said they had found it difficult to find alternative childcare. The BBC's Sarah Ransome said: "People in Plymouth have been telling me that finding alternative childcare because of the strike has been 'quite a headache'." A similar walkout by teachers took place in the east of England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber region on 1 October. Ms Blower said: "Mr Gove has done nothing to address the crisis of low morale in the teaching profession which threatens the continued provision of high quality education." Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said the "overwhelming majority of teachers" were on strike. She said: "Teachers are committed and dedicated public service workers. They do not take strike action lightly. "No teacher has any wish to inconvenience parents or disrupt pupils' education, but this action is not the failure or due to the unreasonableness, of teachers." Plans for a national one-day walkout before Christmas have also been announced by the two unions. Speaking to BBC Sussex, Mr Cameron said responsibility for the strike "lies with the teaching unions". "I think it is very disappointing they have decided to go on strike," he said. "And when we look at the things they are striking over, pensions and pay, they are things that have been decided independently by well-led reviews. "I was at my children's school today in London. One class was not there but the rest of the school was operating. "So, every praise to those teachers who have gone ahead and kept our schools open for our kids." A spokeswoman for the Department for Education (DfE) said 27% of the schools in the affected regions were closed. However, there was no figure available for how many were partially closed. She said: "The NUT and NASUWT have tried to create as much disruption for pupils and parents today as possible. "In spite of this, thanks to many hardworking teachers and heads, only around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed today." </body>

      <title>Bright poor 'held back for decades'</title>
      <description>The qualifications of adults now in their 40s, 50s and 60s were as much influenced by social background as intelligence, a long-term study finds.</description>

      <body>The level of qualifications achieved by adults now in their 40s, 50s and 60s was influenced by social background as much as their own intelligence, according to a long-term study from the University of Oxford. It found that children of the same ability went on to achieve very different levels of exam results. Academics tracked 5,000 people in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It comes as a report on social mobility is about be published. The study, from Oxford University's Department of Social Policy and Intervention, examined the academic achievements of cohorts of people born between the late 1940s and 1970. Their academic results as young adults were compared with cognitive ability tests taken when they were aged between 10 and 13. It showed that children from wealthier and better educated families had been much more successful in exam results than poorer children of a similar intelligence level. It meant that many poor, bright young people leaving school in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s failed to reach their full potential. Among the youngest of this survey, leaving school in the mid-1980s, fewer than one in five went to university. Among the oldest group, who would have left school in the early 1970s, only about one in 20 reached degree level. Last week figures from the OECD think tank indicated the 55-65 age group in England had stronger literacy and numeracy skills than 16-24-year-olds, even though the younger group had much better qualifications. The OECD has warned about the diminishing job prospects for those without skills. And this study shows the long roots of the academic gap between rich and poor and the lack of social mobility in education. What surprised the Oxford University researchers was that a parallel study in Sweden, across the same decades, also showed a strong link between economic background and academic achievement. The lead author of the study, Erzsebet Bukodi, said there were expectations that Sweden would have had more equal outcomes, but the results showed that poorer children were also disadvantaged there. Co-author, Prof John Goldthorpe, said the results showed that Sweden was not "significantly ahead" in terms of a meritocratic system and he said it raised questions about whether educational policies could be used to promote social mobility. Dr Bukodi also highlighted how the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s were decades of great social change, with a perception of increased social mobility, but the studies in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland and Sweden showed a sustained picture of a social gap in exam results. Across three decades there had been no diminishing of this link between social background and achievement, said Dr Bukodi. Despite the lack of a level playing field, it still remained possible for bright children from poorer backgrounds to out-perform those who were from wealthier backgrounds, but with less intelligence. But it was an uphill struggle. The study suggests that among the cleverest children born in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland in 1970, in the top fifth of the ability range, 80% of the richest children achieved two A-levels or their equivalent, compared with only 40% for the poorest. It meant that for poor children with high levels of intelligence, a majority left school in the 1980s without two A-levels. "We see that in both the British and Swedish educational systems, even the very brightest children are hampered if they come from a disadvantaged background," said Dr Bukodi. "It is possible of course that clever individuals choose other ways of getting on in the world than through education, but the fact remains that many children in British and Swedish schools do not appear to fulfil their academic potential." </body>

      <title>Apprentice schemes 'need reform'</title>
      <description>Apprenticeships in England need to be overhauled to stop many young people being offered practical qualifications that have little worth, a study says.</description>

      <body>Apprenticeships in England need to be overhauled to stop many young people being awarded practical qualifications that have little worth, a report says. Compared with other European countries, many apprenticeships are low quality and too short, the Sutton Trust warns. It says thousands of apprenticeships should be created to boost the economy and improve youngsters' job prospects. The Department for Education says apprenticeships are being reformed to "drive up standards". The Association of Colleges said some existing apprenticeships were respected by industry and should be preserved. The study, which was carried out by the Boston Consulting Group on behalf of the Sutton Trust, says fewer than 200,000 of the 520,000 apprenticeships starting in England every year are rated at level three - which is equivalent to A-level. The report cites figures that suggest apprenticeships are offered by just one in five (20%) of employers in England, compared with over half (51%) in Germany, which, the report says, is considered to have one of the best vocational education systems. Only 61,000 new apprenticeship starts were for young people, whereas in Germany, 570,000 new apprenticeships are for youngsters and 90% of these are equivalent to A-levels. The report also notes that England's vocational system has 18,000 different qualifications, while Germany has 330. The report warns that since 2010, more than half (58%) of apprenticeships have been below level three and three-quarters have been aimed at those over the age of 25, many of whom are already in work. And it warns 11 young people are competing for each apprenticeship. In his foreword to the report, Sutton Trust chairman Sir Peter Lampl said the report had found that, with some exceptions, the opportunities on offer to young people who did not go to university were "poor". The attitude in England, with some exceptions, was very different to that in countries such as Germany and Switzerland, he said. "Instead of a clear system of respected vocational routes, we suffer from a complicated patchwork where too many young people are offered qualifications of little worth in a system that confuses employers and is not valued as it should be by society," he said. He said the "cruel deception" about an expansion in apprenticeships, when many were below level three and the majority went to older workers, had to stop. The report calls for apprenticeships to be radically expanded, with up to 300,000 new starts each year. The majority of these should be at level three at least for three years, with some four-year courses at level four - higher than A-levels. No more than 10% of apprenticeships should be two-year courses at level two, it says. Sir Peter said: "Real apprenticeships are as important to social mobility as good university degrees. "Students facing huge loans for a university education find themselves between a rock and a hard place. Even if they would prefer to work with training, the lack of good apprenticeships means they feel they have little choice. "England's patchwork vocational system not only hinders our economic competitiveness, it prevents tens of thousands of young people from gaining good skilled jobs." Teresa Frith, from the Association of Colleges, said: "Creating 300,000 apprenticeships, when the report acknowledges there is already a shortage of apprenticeship places for 16 to-year-olds, would be a massive challenge and although we agree that there is a business case for employers to take on apprentices, at the moment too few do. "The report also says level three apprenticeships should be the priority. This isn't a bad idea in principle but some level two apprenticeships, such as those in construction, are well-respected by the industry and should be preserved. "The report is absolutely right to say that vocational courses should only be taught in institutions with high-quality facilities and expert teaching staff and that careers advice and guidance needs to be improved." A Department for Education spokeswoman said: "We are already radically reforming apprenticeships to drive up standards so that they are more rigorous and responsive to the needs of employers. "Since 2010 over a million people have become apprentices, providing a great start to their careers. We have already insisted that apprenticeships last for a minimum of a year, include more English and maths and that every apprenticeship is a job. "We have consulted on wider reforms to drive up standards in apprenticeships further, and will publish plans later this month." </body>

      <description>Working parents in Britain no longer earn enough to "escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn warns in his first report.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24553611</url>

      <body>Working parents in Britain "simply do not earn enough to escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn has warned. Two-thirds of poor children are now from families where an adult works, his report found. Many low and middle-income children face being "worse off" than their parents because of falling earnings and rising prices, Mr Milburn added. Wealthier pensioners' benefits should be cut and minimum pay raised, he said. The former Labour health secretary suggested some benefits currently protected from cuts - such as free TV licences and winter fuel allowances for pensioners - could be means tested in order to share the burden of austerity more fairly. But a spokesman for David Cameron said: "The prime minister believes it is right to make commitments to pensioners in relationship to state provision." The government has pledged to safeguard such benefits until the next general election. In its first report, the government's Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission warned the target of ending child poverty by 2020 would "in all likelihood be missed by a considerable margin" - leaving as many as two million children in poverty. Poverty is defined as having a household income that is less than 60% of the national median income. The latest government figures on poverty, released in June, show the median UK household income for 2011/2012 was £427 a week - 60% of that figure was £256 a week. In that year, 17% of children, or 2.3 million, were classed as being in poverty while 15% of working-age adults, or 5.6 million, were in poverty. For pensioners, meanwhile, that figures was 16% - or 1.9 million. The report said Britain still had "high levels of child poverty and low levels of social mobility" with a rising number of children in "absolute poverty" coming from working families. Two thirds of children officially deemed as being poor now came from a family where at least one parent was working - and in three out of four of those cases, at least one of their parents was working full time, the report found. It also said the "twin problems of high youth unemployment and falling living standards" were storing up problems for the future. Among its key recommendations the report urged the government to: "Just as the UK government has focused on reducing the country's financial deficit it now needs to redouble its efforts to reduce our country's fairness deficit," the report said. Single mother Judith Healy, who works from home as a telemarketer, said that, while her wages had not gone up, her expenses had continued to increase. She said she was worried about paying energy bills this winter. "We didn't ask to get in this situation, we are doing the best that we can in the circumstances that we have and that's really what it's about - it's survival now," she told BBC News. Mr Milburn told the BBC: "Today child poverty is a problem for working families rather than the workless or the work-shy." Around five million people in the country, mainly women, were earning less than the living wage, which is about £7.45 an hour outside of London, he said. "These are the people frankly who do all the right things, they go out to work, they stand on their own two feet, they look after their families - they're the strivers not the shirkers - and yet they're all too often the forgotten people of Britain and I think they desperately need a new deal." Mr Milburn said that while ministers and employers could do more, it was unrealistic to expect the government to continue topping up low pay using working tax credits. He advocated a scheme for pairing bright children with the best teachers in an effort to raise attainment. Mr Milburn has previously said social mobility - the idea that individuals can better themselves in terms of educational opportunity, job prospects and salaries from one generation to the next - is "flat-lining". Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg welcomed the report, but warned that "punishing pensioners isn't going to help a single child achieve more in life". Enver Solomon, of the National Children's Bureau charity, said the report was "a wake-up call for all political parties by stating that our country is dramatically polarised between the haves and have- nots". "As the commission states, there is an urgent need to rebalance the distribution of resources so that the burden of austerity is more equally shared," he said. Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said the "powerful report" showed "ordinary families' living standards [were being] squeezed and social divisions [were] deepening as a result of this government's decisions to put a privileged few first". On Wednesday, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed the number of unemployed people in the UK fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million in the June-August period. </body>

      <title>University staff to strike over pay</title>
      <description>University staff are to stage a one-day national strike at the end of this month in a row over pay.</description>

      <body>University staff are to stage a one-day national strike at the end of this month in a row over pay. Institutions across the UK are expected to be affected by the action, taken by three unions - the University and College Union (UCU), Unison and Unite. The Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), which represents universities as employers, said it was disappointed by the move. The news comes as teachers plan a strike in parts of England on Thursday. Members of the National Union of Teachers and the NASUWT are staging a further regional strike in their continuing row over pay, pensions and workload. The unions planning the university strike for 31 October claim a 1% pay rise offered to staff - including lecturers, technicians and administration workers - means there has been a 13% pay cut in real terms since October 2008. For Unite, the turnout for the ballot was 28% and of these, 64% (1,654 members) voted in favour of action. For the UCU the turnout was 35%, with 62% voting in favour of strike action. Unison declined to release details of what percentage of its membership had voted. It only said of those who had voted, 54.4% had been in favour of action and 45.6% against. UCU head of higher education Michael MacNeil said: "Staff have suffered year-on-year cuts in the value of their pay. Quite simply, enough is enough. "We urge the employers to reflect on the fact that they are about to face their first ever strike by three unions at the same time and come to the negotiating table to resolve this dispute. "The suppression of academic pay is one of the most sustained pay cuts since World War II and, while strike action is always a last resort, the fact that staff are prepared to take this step demonstrates just how angry they are." A spokesman for UCEA said: "Employers do understand that the general 1% uplift offered to all may be frustrating to these trade unions, with 5% of the workforce saying they will support strike action. "However, we also know that much more than this is going into pay increases for HEI [higher education institution] staff: 3% incremental rises for many plus merit payments beyond this. "Our HEIs tell us that the vast majority of their staff understand the reality of the current environment and would not want to take action that could harm their institutions and their students." </body>

      <title>Teenagers face 'sexting' pressure</title>
      <description>A surveyl suggests almost two thirds of teenagers have been asked for sexual images or videos of themselves, BBC Newsnight learns.</description>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70517000/jpg/_70517718_sexting.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Six out of 10 teenagers say they have been asked for sexual images or videos, an NSPCC/ChildLine survey seen by the BBC's Newsnight programme suggests. Of those questioned, 40% said they had created a sexual image or video, and about a quarter said they had sent one to someone else by text. The NSPCC's head, Peter Wanless, said "sexting" was getting much more common. "These results show that sexting is increasingly a feature of adolescent relationships," he told Newsnight. "It is almost becoming the norm that a young person in a relationship should share an explicit image of themselves," he said. For the survey, NSPCC and ChildLine spoke to 450 teenagers from across the country. Of those who had sent an image or video to someone else by text, 58% said the image had been sent to a boyfriend or girlfriend, but a third said they had sent it to someone they knew online but had never met. About 15% said they had sent the material to a stranger. Of those who said they had sent a photo to someone, 20% said it had then been shared with other people, while 28% said they did not know if their picture had been shared with anyone else. More than half (53%) of those questioned said they had received a sexual photo or video, a third of whom had received it from a stranger. Under British law it is legal to have sex aged 16, but it is illegal and a serious criminal offence to take, hold or share "indecent" photos of anyone aged under 18. However, the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) told Newsnight it was highly unlikely children would be prosecuted for sexting. "I've been sent a picture before, when I was at school," Daniel, 19, told Newsnight. Speaking from the Salmon Youth Centre in Bermondsey, south-east London, he said: "This girl [and me] had an argument the next day - not about the picture but about something else. "I got so angry, I was sending that picture everywhere. It was mean. I felt bad after. To this day she hates me, but that's not the point. I shouldn't have done it in the first place." Taylor Weekes, 17, told Newsnight: "Most girls of my generation do it for attention, to try and find love out of it, but it usually is the wrong way." According to figures from the National Crime Agency's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop) command, 62% of children aged 12-15 owned a mobile phone in 2012, with the figure expected to rise by the end of 2013. Experts say growing smartphone ownership, together with evolving technology, has helped created a perfect storm. Even many of the cheapest mobiles now have cameras with which teenagers can easily take pictures of themselves and distribute them cheaply. With most phones now connected to the internet, "sexts" can instantly be posted on social networking sites - quickly accessible by millions of people. Ceop is dedicated to eradicating the sexual abuse of children. It says it is concerned about images falling into the wrong hands. "What we're seeing is abusers taking advantage and getting images out of young people and then blackmailing them for more by saying, 'If you don't do more for me, I'll send these to your family and friends,'" Ceop's head of education, Jonathan Baggaley, said. Now there are growing calls for the government to do more to educate young people about the potential dangers of creating and posting self-generated sexual content. Ministers say that from 2014 all children in England from the age of five will be taught how to stay safe online as part of the new IT curriculum, while existing guidelines offer a sound framework for sex and relationship education in school. But campaigners say the dangers of sexting should be covered in personal, social, and health education (PSHE) lessons. "Sexting is not an IT issue, it's a relationships issue," deputy children's commissioner for England Sue Berkowitz said. She says every school should run a comprehensive relationships and sex education programme. "It must cover things like sexting and use of mobile technology, as well as all other aspects of relationships and sex education," she added. </body>

      <title>Fear over part-time student numbers</title>
      <description>Rising fees and pressure on household spending are behind a 40% fall in part-time student numbers, say university leaders.</description>

      <body>A "perfect storm" of causes is leading to a rapid and worrying decline in part-time student numbers in England, university leaders have warned. The Universities UK study blames rising fees, pressure on household budgets and reduced support from employers. It examines why part-time students have fallen by 40% in two years, equivalent to a reduction of 105,000. There are concerns that such part-time courses are necessary to provide the skills needed by industry. Sir Eric Thomas, who headed the review, said "something is going wrong". There has been widespread recognition of the economic importance of part-time courses in allowing adults to improve their skills. Most of the 500,000 students taking part-time courses are adults, a majority are women and most will be studying a vocational or work-related course. But the numbers have been been tumbling for two years and the report says that next year's recruitment figures do not suggest that this downward trend will be reversed. Professor Thomas, who is vice-chancellor of Bristol University, said: "The reality is that the UK needs more graduates and relies heavily on part-time higher education to meet these fast-changing skills needs in a fast-changing world. "We ignore part-time study's transformative power for individuals and society at our peril. "In England in particular, numbers are declining and do not look like rallying." The report says that the sharp decline in numbers reflects a combination of factors. It calls for part-time courses to be seen as an integral part of higher education and "not as an add-on". "There needs to be an urgent push at all levels - national, regional and local - to help potential students and employers understand the value of and opportunities for part-time higher education," says the report. Rachel Wenstone, National Union of Students vice president, said there needed to be more thought about how part-time degree courses were compatible with people's lives. "This obvious decline cannot be swept under the carpet any longer - there needs to be a collective response from all levels to the challenges that these groups of students are facing," she said. The Confederation of British Industry's chief policy director, Katja Hall, said: "It's shocking that the number of part-time undergraduate students has plummeted over the last two years. "For our economy to stay competitive we'll need more people with higher levels of skills, so it's more important than ever that working people have the opportunity to re-train and up-skill." Alex Bols, executive director of the 1994 Group of research-intensive universities, said: "A decline in part-time study could hamper the UK's attempts to extend its skills base and economic growth." </body>

      <body>Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a study from the RSPB suggests. The three-year project found that only 21% of children aged 8-12 were "connected to nature". Girls were much more likely than boys to be exposed to the great outdoors, while children in Wales had the lowest score across the UK. The RSPB says that a perception among some adults that nature is dangerous or dirty could be holding children back. There has been an increasing amount of research in recent years underlining the lack of contact and experience with nature among modern children. Some have argued that this is having a negative impact on their health, education and behaviour. In 2012, the National Trust published a report on the phenomenon of "nature deficit disorder", though it is not recognised as a medical condition. The RSPB says its new study is the first to quantify the scale of British children's exposure, or lack of it, to the natural world. They came up with a definition of what "connected to nature" actually means and then developed a questionnaire with 16 statements designed to assess the level of connection among children. Some 1,200 children from across the UK were asked to agree or disagree with these statements. Only 21% of children in the UK had a level of connection with wildlife and the natural world that the RSPB believes should be realistic and achievable for all youngsters. This "realistic and achievable" value is based on the average scores of children visiting RSPB sites or who are junior members of the organisation. One interesting finding was the gender difference. While 27% of girls were at or above the "realistic and achievable" target, only 16% of boys were at the same level. "We need to understand these differences," Sue Armstrong-Brown, head of conservation at the charity, told BBC News. "Whether boys and girls are scoring differently on different questions, are girls more empathetic to nature than boys for instance? We need to analyse the data to find that out." The report also highlighted significant regional differences. Only 13% of children in Wales achieved the basic level of exposure, compared with almost twice this number in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The average score for London was higher than the rest of England. Overall urban children had a slightly higher connection than those living in rural areas. According to Sue Armstrong-Brown, the attitudes of adults may be having a significant effect on children. "There is definitely an attitude out there, in some cases, that nature is not perceived as interesting or engaging. In some cases it is perceived as a dirty or unsafe thing, and that's an attitude that won't help a young person climb a tree." The RSPB hopes that its study will be taken up by government as one of the indicators on the state of children's wellbeing. Sue Armstrong-Brown believes that improving the natural connection for children is not only good for the youngsters, it is crucial for the future of nature conservation in this country. "If we can grow a generation of children that have a connection to nature and do feel a sense of oneness with it, we then have the force for the future that can save nature and stop us living in a world where nature is declining," she said.

      <title>Oxford raises exam reform concerns</title>
      <description>Plans to overhaul A-levels and GCSEs could "wreak havoc" to the exams system in England, Oxford University's admissions tutor says.</description>

      <body>Plans to overhaul A-levels and GCSEs could "wreak havoc" to the exams system in England, Oxford University's admissions tutor has said. Mike Nicholson said universities and schools were worried about the limited evidence available on reforming exams. He said plans to make AS-levels a stand-alone qualification would hinder attempts to increase the numbers of disadvantaged students doing degrees. Ministers said single exams would end the "test treadmill" in sixth-forms. Speaking at a Westminster Education Forum in central London, Mr Nicholson, who is director of undergraduate admissions and outreach at Oxford University, said changing A-levels was "another great example of a government's tendency to meddle in things they should probably just leave alone". He said: "There is widespread concern, not restricted to the secondary-school sector, but also to higher education, about the limited evidence that there is need for any change and widespread concern that the impact of bringing in both GCSE and A-level changes at the same time is going to just wreck the English education system. "Part of the problem is a total misunderstanding and confusion over activities and information that is in the public domain," he said. Under the government's plans, teenagers will no longer take "modular" A-levels with exams throughout but "linear" A-levels with exams at the end of the two-year course. AS-levels will be separated from A-levels to form a qualification in their own right. Mr Nicholson said that there was an assumption that linearity was good, partly because some universities still operated a system of exams at the end of a three-year degree course. But he added that universities had "managed to cope with modularity". He said students also applied for degree courses with different types of qualifications, including the International Baccalaureate, the Cambridge Pre-U and A-levels. Mr Nicholson also raised concerns about the planned changes to the AS-level. "The loss of AS-levels will have tragic consequences for widening participation and access to higher education. "AS-levels are excellent because they give students a very clear indication of what they are capable of achieving. "The real danger is students will plough on believing that they may not be capable of applying to a highly selective course, but equally believing that they are capable of applying to a highly selective and competitive course. "Losing AS-levels will have a really significant result on the likelihood of students from a disadvantaged background progressing to higher education." Mr Nicholson also said there were misconceptions around the A-level subjects that Russell Group universities - which are considered among the best in the UK - required from prospective students. In 2009 - following calls for universities to be clearer about their admissions procedures - the Russell Group published a list of subjects that tended to be required more often than others. Mr Nicholson told Tuesday's forum:"We tried to respond and give advice. That however has been totally misinterpreted. It states very clearly in the document what the intention is. "People choose to ignore that and say what it's basically saying is here are the 12 subjects that will guarantee you a place at a Russell Group university. "That's total nonsense. If you believe that's the case then I'm sorry but you are deluded." He also said that no university required students to have the government's English Baccalaureate at GCSE. This covers English, maths, sciences, a language and history or geography. "If anything, with GCSEs, we much prefer students to have high grades across a range of subjects," Mr Nicholson said. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: "We are putting universities, not politicians, in charge of A-levels to ensure they prepare children for work and higher education. "According to [the exams watchdog] Ofqual, the clear majority of universities favour A-level predictions over AS-levels as an indicator of ability. "Returning A-levels to single exams will end the test treadmill in sixth-forms - something which many teachers complain about." </body>

      <title>Gove urged to monitor free schools</title>
      <description>The education secretary is urged to monitor free schools more closely after a Muslim faith school was closed temporarily because of safety concerns.</description>

      <body>Michael Gove has been urged to monitor free schools more closely after a Muslim faith school was closed temporarily because of safety concerns. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt wrote to Mr Gove saying he was concerned problems at Al-Madinah School revealed a "systemic complacency". The government said it was looking into the school before issues became public. A junior education minister warned the Derby free school it had 17 issues to address including poor standards. Free schools are state-funded schools set up by faith groups, parents, teachers and other individuals and groups. They are directly accountable to the Education Secretary as they are not within the local authority sphere of influence. Al-Madinah School was closed for seven days earlier this month after a single day of inspections by Ofsted which found incomplete records of child protection checks for staff. And concerns were raised about female teachers at the school being told to wear the hijab even if they were not Muslim. In his letter to the education secretary, Mr Hunt said: "In the coming days, we expect Ofsted to publish the inspection report on one of your flagship free schools, the Al-Madinah Free School in Derby. "You will be very aware of the high level of public interest and concern generated by the recent temporary closure of the school and the imminent findings of Her Majesty's Inspectorate. "As I am sure you will agree, there should be no excuse for underperformance in any school. But it is especially troubling that 400 pupils should be deprived of a week of schooling because a publicly funded free school failed in its duty to meet basic child safety requirements." He added: "Moreover, the parliamentary under-secretary of state for schools has recently acknowledged that the Al-Madinah Free School is 'delivering an unacceptably poor standard of education', and I am extremely concerned that this situation could be indicative of a systemic complacency on standards." Mr Hunt went on to ask whether Mr Gove was satisfied with current arrangements for spotting underperformance in free schools. He also asked the education secretary to explain how parents would be provided with a "firm guarantee that their children's education and safety is not being put at risk due to the inadequate oversight of your free school programme". The letter also highlighted claims there were warnings from Ofsted regarding potential issues with welfare, health and safety of pupils at the Derby school before it opened in September 2012. Mr Gove was asked to explain what steps were taken to ensure that these "warnings were heeded" and that "all issues were resolved before the school opened". The Department for Education did not address many of these questions in its statement, but it did say: "We were already investigating this school before allegations became public. We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection. "We have received a response from the Al-Madinah Education Trust. Any decisions made will take into account all the available evidence." The Al-Madinah school was among the first free schools in England with a Muslim ethos, catering for all reception, primary and secondary pupils. But concerns over the application of strict Islamic practices led to a scheduled full inspection being brought forward. A statement on the school website said: "Unsurprisingly, there has been a number of rumours circulating. "While unfortunate, my decision to close the school related to a short-term health and safety issue that has now been completely resolved and will not reoccur." The school has been given a deadline of 22 October to address nine further action points and must provide a plan setting out a clear management structure by the start of November. Ofsted is expected to publish its report on the school in the next week or so. </body>

      <description>Ofsted chief warns of weak leadership in children's services and irresponsible parents.</description>

      <body>"Manifestly and palpably weak" leadership and a high turnover of directors are undermining efforts to improve children's services in England, says Ofsted's chief inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw. There are 20 local authorities rated as inadequate for protecting children. Sir Michael branded Birmingham as an example of bad practice, which he called a "national disgrace". He suggested the local authority might need to be broken up. Sir Michael also called for a wider recognition of the impact of children's home environments, such as irresponsible and alcohol-dependent parents and living on streets lined with betting shops and fast-food shops. Presenting his annual report on social care, Sir Michael delivered a series of hard hitting messages about weaknesses in protecting children. Inspectors only rated four in 10 local authorities as "good" or better for safeguarding. It should be an "urgent priority" of government to examine the role of local authority safeguarding bodies, said Sir Michael. His inspectors had often reported major concerns about these bodies, he said. And he warned about the negative impact of too much "volatility" in the senior leadership in children's services. "One in three local authorities has had a change in their director of children's services last year alone. The combination of unstable communities and political and managerial instability in our social care services is a dangerous mix," said Sir Michael. He warned that poor leadership was often isolated from frontline staff, such as social workers, many of whom felt "profoundly undervalued". Sir Michael said that the average career span in social work was only eight years and the profession faced a "demographic timebomb". He delivered a stinging attack on Birmingham's services for children - accusing them of long-running failures in supporting the safety and well-being of young people in England's biggest authority. The city had a poor record on child mortality and child poverty, he said, and there had been repeated failings in inspections and inadequate serious case reviews. This was "failure of corporate governance on a grand scale", he said. Asked after his speech if he meant that the authority should be broken up, he said that was the implication of his argument. In response a Birmingham City Council spokesman said: "We are already on record as saying that we have failed to meet the basic expectation of keeping vulnerable children in this city safe. This is a long-standing problem which we acknowledge and the leader has said that improving children's services is his number one priority." "What we don't need, however, is simply a repetition of our failings without any proposed solutions," said the council spokesman. Sir Michael also warned of the destructive force of "social breakdown" on young lives and how they were let down by their families. "They lack more than money, they lack parents who will take responsibility," he said. There were 705,000 children living with alcohol-dependent parents and 130,000 in homes where there was domestic violence. "Compassion should not be about making excuses," said Sir Michael, who warned about the corrosive consequences of the "hollowing out and fragmentation" of families. He quoted Louise Casey, the so-called troubled families tsar, as warning that there was too much "pussyfooting around" in supporting families, with too many meetings and too little action. Debbie Jones, Ofsted's national director of social care, said that the child protection system was under "huge pressure", with rising volumes of work at a time when local authority budgets were under pressure. The 20 councils where the standard of child protection services has been judged "inadequate" by Ofsted are: Barnsley, Bexley, Birmingham, Blackpool, Calderdale, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire East, Cumbria, Devon, Doncaster, Herefordshire, Isle of Wight, Kingston upon Thames, Medway, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Rochdale, Sandwell, Slough and Somerset. </body>

      <title>Universities 'can drive economy'</title>
      <description>Universities should be brought into the heart of the economy and given funding to drive economic growth, a report urges.</description>

      <body>Universities should be brought into the heart of the economy and funded to stimulate growth, a report is urging. It says the government should put £1bn into what it calls Arrow Projects, to turn "globally competitive technological ideas into real business". Current funding streams are too complex, argues author Sir Andrew Witty, boss of GlaxoSmithKline. The government and the Confederation of British Industry welcomed the report. John Cridland, director general of the CBI, described Arrow Projects as a "great idea". Universities Minister David Willetts said the government would consider what recommendations to make following the publication. "We know that universities are engines of innovation and have an important role to play in driving our industrial strategy," said Mr Willetts. The report, entitled Encouraging a British Invention Revolution, says the UK is a world leader in technology and invention, adding that "the research strength of the UK's universities in an enormous national asset". But it warns: "We will have to work hard to maintain our position of strength in the face of increasing competition." In his foreword, Sir Andrew writes that UK universities have "an extraordinary wealth of ideas, technology and human energy - much of which is world-leading and capable of seeding not just new companies but whole industries". But without better-focused funding, organisation and collaboration, he says, there is a risk of delay and of "British inventions building foreign industries". He says a "thicket of complexity" in funding "leads to unnecessary hurdles for those striving to translate ideas to job-creating businesses". Arrow Projects are his plan for an taking ideas from "mind to factory" with a "globally competitive sense of timing and scale". If they were successful they "could herald a British invention revolution to rival the transformation witnessed in the 19th Century," Sir Andrew writes. He envisages the projects as large collaborations in technologically advanced fields. The partners would not necessarily be "geographically co-located", and would include a range of universities - not just leading research institutions - as well as industry, business and local and central government. The report says the government "will need to create a new funding stream to bring the Arrow Projects into being." This could be composed of both public and private money, from both new or existing sources and delivered perhaps in the form of block grants which would allow project managers to use their judgement as to how it is spent, it says. Universities and businesses would form themselves into consortiums to bid for the funding. The funding would be channelled through the lead university in each project. Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, said: "The future of the UK economy depends upon making the most of the knowledge, innovation and energy to be found in universities. This work is already happening but the report challenges us, quite rightly, to do more." Dr Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group of research universities, also welcomed the proposal: "Discoveries at our world-leading, research-intensive universities have generated billions over the years. "But it's vital for the UK's economy that groundbreaking discoveries make it all the way from idea to implementation and from prototype to profit. "Collaboration with business is a core part of the mission of all our academics. But we need to bridge the gap and help everyone work together." Mr Cridland added: "We also need to ensure that more mid-sized and smaller businesses benefit from the huge potential universities bring. "A single point of entry for companies wishing to engage with universities and a sharper focus on supporting innovation in mid-sized businesses are logical first steps." </body>

      <title>League tables measure eight subjects</title>
      <description>Secondary school league tables in England are to be based on progress in eight subjects, rather than focusing on C grades in five GCSEs.</description>

      <body>Secondary school league tables in England are to be re-designed to discourage an over-emphasis on pupils achieving C grades at GCSE, says Schools Minister David Laws. From 2016, schools will be measured on overall results in eight GCSE subjects. There will be four key league table measures, showing pupils' progress as well as final grades. Education Select Committee chairman Graham Stuart has hailed the change as an "educational breakthrough". Mr Stuart said it would remove the "damaging obsession" with the C grade boundary. Setting out the reforms in the House of Commons, Mr Laws said they would remove "perverse incentives for schools to act in a way which is not in the best interests of pupils". It will mean shifting away from the current league table system, where schools are ranked by the percentage of pupils achieving five GCSEs grades A* to C, including English and maths. There had been concerns that a disproportionate amount of attention is paid to pupils on this C/D borderline, to the detriment of pupils who achieve at a much higher or lower level. "This gives schools a huge incentive to focus excessively on the small number of pupils around the five Cs borderline. This is unfair to pupils with the potential to move from E grades to D grades, or from B grades to A grade," said Mr Laws. He told MPs that it could also conceal "coasting" schools in more affluent areas, rewarding them with high positions in the league tables without stretching their pupils to achieve their full potential. From 2016 there will be four league table measures for schools. It will show pupils' achievements across their best eight subjects - including English and maths, three core English Baccalaureate subjects including history, geography, physics, chemistry and languages and three other subjects which can include art, music, drama and business. This result will be shown as an average grade for the school, such as a B-. As well as showing GCSE results there will be a measure of progress, showing how pupils have advanced since taking tests at the end of primary school. This will be expressed as a score showing how much the results vary above or below expected levels. If schools achieve the expected levels they will score zero - and if they are below expected levels, they will have a minus score. There will be extra weighting for specific subjects, with English and maths worth double points. Other measures are the percentage of pupils achieving C grades or higher in English and maths and the proportion gaining the English Baccalaureate subjects, English, maths, history or geography, the sciences (including computing from next year) and a language. The revised league tables will mean changes to the way underperformance and minimum "floor targets" are measured. The new floor targets will be based on the amount of progress pupils should have made since primary school. Mr Laws defined the new floor standard as "progress half a grade lower than reasonable expectations. So, if pupils at a school are expected to average a B in their eight subjects, the school will be below the floor if they average less than four Bs and four Cs". In terms of how this threshold will be shown in the new-look tables, such a half grade below expectations would be expressed as -0.5. If schools perform above expectations in pupil progress, equivalent to a full grade above, or +1.0, they will not face an Ofsted inspection the following year. At present there are 195 schools below the minimum level of achievement, but Mr Law said that if the new plans were applied to current results the number of schools below the threshold would double. "The fact that the new accountability measures will put many more schools below the new floor targets will be devastating to many," said the National Union of Teacher's leader, Christine Blower. But she welcomed the "move away from a 'spotlight' on pupils on the C/D borderline. It still remains the case however that a league table and target culture will persist". Head teachers' leader Brian Lightman said there was much to welcome in the changes, including the shift away from focusing on the C grade boundary. But Mr Lightman, leader of the Association of School and College Leaders, said this was "seriously undermined by other ad hoc changes to the examination system". Mary Bousted, leader of the ATL teachers' union, backed the principle of "prioritising the progress schools make with their pupils rather than simply rewarding those with the top grades". But she cautioned that the measurements of progress depended on the reliability of Sats results as the starting point - saying that their validity "cannot be counted on". Mr Stuart welcomed the changes to the league table system: "These plans are an educational breakthrough that will blow away the damaging obsession with the C/D grade boundary and help every child achieve the best possible results." Chris Paterson, author of a report on school accountability for the think tank Centre Forum, said: "Getting the measure that drives school league tables right could be the single most important education reform of the coalition government." </body>

      <body>Record numbers of UK university students are opting to spend a year studying or working abroad, says the British Council. More than 14,500 UK students took part in the European Union's Erasmus student exchange scheme in 2012-13, the highest since it was launched in 1987. But the UK lags behind France, Germany and Spain, where almost three times as many students are on the scheme. The British Council says foreign study has been shown to boost job prospects. Ruth Sinclair-Jones, of the British Council, described the scheme as "an ideal way to learn another language and culture". "As the number of specialist foreign language courses decline in the UK, Erasmus is becoming even more essential. "The international experience offered through Erasmus has been shown to make a real difference in terms of people's employability." The British Council has managed Erasmus in the UK for the past six years. Since then, the number of UK students on the scheme has more than doubled, according to British Council data. The latest UK participation figures show a rise of 7% on the previous year. In all, more than 2.5 million students across Europe have taken part in the scheme. Despite the recent rise, the UK is still well behind other major European countries - the latest figures show 39,000 Spanish students took part in the scheme in 2011-12, along with 33,300 from Germany and 33,200 from France. Last year the University of Nottingham was the UK institution to send the largest number of students on to Erasmus exchanges, with 522 participants. The scheme is also popular among students at other members of the Russell Group of research based universities. Last year Leeds sent 459 students, Sheffield 447, Manchester 438 and Bristol 422. Although the numbers are rising across the UK, there has been particular success in Scotland, with 1,877 students taking part last year. Some 13% of Erasmus participants last year came from Scottish institutions, which represent just 8.5% of the UK student population. The University of Edinburgh was the most enthusiastic Erasmus participant in Scotland, with 356 students on the scheme. Vincenzo Raima, director of Nottingham's international office, said the university had set a target for 25% of its undergraduates to be taking part in some form of international scheme or experience by 2015-15. "All the evidence out there tells us that students who undertake international activities gain the additional skills employers are looking for," said Mr Raima. </body>

      <title>Muslim school changes headscarf rule</title>
      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby, which is threatened with closure, says it will support female staff who do not wish to wear head coverings.</description>

      <body>A Muslim free school in Derby has said it will support female staff who do not want to wear head coverings. It follows a letter warning the Al-Madinah School it faced closure unless discrimination against female staff and pupils stopped. Education Minister Lord Nash laid out 17 issues for the school to consider, which included an end to "unacceptable" teaching standards. The letter said if steps were not taken by Tuesday, funding would be pulled. Parent-governor Abdullah Shahjan told BBC Radio Derby: "We are amending policies to make sure we support staff, who if for their cultural, ethical, or faith do not wish to cover their hair." Another governor Fasal Hussain said: "We are very open, very flexible." However, with regard to Lord Nash's letter and female staff wearing head scarves he added: "We would have appreciated some consultation. "We have never received any complaints from our staff." One of the other concerns raised in the letter was that women and girls were being treated less favourably than men and boys. Head of Islamic studies, Mohammad Burhaan, said: "We are an Islamic school and if we were to discriminate against women in any way we wouldn't be faithful to our faith. "If you look at the tradition of Islam, it has a very rich history and heritage of female scholarship - both religious and in the field of science, languages and mathematics - we are very proud of that heritage. "If we were going to discriminate we would have applied to be a single-gender school from the outset." He said the chair of governors was female, most staff were female and most pupils were female. "I think actions speak louder than words and we can't give a bolder statement to our dedication to equality of gender than that," he said. During an earlier interview on Newsnight, Mr Burhaan said head scarves were the code of dress adopted by the school. "If you look at an air hostess, for example, a female wears a different code of dress. "We are not saying they are discriminated against, that's a choice made by the business," he said then. The government had told the school to write to all female members of staff telling them they did not have to wear a hijab if it was in conflict with their religion or beliefs. In the letter outlining concerns, Lord Nash wrote: "The trust has manifestly breached the conditions of its funding agreement by: "I will not tolerate breaches of the commitments you gave when entering into the funding agreement." He urged the school's trust to take five "urgent steps" by 15 October, including providing written confirmation that "you have ceased any practices and procedures that have as their reason, cause or effect that women and girls are treated less favourably than men and boys". The school has been given a deadline of 22 October to address nine further action points and must provide a plan setting out a clear management structure by the start of November. </body>

      <body>Labour is "on the side" of parents who want to set up schools and would not shut most existing free schools, the new shadow education secretary insists. Tristram Hunt told the BBC Labour backed "enterprise and innovation" when it came to increasing school places. He said a Labour government would push ahead with what it called parent-led academies in areas of educational need. Tory chairman Grant Shapps said Labour's policy was unchanged and it still opposed the "popular" schools. Free schools, set up by parents and other groups and operating outside local authority control, have been established under a policy pioneered by Education Secretary Michael Gove. More than 170 have been opened across England since September 2011. Labour has been accused by the government of sending out mixed messages about the party's support, opposing their roll-out nationally but backing schools locally. Mr Hunt, who has just taken over from Stephen Twigg as the party's education spokesman, said he regretted previously describing free schools as a "vanity project for yummy mummies". He made the comments in 2010 shortly after becoming an MP. Mr Hunt told BBC One's Andrew Marr programme Labour would not open new free schools "along the Michael Gove model", but that the bulk of existing free schools would be kept open as his party wanted to "keep the good free schools". Citing the case of the Al-Madinah free school in Derby, which was closed for a week earlier this month on the first day of an Ofsted inspection, Mr Hunt said Labour would not allow schools to become an "ideological experiment". Education Minister Lord Nash has warned the school would be closed unless "unacceptable" teaching standards improved. Its acting head teacher said there were areas the school needed to address and it was co-operating with Ofsted. "What is going on with the Al-Madinah school is a terrifying example of the mistakes of Michael Gove's education policy," he said. New schools, he added, should only be opened in areas where there was a shortage of places, where "properly qualified" staff could be recruited and where institutions were financially accountable. Under Labour's plans, parent-led academies would enable parent groups and other organisations to set up schools outside local authority control, although local authorities would have greater powers to intervene when there were concerns about standards. "If you are a group of parents, social entrepreneurs and teachers interested in setting up a school in areas where you need new school places, then the Labour government will be on your side. "We are in favour of enterprise and innovation." But a Conservative Party spokesman said shadow chancellor Ed Balls had made it clear in a speech in June that the party would curb new schools in areas where they was an "excess" of places. Mr Balls had suggested a future Labour government would prioritise resources on areas where school places were in "short supply". Mr Shapps told the BBC: "This is the same old Labour policy. Free schools will only be allowed in specific circumstances in specific areas with a whole load of bureaucracy attached. "Free schools have been driving up standards. They are hugely popular with parents and up to now Labour have fought tooth and nail against them including voting against them and what they said today has changed absolutely nothing." Journalist Toby Young, who helped set up a free school in west London, said Mr Hunt had been "less than candid" about Labour's policy as it was considering granting councils the power of veto over free schools in their boroughs. Writing in his blog for the Daily Telegraph, Mr Young - who has said he is considering of applying to be a Conservative candidate at the next election - said this would be a "retrograde step" since councils would be unlikely to approve new schools close to existing ones which were under-performing. Mr Hunt said there needed to be more focus on vocational education with support for further education colleges and apprenticeships in industry. </body>

      <title>Meeting over funding of NI schools</title>
      <description>People give their views about how schools are funded at a public meeting in Belfast.</description>

      <body>People have been giving their views about how schools are funded at a public meeting in Belfast. In June, the education minister proposed changes to the Common Funding Scheme, which determines how funds are allocated to Northern Ireland schools. The proposals had been brought forward by an independent panel of experts who examined the current scheme. They found it was outdated, too complicated and was failing pupils. The panel recommended a simpler funding formula and financial incentives so that smaller schools are better off if they join with schools nearby. The meeting on Monday evening was attended by about 40 people. The majority of those were teachers, with a number of parents there as well. Concerns were raised at the meeting about how the funding changes are implemented. A Department of Education spokesperson said: "When the minister set out the way ahead for how local schools are funded, he undertook to gather the views of everyone who might be affected, or with an interest, who wishes to have their say. "Schools already have a mechanism for responding to the consultation, but, in keeping with the minister's views, we wanted to be able to engage with a wider audience. "This public meeting in Belfast follows one held already in Omagh and enables those who wish to put their views across verbally to have their say. "It forms part of the wider consultation process that has included an online response form, children's and young people's versions and focussed engagement with parents, children and young people." The consultation closes on Friday 18 October. </body>

      <title>Disabled child support review urged</title>
      <description>The government is urged by the children's commissioner for England to undertake a review of the adequacy of support for disabled children.</description>

      <body>Ministers are being urged to review care provided for children with disabilities following research into the adequacy of support for families. Children's commissioner for England Maggie Atkinson called the findings "heart-rending" and "disturbing". The report suggested some families were unable to afford basic necessities for "a dignified life". The Department for Work and Pensions said the report contained "a small sample, presenting a partial picture". The study, carried out by the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) for the children's commissioner, found evidence that poverty meant some disabled children were not living lives that met international human rights standards. Ms Atkinson said the research findings were "not an easy read". "This is about voicelessness and powerlessness, as well as about making ends meet," she said. "It's very poignant and very difficult to hear the stories. "Money issues are very real and very challenging, but parents are equally saying they have little or no say in the ways services are planned and provided, from transport to access to youth, or play or leisure which is properly adapted for one's disability." The research was based on interviews and group discussions with 78 disabled children and young people and 17 parents. It was co-led by a team of 11 disabled children and young people working with the university. A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions rejected some of the conclusions. "In fact, independent reports show how we are world leaders in support for disabled people with the UK's spending on disability-related benefits a fifth higher than the EU average. "The UK is also acknowledged as a world leader in supporting independent living for disabled people, having the best overall rating of 55 countries. "We continue to spend around £50bn a year on disabled people and their services and our reforms will make sure the billions spent give more targeted support to those who need it most." Ms Atkinson acknowledged the government's response, but stressed some of the "personal stories" she had heard painted a different picture. She said: "I would like some of the officials who have no doubt written that statement to come and meet some of the young people, who will tell the very true story of living with a disability on a very low income, and then I would ask them to say that again. "There is a mum quoted in the survey, who because her child needs an adapted home, including a multi-sensory environment... was persuaded to make sure that was available. "She will be paying for it until November 2022. "There is also a young woman going through everything that adolescence brings with it, who needs incontinence pads. "The benefits pay for four-a-day, she needs 10. That is not human dignity and it is not human rights either." Despite the criticism, researchers found "many examples" of disabled children receiving good care and services which they said "demonstrate how low income does not have to be a barrier". But evidence was also found of inadequate services, compounding the problems of some low income families. The authors said that although families with disabled children often have rights to welfare payments and practical support, their basic incomes often do not cover the extra costs of raising and caring for a disabled child. The team analysed three United Nations treaty documents: the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on Persons with Disabilities and the International Covenant on Economic and Social Rights. Between them these treaties specify individuals' rights to food, clothes and heating, to live independently, to be able to decide where to live, to live in their local communities and to the support and services they need to be able to do that. The researchers found the lives lived by some disabled children and young people did not meet these basic rights. "There were accounts of some disabled children, young people and their parents not being able to heat their homes properly or afford adequate clothing and food," said the paper. "Some were not informed or involved in decisions about changes to where they lived. "Some experienced delays in adaptations being made to their homes and some did not have enough space nor support for independent living." </body>

      <title>Stones and apples thrown at university reformer</title>
      <description>The tough struggle to modernise Kurdistan's education system</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23977422</url>

      <body>Prof Dlawer Ala'Aldeen had tomatoes, stones and apples thrown at him. He faced countless demonstrations. The reason for this hostility, facing the microbiologist from the University of Nottingham, was his controversial attempt to reform the university system in his birthplace of Kurdistan. Prof Ala'Aldeen was the architect of plans to improve the quality and to internationalise higher education in Iraqi Kurdistan. He says he was up against "deeply entrenched interests, people, institutions and long stagnant cultures". The region, autonomous for two decades in the wake of the Gulf War, had inherited a post-Saddam university system that Prof Ala'Aldeen has described as "grossly outdated" and designed for a closed, centralised country. In 2009 Prof Ala'Aldeen was given a secondment away from his job as professor of clinical microbiology at Nottingham University in the UK. He stepped from academic life in the English midlands into the role of Kurdistan's higher education minister, a post he held until last year. Prime Minister Barham Salih, a good friend, chose him for his knowledge of the higher education system and the series of critical articles on education and governance he had written in the years up to his appointment. Barham Salih's election manifesto had included significant support for higher education and training to support Kurdistan's large population of under 20 year olds. There were already plans for more scholarships to send talented students to study overseas. Within a week of being appointed, Prof Ala'Aldeen had written up a radical vision document and it was quickly endorsed by the cabinet. Higher education in Kurdistan was suffering a major crisis of quality, capacity and infrastructure. There was a consensus in support of reform and it helped that Prof Ala'Aldeen had been very critical of the government in the past. The reforms, which planned to improve the quality and accreditation of university teachers, brought considerable opposition from student and teacher organisations as well as businesses linked with the burgeoning market in private universities. Several new private universities were threatened with closure, much to the anger of their staff and prospective students who had paid fees for their courses. "Many teachers had been licensed prematurely. There were 11 private universities when I started with 18 more waiting to be opened. These mushrooming private colleges were relying on the same pool of resources as the public universities which lacked staff and facilities," Prof Ala'Aldeen says. The problem of staffing was particularly acute in medicine, pharmacy and dentistry and in postgraduate studies. But Prof Ala'Aldeen faced protests and opposition. He was accused of trying to transplant the UK system onto Kurdistan, something he vehemently denies since he was educated and worked in his home region, before coming to study in the UK. "I knew the system from the inside and studied what had happened in similar countries. I wanted to apply international principles of quality, but tailor-made to Kurdish traditions," he says. He responded by redoubling his efforts to communicate the purpose of the reforms, which also included curriculum development, moving beyond a single teacher delivering a lecture to a class, the introduction of an electronic admissions system and reforming the teaching of PhDs. In the end, the government closed three private universities as well as five health-related colleges, three pharmacy colleges and two dentistry ones. "If we had allowed the system to keep evolving as it was it would have taken at least a generation to fix it - a generation would have been wasted. We knew we had to act fast. It was a risky policy, but it would have been far riskier to do nothing," he says. The speed of his action was criticised as were aspects of the efforts to improve teaching standards, such as student feedback being used to measure teacher performance and pay. There was also opposition to teachers being asked to engage in professional development once a week. Prof Brendan O'Leary, director of the programme in ethnic conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a longer process might have worked better. But he says it was against a background when unprecedented changes were happening in Kurdish society as the region opened up to foreign investment. "The Kurdistan region is going through a difficult and fast-paced transformation. "Ideally a long and rich discussion is needed to agree new institutional conditions to enable higher education to flourish in a region emerging from decades of destruction, war, genocide, internal fighting, academic isolation and lack of resources. "University and institutional reforms are more likely to succeed if all the stakeholders have clear ideas on what to do, when, and at what pace. One should not be surprised if people with vested interests fear reforms," said Prof O'Leary. Thomas Hill, assistant professor at New York University Center for Global Affairs, adds: "I do not believe there is consensus even now that the reforms the former minister wanted to implement would have been in the best interest of the Kurdistan region. "There are many, many people with very conservative views within the higher education sector in the Kurdistan region and many did not and do not like the progressive path the former minister was plotting." There were areas in which vested interests remained unmoved. Prof Ala'Aldeen could not increase the independence of universities. The government continues to choose university leaders and universities have been totally dependent on government funding. Prof Ala'Aldeen put together draft legislation on institutional autonomy, but says the challenge to the status quo was too great to push it through. He is in close touch with the current government and is pleased that the reforms to improve quality have been maintained, despite the fact that there is still not consensus in favour of them, and says the scholarship programme is already making a difference. "Almost 3,000 students have studied abroad, the majority in the UK. Half of these are or will be back by the end of this year. They will provide leadership and bring a breath of fresh air. They will link their institutions to the outside world and break Kurdistan's academic isolation." Although Kurdistan has its own particular circumstances, Prof Ala'Aldeen says that the problems facing the university system are not unique - and that the model for modernisation could be applied elsewhere in the Middle East. "The problems are generic and the solutions can be implemented anywhere in the world." Commentators on Kurdistan's politics agree. Prof O'Leary says: "The Kurdistan region, Iraq and several other states in the Middle East are going through dramatic changes, and in some cases, deeply regrettable authoritarian restorations. "Most institutions are highly politicised in these societies. If the Kurdistan region can successfully reform its education system, including higher education, it can provide a model for the wider Middle East." </body>

      <title>Harvard plans to boldly go with 'Spocs'</title>
      <description>Harvard develops the next big thing for online learning. Is this the real deal?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24166247</url>
      <date>1380062273</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/69961000/jpg/_69961608_iphone624.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Keep up, keep up. If you've only just caught on to the concept of online university courses called Moocs, then you're in danger of falling behind again. Harvard, one of the world's most influential universities, is moving on to Spocs - which stands for small private online courses. Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go". And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc". Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up. Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection. But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered. Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts. The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted. It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses. At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds? Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands. It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits. Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model. Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students. Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials. Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information". These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work. Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus. It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences. Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX. He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility". And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution". "The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era." "What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue. It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications? The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says. "It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area." There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning. A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs. The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue". The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time. Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus. "What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?" If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"? Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective. Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests. "The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better." "Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem." </body>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses. Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers. The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses. It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts. Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar". He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas. The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet. The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project. The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students. There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year. In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications. But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them. It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options. When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations. FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution. They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students. Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront". But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs. Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming. "Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor. "Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities. "Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study." Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course. FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting. He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture". This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content. This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University. "Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean. There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England. Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford. Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities. These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates. It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online. These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams. Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard. On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses. But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses. Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT. He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online. Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance. "The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow. "The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system." Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets." </body>

      <title>Gordon Brown's Syrian refugee school plan</title>
      <description>Syria's refugee crisis is also threatening to become a long-term education disaster.</description>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks. "A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon. As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school. Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks. It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school. But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (£319m). The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy. This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds. Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived. The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes. Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population. But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling. The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war. Forty years ago Médecins Sans Frontières established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones. Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief. Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations. Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence. On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees. In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds. It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world." </body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>

      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education? In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show. This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead. Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course. Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show. A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics". Showbiz lessons The show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience". She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show". The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids. It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive. This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week. Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education. And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning. Dumbing down? This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection. There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time. But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus? "When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university. "The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show." Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples. "In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course." Apocalypse studies Josh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show. "This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental." "This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters." Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning? "Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says. He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet. "The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says. Personal learning For the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online. "The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble. "The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that." These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students. Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities. But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected. William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs. And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate. They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says. Spoiler alert Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses. Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary. "The student must be able to sift the evidence. "For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says. Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment. But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected. With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert. </body>

      <title>Harvard tops global CEO league table</title>
      <description>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most common place to have studied.</description>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied. The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies. There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea. The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place. This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies. One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard. This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone. This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (£20bn' 23.5bn euro). But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings. Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique. It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo. Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe. In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place. But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities. Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin. Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart. </body>

      <title>The scientists who escaped the Nazis</title>
      <description>A first-hand memory of the scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany</description>

      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority. The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel. They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history. Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research. The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers. Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule. He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics. Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis? "Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months." Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him. There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav. The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more". It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating. "They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way." When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders. "My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey." While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain. The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics. It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain. It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman. Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933. He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil. "It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people." He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living". The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs. This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy. According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939. Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard. There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him. Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort. In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won. Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen. There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake. In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen. Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls. But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue. Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism. What lessons should be learned from all this? Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year. It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions". There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said. The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world. But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve. His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society. His father, remembered for his science research, played Bach on the piano every day. These were internationalists, their ideas and research moving across national and political boundaries. Such a world proved fragile in the face of the Nazis. And Gustav Born says people can too often overlook that Germany had still been a young country in the 1930s, little more than 60 years old, and that it hadn't built the institutions able to resist its own "militaristic and nationalistic" tendencies. He is very much aware that he is now one of the few remaining people who can talk first-hand about such a legacy. "I'm sad that it almost ends with me. "I want them not to forget that things like this, the suppression of a country by a gang of murderous crooks and the victimisation of people of good nature and good intention, it could happen again." </body>

      <title>Education is a 'security issue', says UN</title>
      <description>Unesco chief says even though pledge for education for all will be missed, huge progress has been achieved.</description>

      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says. Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school. The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education. But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success. In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling. After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely. "By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco. But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million. "If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%." Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom. Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate. So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova. It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places. Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding. In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers. But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance. Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments. "Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism. "The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society." The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says. Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general. "Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis. "But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking. "We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education." Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls. Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls. Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem. "One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says. "It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn." And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal. "It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy. "There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect. "This is the best thing that could happen to humanity." The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute. A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school. It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong. A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict. In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls. In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed. The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students. Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed. Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward. This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results". But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school. It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow. "In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument." </body>

      <body>Slang such as "ain't", "innit" and "coz" has been banned from a school in south London to try to help students find future employment. Harris Academy Upper Norwood said it implemented the initiative to allow its students to "express themselves confidently and appropriately". Pupils heard using "informal language" will be asked to "reflect" on it. Other banned words include "like", "bare" and "extra" and the phrases "you woz" and "we woz". Starting sentences with "basically" and ending them with "yeah" is also considered to be too informal at the Croydon school. In a statement, the school said: "In addition to giving students the teaching they need to thrive academically, we want them to develop the soft skills they will need to compete for jobs and university places. "This particular initiative is just one of the many ways in which we are building the vocabulary of our students and giving them the skills they need to express themselves confidently and appropriately for a variety of audiences." Terry Victor, editor of the New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English said: "It's wrong. "You cannot censor a young person's language, they're not talking about words that are offensive, they're talking about some of the words that politicians use. "[The word] 'ain't' was around in the 19th Century, people like Dickens used it... and how many politicians have you heard say "basically" to begin a sentence? "Yes, it's irritating but it's part of deliberate language." Harris Academy Upper Norwood opened last month, replacing a secondary school that was in special measures. </body>

      <title>Clangers to make TV return</title>
      <description>Beloved children's show the Clangers is to make a return to television, with a new series in production for CBeebies in 2015.</description>

      <body>Beloved children's show, the Clangers is being resurrected, with a new series in production for CBeebies in 2015. Debuting in 1969, the show told the tale of a race of knitted aliens eking out a threadbare existence on a cold blue planet, not far from Earth. The pink, mouse-like creatures lived in craters covered by dustbin lids - whose noisy "clang" gave the show its name. Co-creator Peter Firmin said the new series would involve "great storytelling with lots of heart". The puppet-maker, whose other credits include Ivor The Engine and Bagpuss, promised the new series would be markedly different from the crude, jerky animation of the original. "When you watch the original Clangers you have to make allowances for the limitations of the animation techniques when it was made," he said in a statement. "It was magical for its time, but this is a new Clangers for a new age!" Firmin dreamt up the Clangers with puppeteer and writer Oliver Postgate, who also narrated the series. It was first shown on BBC1 in November 1969, just four months after Nasa's moon landing, and one episode even showed the Clangers making inventive use of a flag left behind by some astronauts. The characters even appeared in Doctor Who - watched by the Doctor's arch-nemesis The Master in the 1972 story, The Sea Devils. Although the creatures communicated in a spooky, swooping whistle, Postgate later revealed that their "dialogue" was written out in full, in English, and often included swear words. On receiving the scripts, the BBC objected, telling him, "Darling, you can't say that on children's television," he told Clive Banks' science fiction website. "I said, 'It's not going to be said, it's going to be whistled,' but [the BBC] just said, 'But people will know!'" Eventually, Postgate won - and the Clangers apparently swear like troopers, for those who can translate. Postgate's son Daniel is writing the scripts for the show's 21st Century incarnation, which he described as a "labour of love". "I've always loved Clangers," he said. "I was about five years old when it was made - just the right age. "The new Clangers is not something we've rushed into. It has been carefully considered." CBeebies controller Kay Benbow added: "Nostalgia is a funny thing, and we always think very carefully about remakes or re-imaginings of classic children's programmes. "The Clangers is a programme that has an enduring magic. The new proposition has been built firmly upon the joyful foundations of the original, and will be produced by a team of exceptional talent which includes the extraordinary Peter Firmin." The £5m production is already under way, and is being co-produced by US pre-school TV channel Sprout, which will broadcast the programme in North America. </body>

      <body>There are fears some children with suspected autism are missing out on a specialist education because waiting times for diagnosis are increasing. In the Hywel Dda local health board area, 311 children have been diagnosed but a further 340 are still waiting to be assessed. Appropriate education provision is difficult without a correct diagnosis. In 2012, BBC Wales found some children were waiting longer than seven years for a diagnosis. According to figures obtained by BBC Wales Today almost 4,000 children in Wales have been diagnosed with autism - two thirds of those children are in mainstream education. But the programme, which will be broadcast on Friday at 18:30 BST on BBC One Wales, spoke to the National Autistic Society which said more than half of of those with autism had waited more than two years to be diagnosed. Nine-year-old Tom Fairburn, from Pembrokeshire, has a chromosome condition called 47 XYY syndrome, which means he has an extra Y chromosome. As a result Tom has learning difficulties. But when Tom was seven his mother, Samantha, suspected he had Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Nearly three years later, Tom is still waiting for a diagnosis. His mother said Tom's story was typical for the area. "I think everybody is in the same position, I think everybody just wants their children to be seen," said Ms Fairburn. She called for better training and facilities in schools as well as better support from the education and health authorities. "When he was in junior school I raised my concerns that there was no way he was going to cope in mainstream and then when they did open a unit it was basically just a classroom which they called a unit," Ms Fairburn said. "They didn't have the facilities for children with special needs - no sensory room, no quiet areas and the space was quite small. Children with autism like space." Ms Fairburn called for teachers to receive more training on how to manage children with autism. "I know autistic children are different but a lot of their ways are the same and I think a lot more training should be given - and to teachers in these units," she said. "In his school I felt that they thought he was naughty and, to be honest, I think that they couldn't cope with him and they didn't want him in the school... I think Tom felt like that as well." Meleri Thomas, from the National Autistic Society Cymru, said more needed to be done to help children like Tom. "It is quite worrying local authorities don't know exactly how many children are waiting for a diagnosis because if they don't know that then they can't know how to plan for provision and what kind of provision is needed," she said. "The more forward planning they can do the better it would be in the longer term and for the children in their local authority areas." A spokesman from Pembrokeshire council said: "There has been considerable development of specialist provision in response to a substantial increase in need. "We currently have specialist provision for 60 children which is more than in most authorities. "We are working closely with parents of children with ASD to ensure that we develop both specialist provision and improve this capacity of mainstream schools to meet the needs of all children with ASD." A spokeswoman for Hywel Dda said it expects to take on more staff in January to cut waiting times. "The health board is committed to reducing the waiting times for ASD diagnosis across the Hywel Dda area, focusing initially on Pembrokeshire and will be employing more staff to achieve this," she said. "The health board is also working with the Welsh government on the refresh of the all Wales ASD strategy to ensure in future that the significant issues facing the service currently are addressed in a sustainable manner." More on this story will be broadcast on BBC Wales Today at 18:30 BST on Friday. </body>

      <description>Evangelical Christian groups intent on converting pupils are being allowed into state schools claims a report.</description>

      <body>Evangelical Christian groups intent on converting pupils are being allowed into state schools claims a report. The National Secular Society (NSS) says some groups are holding assemblies and bible clubs in schools in England. The NSS has written to the Education Secretary Michael Gove calling for national guidance on external visitors, particularly from religious groups. The government said it had not seen any evidence to support the claims and had not received any complaints. The report says there has been "a marked increase in the number of parents contacting the National Secular Society with concerns about external visitors to schools exposing their children to unwelcome and wholly inappropriate religious evangelism and proselytisation". It added: "We have investigated this and found an abundance of material showing that the parents' concerns were not isolated instances." The report says that in many cases, evangelical Christian organisations offer to provide religious education and school worship. It claims that the legal obligation on schools to provide religious education and a daily act of worship has provided "a foot in the door" to some organisations with evangelistic intentions. The report suggests that shortfalls in religious education provision, recently highlighted in a report from Ofsted, are leading head teachers to accept help from external religious groups and adds that some heads are "insufficiently discerning about the external groups they are allowing into their schools". The letter also asks the Department for Education to ensure that guidance to schools on visits from religious groups "makes clear that schools must not offer opportunities to groups seeking to evangelise". The NSS says its investigation was prompted after it was contacted by parents, some of whom had themselves written to the schools and to the Department for Education about their concerns. One parent said he had become aware "quite by chance" of regular visits by an evangelical group to his child's non-religious primary school in Sheffield. He complains that the group "adheres to a profoundly conservative and avowedly missionary agenda". Another complained that his child had been told the creation story from Genesis was "factual" during visits to a primary school in the West Midlands from a local minister. Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: "Religious education must be clearly delineated as such. "A line is crossed when religious positions such as creationism are taught as scientific theories for example. Neither are schools places for proselytisation without the explicit and informed consent of parents." A spokeswoman for the DfE said if parents had concerns about visitors to their child's school they should make a formal complaint to the school. "State schools cannot teach creationism as scientific fact," added the spokeswoman. "They must offer a broad and balanced curriculum and meet their obligations under equalities legislation. Schools have a responsibility under law to ensure children are insulated from political activity and campaigning. "Schools are required to safeguard the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils. "Ofsted inspections include a focus on this to enable them to identify any inappropriate practice." Paul Bate of the Association of Christian Teachers and a former head of a faith school said: "Some schools, including faith schools, have a clear statement in their articles prohibiting staff from proselytising within the school. "Indeed, the faith school where I was head had such a statement within their articles and the RE curriculum was based around the teaching of philosophy, ethics, and giving the students an understanding of all faiths - which included secularism." </body>

      <title>Thousands of teenagers fail three Rs</title>
      <description>Tens of thousands of teenagers in England do not have at least a GCSE C-grade in English and maths by the time they are 18, new figures suggest.</description>

      <body>Tens of thousands of teenagers in England do not have at least a C-grade at GCSE in English and maths by the time they are 18, new figures suggest. And most who do not get a good grade in these key subjects by 16 then drop them. The figures are revealed in new government statistics. From now on, all teenagers will have to continue studying maths and English if they do not get at least a C-grade. The statistics, which have been published for the first time and are described as "experimental" by government officials, show that in 2009-10, about one in three young people (220,000) had not gained a grade A* to C in English by the age of 16. Of these, about 34,000 (15%), went on to re-take the GCSE after 16. About half of those then got at least a C. The figures are similar for maths. Schools minister David Laws said: "English and maths are what employers demand before all other subjects - if young people want to get on in life, they must be able to show they have good literacy and numeracy. "These figures expose the vast number of young people allowed to give up these subjects after so nearly achieving the level employers demand. "With just a bit more teaching, these students could have achieved the grades that would make all the difference to their job prospects." The figures come days after a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said literacy and numeracy rates of England's 16- to 24-year-olds were among the lowest in the developed world. Among 16-year-olds in England, only six in 10 achieve the government's minimum target of five good GCSEs including English and maths. Under changes introduced last month, teenagers now have to stay in some form of education or training until they are 17, although this may be work-based. This is due to rise to 18 in 2015. Ministers say they are writing to 12 local councils who are not tracking whether 16- to 18-year-olds are in education or training. New figures show that nationally, 88% of 16- and 17-year-olds were in education or training in June, up 1% on 2012. But the government said there were differences between areas and some councils were poor at tracking what many teenagers of this age group were doing. </body>

      <title>Inspectors attack prison education</title>
      <description>Ofsted inspectors have strongly criticised the standards of education and training in England's prisons.</description>

      <body>Ofsted inspectors have strongly criticised standards of education and training in England's prisons. The watchdog says it is unacceptable that not one prison has been rated "outstanding" for education in the past four years and only one in three is rated "good". At Wormwood Scrubs jail in London, Ofsted chiefs said if the figures related to schools there would be a "national outcry". Ministers say reforms are under way. In a speech at the prison, Matthew Coffey, national director of further education and skills at Ofsted, said the aim of training and education in jail should be to make people less likely to go back to crime when they got out. "This year's annual lecture aims to focus on how we can reduce the high re-offending rates that are nearly 50% for adult prisoners and 72% for juveniles," he said. "The aim is to reduce the number of re-offenders by focusing on rehabilitation in prisons through better employer engagement and better teaching and training." Levels of education among prisoners are generally much lower than in the population as a whole. Some studies suggest half of men in UK jails and nearly three-quarters of female prisoners have no qualifications at all, while about half have literacy skills below that of most eleven-year-olds. Many have been expelled from school. Mr Coffey said: "Far too many prisoners leave prison without employability skills, meaning they are less likely to find a job. Research shows that being in employment is one of the key factors that can reduce the risk of re-offending by between 30% and 50%. However, examples of good training provision in prisons were all too scarce. "Clearly, reducing the number of those re-offending is in everyone's interests. Every prisoner costs the taxpayer the same as sending a child to Eton, around £34,000 per year. We must now focus on improvement of prisoners' vocational and employability skills to ensure we support them on their journey out of prison and into employment to break the cycle of re-offending." He added that there were "outstanding examples" of prisons working with employers, education providers and other bodies to help prisoners develop vocational skills, but that those examples, were "all too scarce". Education in prisons in England and Wales is provided by private bodies which bid for contracts. Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright said: "Re-offending rates have been too high for too long and we are introducing significant reforms to the way offenders are rehabilitated and managed in the community. "We are committed to improving education in prison and are working with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Skills Funding Agency to develop prisoner learning." In most countries in the European Union, only about one in four adult prisoners takes part in education, according to a report for the EU published earlier this year, out of 640,000 inmates. In England and Wales, the proportion is higher, with an estimated 42% receiving some kind of prison education, which has to be provided by law. The EU report said prisons were all too often "environments for negative learning" when they could be offering people a second chance. According to the University and College Union, which represents many prison teachers and trainers, the "constant re-tendering" for education contracts brings problems, including a high turnover of staff and instability. They say because providers are paid by results, some teachers feel under pressure to limit courses to certain offenders and those in for longer terms. </body>

      <title>Toddler brain scan language insight</title>
      <description>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest.</description>

      <body>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest. Environmental influences have their biggest impact before the age of four, as the brain's wiring develops to process new words, say UK and US scientists. The research in The Journal of Neuroscience suggests disorders causing language delay should be tackled early. It also explains why young children are good at learning two languages. The scientists, based at King's College London, and Brown University, Rhode Island, studied 108 children with normal brain development between the ages of one and six. They used brain scans to look at myelin - the insulation that develops from birth within the circuitry of the brain. To their surprise, they found the distribution of myelin is fixed from the age of four, suggesting the brain is most plastic in very early life. Any environmental influences on brain development will be strongest in infanthood, they predict. This explains why immersing children in a bilingual environment before the age of four gives them the best chance of becoming fluent in both languages, the research suggests. It also suggests that there is a critical time during development when environmental influence on cognitive skills may be greatest. Dr Jonathan O'Muircheartaigh, from King's College London, led the study. He told the BBC: "Since our work seems to indicate that brain circuits associated with language are more flexible before the age of four, early intervention for children with delayed language attainment should be initiated before this critical age. "This may be relevant to many developmental disorders, such as autism, since delayed language is a common early trait." Early childhood is a time when language skills develop very rapidly. Babies have a vocabulary of up to 50 words at 12 months but by the age of six this has expanded to about 5,000 words. Language skills are localised in the frontal areas of the left-hand side of the brain. The researchers therefore expected more myelin to develop in the left-hand side of the brain, as the children learned more language. In fact, they found it remained constant, but had a stronger influence on language ability before the age of four, suggesting there is a crucial window for interventions in developmental disorders. "This work is important as it is the first to investigate the relationship between brain structure and language across early childhood and demonstrate how this relationship changes with age," said Dr Sean Deoni from Brown University, a co-researcher on the study. "This is important since language is commonly altered or delayed in many developmental disorders, such as autism." Commenting on the study, Prof Dorothy Bishop of the department of Developmental Neuropsychology at the University of Oxford said the research added important new information about early development of connections in brain regions important for cognitive functions. "There is suggestive evidence of links with language development but it is too early to be confident about functional implications of the findings," she said. "Ideally we would need a longitudinal study following children over time to track how structural brain changes relate to language function." The study was funded by the National Institutes for Mental Health (US) and the Wellcome Trust (UK). </body>

      <title>Baby Peter mother 'can be released'</title>
      <description>The Parole Board says it has directed the release of the mother of Baby Peter, Tracey Connelly.</description>

      <body>The mother of Baby Peter, Tracey Connelly, should be released from jail, the Parole Board has said. She was jailed indefinitely, with a recommended minimum term of five years, in May 2009, for causing or allowing her son's death in north London. A Parole Board panel recommended her release from prison following a second review of her case. The board said arrangements and the date of the release were a matter for Justice Secretary Chris Grayling. A spokesman for Mr Grayling said the Parole Board's decision was final. A statement from the board said: "We can confirm that a three-member panel of the board has directed the release of Tracey Connelly. "Tracey Connelly first became eligible for parole in August 2012 and at that time a Parole Board panel made no recommendation to release." Peter died on 3 August 2007 at home in Haringey after months of abuse. He had more than 50 injuries, despite being on the at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, police and health professionals over eight months. Connelly was jailed with her boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen, who were convicted at trial of the same offence. Barker was jailed for life with a minimum of 10 years for raping a two-year-old girl and given a 12-year term to run concurrently for his "major role" in Peter's death. Owen was jailed indefinitely with a minimum three-year term but later won an appeal to lower it to a fixed six-year term. He was freed in August 2011 but was then recalled to prison in April this year. When making its decision, the Parole Board will take into account the nature of the offence, the prisoner's offending history, the prisoner's progress in prison and any statements made on behalf of the victim. Reports from psychologists, probation officers and prison officers are also taken into account. Connelly will remain on licence for the rest of her life and if she breaches any of the conditions, she would most likely be recalled to custody. Conditions can include curfews, restrictions on movements and frequent meetings with an offender manager, said a Ministry of Justice spokesman. </body>

      <title>Why did it go wrong at Al-Madinah?</title>
      <description>What does the Al-Madinah case say about free schools?</description>

      <body>Described as "dysfunctional" and "in chaos", there can be no doubt that the problems at the Al-Madinah School go right to its core. Rated inadequate in all four inspection areas, Ofsted said problems at the Derby school were "myriad". Not only does it lack the basic structures needed to operate, it is said to be close to "collapsing". Al-Madinah is the second free school to be put into special measures, after Discovery Free School in May 2013. A further five out of the 24 inspected so far have been labelled "requiring improvement" - the next worse category. But then it is only two years into the programme. Across England the latest Ofsted figures show that 2% of state schools are in special measures - 383 out of 21,186 inspections. But no up-and-running free school has unravelled quite so publicly as this Derby-based Muslim faith school. It started with claims about female staff being required to wear hijabs, Islamic headscarves, but the focus has shifted to the "unacceptable" level of education the government and inspectors now say it is providing. The key thing that makes this Ofsted report stand out, is the fact that the findings come just a year after the school opened. Most schools that deteriorate tend to do so over a much longer period of time. And many of the problems it highlights seem to have implications for the particular nature of free schools and the extra freedoms they are allowed. The report's second line says: "This is a school which has been set up and run by representatives of the community with limited knowledge and experience." Education Secretary Michal Gove argued that taking schools out of the hands of bureaucrats would liberate innovators to push up standards through reform and experimentation. But the Ofsted findings in this case reflect exactly what detractors of such DIY school projects feared would happen. They asked how people who knew little about education could set up and run something so complex and important as a school. In addition, teaching, which the government sees as the most important engine raising attainment, was found to be "inadequate". "Many teachers are inexperienced and have not received the training and support they need," the Ofsted report said. This seems to highlight one of the most fundamental differences between free schools and regular state schools - there is no obligation to employ qualified teachers in England's free schools. The Department for Education argued that it gave free schools this freedom, which exists amongst independent schools, to enable them to employ industry experts. But this does not appear to have worked in the pupils' favour in the Al-Madinah case. The Ofsted report said: "Almost all teaching seen during the inspection, including in the Early Years Foundation Stage, was judged inadequate." It added that most teaching and lessons in the primary school were poorly planned and that teachers did not know how to use pupils' assessments to plan lessons and set work. Questions are now being asked about how the Department for Education could approve a school for opening one year, only for it to be found to lack the "basic systems" it needs to operate 12 months later. Were the checks necessary for ensuring the school would be fit for purpose undertaken in a sufficiently rigorous way? Judging from the pre-registration report undertaken by Ofsted in the July before it opened, no assessment was made by the inspectorate of the school's ability to educate pupils. But Ofsted did wave the red flag at this stage over child protection measures, saying that four regulations had not yet been met and that staff needed to undertake training on such issues. This was highlighted by shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt in an emergency question in the Commons. The DfE has insisted that it took all necessary steps to ensure the school was fit for purpose when it opened in September 2012. It said: "Ofsted recommended Al-Madinah should be registered as long as four requirements were met. "Ofsted often sets out a number of requirements it wants to see before new schools can open. In this case, [Al-Madinah Education Trust] provided the necessary evidence to show that these requirements were met." But the report also said the school had "not been adequately monitored or supported". Prime Minister David Cameron has taken to local radio to say that the school should close if it does not take immediate action to put things right. But he also said that this particular case should not be used as a "stick to beat the whole free school movement" as these were delivering a better standard of education than most state schools. He quoted figures hailed by the DfE earlier in the year which said three-quarters of the first free schools were rated good or outstanding - which a spokesman pointed out was a significantly higher proportion than all state schools. But Mr Hunt said the education of children in Derby was being sacrificed for ideology. He added: "It's not just the Al-Madinah School which is dysfunctional, it's the education secretary's free school policy." </body>

      <description>Stagnating social mobility warning - are the young paying the price?</description>

      <body>Alan Milburn says he was asked by the coalition to "hold its feet to the fire" in examining its progress on social mobility and child poverty. But just how much will his words hurt? In this, the first of what is planned to be an annual "State of the Nation report", the commission led by the former Labour health secretary concludes that "Britain remains a deeply divided country", one where "being born poor often leads to a lifetime of poverty". The commission says austerity has made it even harder to break ingrained cycles of poverty, that "disadvantage and advantage cascade down the generations". It warns there is a danger that social mobility will go in to reverse after rising in the middle of the last century and "flatlining" towards the end of it. The post-war years saw a big expansion of the middle classes, as the professional jobs market grew and more people bought their own homes, but there has been little change in the last quarter of the century. Mr Milburn said over decades, the UK had become a wealthier society, but had "struggled to become a fairer one" and had more children living in poverty and lower levels of social mobility than "many other developed nations". A total of 2.3 million children (one in six) live in poverty, he said, and this made it essential that the pattern where "birth not worth" determined a person's chances in life was changed. Higher social mobility had become "the new holy grail of public policy". It is certainly something all parties now say they want to see. The report from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission has stinging words on some areas of government policy but they are sweetened with praise for others, including the fact that the coalition continues to "stick to its commitments" on ending child poverty and improving social mobility in "challenging times". Mr Milburn told journalists at a news conference the government "deserved credit" for that. But the target of ending child poverty by 2020 - begun under Labour and continued by the coalition government - would "in all likelihood" be missed, he said. His most stinging criticism seemed to be about the way the young were likely to pay the highest price for a lack of social mobility and poverty during the global financial crisis. He called for older generations to be asked to dig deeper. The number of young people who have been unemployed for two years or more is at a "20-year high", he said. And there was an "inter-generational unfairness" in terms of who was being asked to pick up the bill in the recession. He did not call for pension cuts, but Mr Milburn said politicians should be prepared to "break political taboos" to talk about whether wealthier pensioners should lose benefits currently available to all - particularly the winter fuel allowance and the free TV licence. Pensioners were usually more worried about their grandchildren than themselves, he said. The commission is also looking to employers to do more - to offer better training, pay higher wages and open up professions to a wider pool of people. Two-thirds of children living in poverty, the report says, are living in homes with a working parent. Schools and universities were also urged to do more. He said schools in some areas were letting down pupils from poorer homes and those from middle-income homes too. Schools should give more help to low-achievers from middle-income homes as well as the poorest, while the government should improve careers advice, give extra incentives for teachers to teach in the worst schools and pay colleges "by results they achieve for their students in the labour market - not the numbers they recruit". As for universities - which were the focus of an earlier report by the commission - he says the sector as a whole has drawn in more students from poorer homes but top institutions remain out of reach for too many. Each year, he said, there were 3,700 "missing" state school pupils who had achieved the grades needed to get in to universities in the Russell Group (which represents some of the UK's leading universities) but did not go to them. The commission called for the government to put social mobility at the heart of its policies and practices, so that it was a "golden thread" running through all it did. It concentrated on the overall UK picture, but pointed out that in Scotland and Wales, the issue "currently has a low profile". In an age of austerity, the report's authors suggest creating a fairer society will be a job for all - and far from pain-free. </body>

      <description>Asia's 'tiger parents' paying a high price for children's future</description>

      <body>Zhang Yang, a bright 18-year old from a rural town in Anhui province in China was accepted to study at a prestigious traditional medicine college in Hefei. But the news was too much for his father Zhang Jiasheng. Zhang's father was partly paralysed after he suffered a stroke two years ago and could no longer work. He feared the family, already in debt to pay for medicines, would not be able to afford his son's tuition fees. As his son headed home to celebrate his success, Zhang Jiasheng killed himself by swallowing pesticide. Zhang's case is an extreme. But East Asian families are spending more and more of their money on securing their children the best possible education. In richer Asian countries such as South Korea and emerging countries like China, "education fever" is forcing families to make choices, sometimes dramatic ones, to afford the bills. There are families selling their apartments to raise the funds to send their children to study overseas. Andrew Kipnis, an anthropologist at Australian National University and author of a recent book on the intense desire for education in China, says the amount spent on education is "becoming extreme". It is not just middle-class families. Workers also want their children to do better than themselves and see education as the only means of ensuring social mobility. Some go deep into debt. "Families are spending less on other things. There are many cases of rural parents not buying healthcare that their doctors urge on them... Part of the reason is that they would rather spend the money on their children's education," said Mr Kipnis. "Parents may be forced to put off building a new house, which they might have been able to do otherwise," said Mr Kipnis who did the bulk of his research in Zouping district in Shandong province, among both middle-class and rural households. "It can be very intense. They often borrow from relatives. Of course some people have difficulty paying it back," said Mr Kipnis. A Euromonitor survey found that per capita annual disposable income in China rose by 63.3% in the five years to 2012, yet consumer expenditure on education rose by almost 94%. It's not just the parents' incomes. Educating a child has become an extended-family project. "It goes beyond tiger mothers, it also includes tiger grandmothers and grandfathers," said Todd Maurer, an expert on education in Asia and partner at the consultancy firm, Sinica Advisors. There is evidence of high levels of education spending in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Spending is also increasing in India and Indonesia. In South Korea, where the government believes "education obsession" is damaging society, family expenditure on education has helped push household debt to record levels. According to the LG Economic Research Institute, 28% of South Korean households cannot afford monthly loan repayments, and are hard pressed to live off their incomes. A huge proportion of that income - 70% of Korean household expenditure, according to estimates by the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul, goes toward private education, to get an educational edge over other families. Families cut back on other household spending "across the board," said Michael Seth, professor of Korean history at James Madison University in the US and author of a book on South Korea's education zeal. "There is less money to spend on other things like housing, retirement, or vacations." "Every developing country in Asia, specially China, seems to have a similar pattern," said Prof Seth. A highly competitive examination system and rising aspirations are often blamed. "The Korean education system puts enormous pressure on children," said Prof Seth." The only way to opt out of the system is not to have children. It is so expensive to educate a child that it is undoubtedly a factor in South Korea's very low birth rate," he said. The education obsession is so all consuming that the South Korean government has unsuccessfully tried to curb it, concerned about family spending on extra-curricular lessons and cram schools for ferociously competitive exams. While not yet at South Korean levels, China's education fever also puts pressure on family spending. A recent survey by market research company Mintel, found that nine out of 10 children from middle class families in China attended fee-charging after-school activities. Parents believe these activities will help their children when it comes to university entry. Children are being tutored for longer, starting younger. Where before it was for a year or two before the university entrance exam, now it can start in middle school or even primary. Matthew Crabbe, Asia research director at Mintel, says that people in China are using the savings that might have been put aside for healthcare. "But because the cost of education has risen and the competition for places at good universities have become so much more intense, they are investing more of their savings to make sure the child can get the grades they would need to get in." It does not stop there. Nearly 87% of Chinese parents said they were willing to fund study abroad. In the past an overseas education was confined to the most privileged. Now many more want foreign degrees to give them a shortcut to success. According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a third of Chinese students studying abroad in 2010 were from working-class families. This is a massive financial burden and parents may not realise the true costs. According to Zhang Jianbai who runs a private school in Yunnan province, parents in small provincial cities often sell their apartments to fund their children's study overseas. "Parents decide very early on that their children are going to go abroad and that requires quite a bit of money because [the preparation] cannot be acquired through the public education system," said Mr Maurer. It can include intensive English lessons, study tours to the US and significant payments for student recruitment agents. Last year an estimated 40,000 Chinese students travelled to Hong Kong to take the US college admissions exam, the Scholastic Assessment Test (SATS), which is not offered in mainland China. Chinese education company, New Oriental Education, organises SAT trips to Hong Kong for $1,000 (£627) on average, and parents spend up to $8,000 (£5,020) on tutoring. Once confined to affluent Beijing and Shanghai, it is an expanding market. The company expects its revenue to grow by over 40% in China's second and third tier cities. "Parents are surrendering their last resources to wager them on a child's future by sending them abroad," said Lao Kaisheng, an education policy researcher at Capital Normal University in Beijing. It means that when young people graduate there is great pressure on them to start earning. This is particularly an issue as record numbers of students graduate, seven million this year, and an overseas degree no longer has the status it had in the past. Many graduates languish in non-graduate jobs. But it is not easy to dampen education fever. In South Korea as in other East Asian countries, "it is deeply embedded in the culture. It's also based on reality that there is no alternative pathway to success or a good career other than a prestige degree, this was true 50 years ago, and it's just as true today". "As long as that's the case it's actually rational for parents to spend so much and put so much pressure on their children," said Prof Seth. </body>

      <body>A school in Bath is reported to have banned pupils from handing out birthday party invitations at school unless the entire class is on the guest list. Father-of-three Ben Milne explores the social minefield of children's parties. It's one of the big questions for parents of small children. Do you invite the whole class to little Harry or Sophie's party, or do you face the fall-out? What the head teacher of Kingswood Prep School in Bath has proposed isn't that revolutionary. At my children's primary school, for instance, the policy is for the child to give their teacher the invitations, which will then be placed discreetly in the invitees' school bags or trays. Nobody feels snubbed, and everybody's happy. What could possibly go wrong with this plan? Oh yes. Children. There you are, waiting for the hordes to arrive, furniture all re-arranged, and party food out on the table. Then your little darling realises they've got a school bag full of invites they've forgotten to give to the teacher. This actually happened to my nephew on his 10th birthday. He was remarkably sanguine about this (the unexpected windfall of unlimited Wotsits seemed to soften the blow somewhat). And if you do invite the whole class, what then? Do you really want your living room used to re-enact Battle Royale with party bags? Or if you want to keep the repair bill down, do you throw large sums of money at the local multiplex or five-a-side pitch? So it's time to whittle down the list. There's the Katie Hopkins method (exclude any child who doesn't share a name with a minor royal) or else there's a process of intense negotiation down from the 200 closest friends your child announces they want to invite, down to the manageable four you had in mind. But is it so bad not being invited to parties? Like a lot of not-very-nice, but survivable things in childhood - not being picked for the team, being blamed for something you didn't do - a snub isn't nice, but it's a small but valuable lesson for the hardships life one day throws at you. As Nietzsche (or was it Kelly Clarkson?) said, "What doesn't kill us, makes us stronger." I don't think he had kids' parties in mind, though.

      <title>From drug smuggler to going straight</title>
      <description>How ex-prisoner Frank went from drug smuggling to a 'stable life'</description>

      <body>As Ofsted inspectors deliver a critical verdict of the education prisoners receive in England's jails, one ex-inmate describes how he finally learnt a vital lesson. Expelled from school at 12, Frank Harris says it was the thought of how he would be remembered by his own children that helped him see education as a way to change his life. The 53-year-old Londoner says he was in and out of prisons for more than 30 years before he found his "way out" through education and wants other people involved in crime to see it is not too late for them either. "I wasn't getting any younger. I was thinking, 'What will my four kids do if I dropped down [dead]?' "If they said I was in and out of prison - that I wasted my time on earth. Now they can say I made mistakes, but I tried to do something different. That pushes me on. "I'm still enjoying my education and still have something to give back." Frank is in the second year of a degree in criminology and criminal justice. He counsels and mentors others who have been involved in crime and has worked with the police on tackling gang culture. But in 2004 he was facing his longest prison stretch ever - four years for smuggling cocaine from Amsterdam - after what he says was a "lifetime of crime". "I knew I'd be coming out, that I needed to do something, to make a change instead of hanging around with people," he said. "I found I enjoyed learning. I had been interested before in lots of things but never had the kind of environment for it to be cool to learn." In prison, he did basic skills lessons before getting A-grades in GCSE English and maths. "People saying well done, that inspired me to say I enjoyed doing this education and it was positive. I saw I could change my life, learning and achieving things. I saw education as a way out and that it could be the key to set me free." After leaving jail, Frank says he was very tempted to go back to his old way of life but instead decided to stay in touch with a charity that had supported him inside - the Prisoners' Education Trust - and the St Giles Trust. "Normally, I was getting picked up by one of my friends [when I got out of jail], and before I got back to London, I would be stoned and wouldn't get home for two days. "The crucial thing this time was there was link. This group had offices you can get in touch with when you get out." Frank says he was on the verge of getting involved with crime again when, he says: "Something told me, 'Don't take the left path, take a right,' and instead, I went down to the offices." He went on take a qualification in counselling to help homeless and vulnerable people and to work for the charity Turning Point. He now counsels others, he says, "to try to stop them taking my path". Like many people in Britain's jails, Frank did badly at school. He had no academic qualifications before studying in prison in his 40s. Expelled at 12, he says he was "delinquent" for 18 months, before being sent to a reform "boarding school", where he says there was no proper teaching. "The classroom was a work room and the teachers - who were really PE teachers - used to say, 'Finish that English off, then you can finish making your chair.' "Boys would be banging about while others were doing written work." Frank says things then went further downhill. "I'd come home every two weeks - my family would not know me, I had no friends. I'd go around by myself and began breaking in to cars, doing rubbish stuff because I was lonely, bored." Shortly after that, Frank says, he began to get custodial sentences for theft and fraud and "that was it for 30 years". He says he was never involved with violent or sexual crimes, but witnessed violence. "People were getting shot in a car next to me; people getting stabbed, but I never picked up a knife in anger. I was smoking crack but I always felt I was on the outside looking in; like I was not meant to be there. "Now I know that reason was to say to young men and women, 'You don't have to go that way - it's such a waste.' I'm here to tell that story. "If you find yourself on the that road, if you are in prison, there's a way out and it's education. "Now I'm a proper father, a proper son, a proper grandfather. I'm stable and I have a family that's stable." </body>

      <title>Corruption and bribery in the classroom</title>
      <description>Bribery and corruption in the classroom</description>

      <body>Corruption in education is a serious blight that undermines the quality and availability of schools and universities around the world, according to an international report. Anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International have published a global survey showing that about one in six students has had to pay a bribe for education services. In parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia this might be requiring parents to pay a fee for a school place that should be free. In Eastern Europe, it might be paying to gain an advantage in university admissions. The Berlin-based campaign group is best known for its annual "global corruption barometer", which measures levels of dishonest payments in more than 100 countries, based on more than 114,000 household interviews. This year's survey also asked questions about people's first-hand experiences and perceptions of dishonesty in education. In some countries these perceptions are distinctively negative. The report says that almost three-quarters of people in Cameroon and Russia see their education systems as "corrupt or highly corrupt". The findings show a huge range of malpractice. In Pakistan, there are warnings of thousands of "shadow schools" without any real students, but drawing public funding to pay for "ghost teachers". "Leakages" in the funding of schools in Kenya had the equivalent value of losing more than 11 million text books, says the report. A study of 180 schools in Tanzania showed that more than a third of intended funds had failed to reach the school. In Greece there are warnings about nepotism in jobs and promotions in higher education. In Vietnam there is a problem with bribery for places in the most sought-after schools. The report quotes figures from the United Nations showing 110 countries where fees are levied, despite in theory having free education enshrined in law. The report describes "myriad pretexts" to impose charges on parents. So why should education be so vulnerable to corruption? Parents want the best for their children, says the report, and they can be exploited by unscrupulous officials controlling access to places. It also involves a great deal of public money filtering down from central government to local school authorities. In Nigeria, the report says, $21m (£13m) intended for schools was lost in two years. But it's not only a problem for the developing world or those providing the basics of schooling. The massive expansion in demand for university education has created rich opportunities for illicit charges. Students need degree-level qualifications more than ever and are under great pressure to get university places and to leave with good grades, opening up fertile territory for corruption and cheating. Eastern European and former Soviet states are highlighted as having had particular difficulties. In Georgia, there have been reforms to stop corruption in university admissions. This hadn't simply been "cash-filled envelopes", but included a complex system of having to buy tutoring, Transparency International found. There could also be more practical types of illicit charges, with suggestions that in Romania access to university accommodation depended on bribery. The demand for qualifications has also generated its own industry in fake universities. In the United States, the report estimates, there are about a thousand "degree mills" in operation, selling bogus qualifications. This isn't only harmless self-delusion, says the report, as these bought qualifications are used to gain graduate jobs, including in one case working in a nuclear power plant. It also highlights the case of Colby Nolan, a student who ostensibly gained an MBA degree in 2004, until his owner revealed that the graduate was a six-year-old cat. He had gained the equivalent of an upper second class degree. The growth of higher education as a globalised, multi-billion dollar business has also spawned a parallel opportunity for fraud, says Philip Altbach, director of the Center for International Higher Education in the Lynch School of Education at Boston College. He has described the "spectre of corruption haunting" the move towards a more internationalised higher education system. And he has called for more co-ordinated international efforts to set standards and share information. The Transparency International study says that corruption has a corrosive effect on education, raising the cost and lowering the quality. "Many people wouldn't realise the extent of corruption in education, right through from the financing of education through to academic corruption," says report editor, Gareth Sweeney. "In some countries it's such a serious problem that it could undermine the credibility of their education systems." There is some good news as the report highlights efforts to tackle bribery. In Chile, anti-corruption lessons have been introduced to the school curriculum and in Bangladesh there is an "integrity pledge" taken by officials. The proliferation of mobile phones in Africa is being used to allow people to expose concerns about bribery in schools. Legal advice centres have also been developed in a number of countries to help community groups make legal challenges against school corruption. There are also international efforts to improve the monitoring and tracking of education funds. But corruption is still there leaching away education budgets. It's a particularly bleak problem when there are still tens of millions of children without any access to school. "Corruption is an obstacle to a fundamental human right to education," says Mr Sweeney. While there are campaigners calling for education for all, such as Malala Yousafzai in Pakistan, this report also warns of the barriers being created for the poorest communities by demands for corrupt payments. Teachers take bribes to offset poor wages or irregular payments and that in turn raises questions about the lack of funding coming from higher up the chain. Mr Sweeney says that there should be a way of measuring good governance in any future global education targets. "Even when formal school fees are abolished, many households are still being forced to pay informal fees. How is a family supposed to be able to afford these costs, when they cannot afford their daily meals?," says Pauline Rose, director of Unesco's Global Monitoring Report, which tracks progress towards primary education for all. "Until these hidden costs are eradicated, we will not be able to call education free, and universal primary education will continue to remain a distant goal for the poorest." </body>

      <title>University boss: Head teacher, mayor or chief executive?</title>
      <description>What does a university vice-chancellor do?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24462298</url>
      <date>1381370654</date>

      <body>Sir David Bell is vice-chancellor of the University of Reading. So what does he do all day? Does it make him a high-powered head teacher, responsible for the university's academic prowess? Or does it make him chief executive of a multi-million pound enterprise, plotting its future business strategy? Sitting in his office at the beginning of a new academic year, it's a reminder of how many big decisions are lying ahead of the UK's university leaders. On the most practical level, he says, it's like running a small town, with its own housing, doctors, libraries, nursery, shops, bars, sports facilities, hundreds of acres of parkland and campus security. There is an ambassadorial role of seeing and being seen. But it's easy to overlook how much universities have grown in terms of local economic significance. It's a long way from being an academic cottage industry. The vice-chancellor in many university towns is now the biggest local employer, apart from the NHS. There are 4,000 people directly employed by Reading University and many more depend on its spending power. The university and its staff and students are worth an estimated £1.78m every single day to the local economy. Universities like Reading were often set up with money from local big businesses - and now they've become the local big spenders themselves. Reading University is a member of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), as well as belonging to academic groups. Even after students finish their courses, the impact continues, with an estimated 19,000 of the university's graduates continuing to live and work in the area. There is an international dimension, as the UK's universities look to expand overseas, not least because of the need for a reliable source of extra income. Reading already has an outpost in South Africa and is planning to open a campus in Malaysia. They decided not to go ahead with plans for China. Sir David, a former Ofsted chief inspector, says the university needs to make plans to offset the volatility of relying on undergraduate student numbers. The word that Sir David uses to describe his responsibilities is "stewardship". The university is heading towards the 100th anniversary of its charter and as the current captain of the ship he wants to make sure it continues safely into the future. He says he "feels the weight" of this legacy and has the words of a previous vice-chancellor on his office wall: "Universities are living things - they feel, think and do." "There's a danger in being purely a chief executive. At the heart, it's about teaching and research," he says. He says he spends as much time as he can with the academics. In terms of running the organisation, there is the weekly equivalent of a cabinet meeting of senior staff. "You sometimes feel vulnerable, you're carrying financial risks. These are big decisions about opening campuses overseas. But you have to make the best decisions at the time with the information available." There is also a responsibility for 17,000 young lives. He says he has been meeting and greeting new arrivals at the university. Watching parents saying goodbye to their children has brought home to him the importance of this moment. "This is a big deal. We've got to look after them. It's often their first experience away from home." The funding of universities is increasingly dependent on attracting undergraduates and their tuition fees. And the unpredictability is a problem for long-term planning. "I can't imagine there's a vice-chancellor in the land who isn't thinking about it." It raises questions about how mainstream, provincial universities, with a tradition of doing a bit of everything, can make themselves distinctive. Not just compared with other UK universities but also international rivals. The emergence of online university courses - so-called Moocs - makes the powerhouses of US universities only a mouse click away. The uncertainty over undergraduate numbers has given universities an incentive to find other sources of income, such as shifting towards graduate courses and executive training. The Henley Business School, a slice of the City on the Reading campus, has its own mock trading rooms. Postgraduates are now 45% of the students on Reading's campus. But how should a modern university present itself? Is it meant to be clad in ivy or silicon? On a warm autumn afternoon, the Reading campus looks like something from an American college movie, with youngsters practising American football on leafy sports fields. It's a long way from roll-up cigarettes and Oxfam overcoats. There has been a surge of new university buildings to attract young students. In Reading they've put £400m into new accommodation. Sir David says universities have had to respond to "changing patterns of affluence and what young people expect". "I don't take too precious a view of that." But if universities spend too much, they can be accused of being cash rich. When earlier this year the university bought a unique Samuel Beckett manuscript to add to its archive there was some carping about the price tag of £962,500. A US university would have told everyone it cost twice as much and put it all over the website to show they were serious players. Sir David says that despite the upheavals in funding and technology and the push towards a more competitive system he expects more to stay the same than will change. "We're in turbulent times," he says, but remains confident that the university will still be recognisable in two decades. "There is something powerful in having great seats of learning." </body>

      <body>Microsoft has released the Windows 8.1 update for its flagship operating system. The download seeks to address some of the criticisms levelled at the original version of Windows 8. In particular, the update restores the start button and allows a computer to boot up with a traditional desktop interface. The launch comes at a critical time for Microsoft as it seeks a new boss, with PC sales experiencing a long decline. Windows 8 sought to bridge the gap between touchscreen devices, such as tablets and smartphones, and more traditional form laptops and desktop machines. As such it had an interface built of tiles that could be tapped or swiped to open applications. However, many people found the tiled interface did not work well for some of the things they were used to doing with a computer. The changes in 8.1 include: A host of other changes, including better support for multi-tasking and improved links to Microsoft's Xbox game console, are also in the update. Windows 8 was created to capitalise on the growing popularity of tablets and other portable gadgets. Microsoft needs to get people using its software on these machines because sales of desktop machines are in sharp decline. Global shipments of PCs hit a five-year low in early October, according to figures from market research firm Gartner. Sales of PCs had now fallen for six quarters in a row, it added. The downward trend in sales statistics were confirmed by IDC, which added that the decline would probably continue into 2014. The shrinking sales are important for Microsoft because traditionally the bulk of its revenue comes from people and companies buying laptops and desktops and office software to run on them. It is not clear that Microsoft is adjusting to the changes in the types of gadgets that people use. In July, Microsoft was wrote off $900m (£559m) following poor sales of its own-brand Surface touchscreen devices. At the same time, Microsoft has undergone a major reorganisation and has bought phone maker Nokia. It is also launching a new version of its Xbox games console and has begun searching for a new chief executive. Servers ready to dispense the update were turned on at 07:00 New York time (12:00 BST). The update is free to those already running Windows 8. Charges will apply if users upgrade to 8.1 from Windows 7. The update comes just over a year after the launch of Windows 8. </body>

      <title>Adidas smartwatch has pulse sensor</title>
      <description>Adidas announces a touchscreen colour watch that can measure its owner's heart-rate to create tailored training programmes.</description>

      <body>A watch with a colour touchscreen and built-in heart monitor that studies the wearer's pulse to create training programmes has been unveiled by Adidas. The gadget - which is being targeted at runners - also includes a GPS location chip to maximise the accuracy of its readings. It marks a move by the German firm into the smartwatch sector, although the device does not run third-party apps. The news comes the same week as rival Nike updated its own activity tracker. The two companies - which are best known for their sports clothing and shoe ranges - are taking different approaches with their flagship products. At $399 (£350 in the UK) Adidas's Micoach Smart Run is more than double the price of Nike's $149 Fuelband SE. But it offers a wider range of sensors as well as the ability to play MP3 audio files to wireless headphones via Bluetooth. It also has the advantage of offering partner apps for Android, Windows Phone and iOS devices. By contrast, Nike only offers a Fuelband app for the iPhone. The US firm does, however, offer a separate Nike-branded watch made by the Dutch firm TomTom that features a GPS chip and can be paired with a heart rate strap made by another company. Adidas announced its new product at Gigaom's Mobilize conference in San Francisco. It said athletes could use the watch to create a coaching programme to improve their fitness levels and would then receive feedback via animated graphics on its screen, vibrations, and audio commands - using paired headphones - telling them to speed up or slow down. The new device is bigger than less advanced digital watches and screenless activity trackers also sold by Adidas, but its 1.45in (3.7cm) display is smaller than the screens on Samsung and Sony's new smartwatches. The Galaxy Gear and Smartwatch 2 both offer a range of activity apps of their own as well as other Android software, but rely on being paired with a smartphone for much of their functionality. Adidas says its product's battery lasts about 14 days when its tracking sensors are switched off. However, that drops to just four hours when it is switched into "training mode". Motorola's Motoactv watch may be its closest competitor. The gadget also features a GPS chip and MP3 player, but not a pulse rate sensor of its own. Consultancy Juniper Research recently predicted the wider wearable tech market will grow from $1.4bn of sales this year to $19bn by 2018. However, it suggested that sales of specialist fitness tracking equipment and watches that are, in effect, slaves to smartphones will be cannibalised by more powerful standalone devices. "The products currently available in the market only appeal to a niche demographic, but as we move towards the age of a true multifunctional smartwatch we expect them to become more appealing," said its senior analyst Nitin Bhas. "We believe players like Apple, Google and Microsoft will release devices that can acts as a fitness tracker, as a digital wallet, as a way of offering ticketing and coupons, and all sorts of other things. To be honest, the market is still waiting for a killer app. "There is an opportunity for Adidas here - but along with start-ups entering the wearable tech sector, it has a very narrow window and is likely to struggle as the marketplace becomes increasingly crowded." Adidas said it would start selling the new watch next month. </body>

      <title>EE rapped over 'misleading' maps</title>
      <description>The Advertising Standards Authority asks for changes to EE's mobile coverage checker following a complaint about its accuracy.</description>

      <body>The Advertising Standards Authority has ordered EE to change its mobile coverage checker after a customer complained it had wrongly told him he would receive excellent service in his area. The checker must make it clearer that it is only a guide, the ASA said. The decision is likely to have an impact on other mobile operators offering similar maps. Mobile coverage can vary widely from street to street. It depends on a variety of factors, including the density of buildings and the number of trees in the area. Despite the fact that the EE coverage map has an addendum which states that it is "only a guide and not guarantee of service availability in a particular location", the ASA still felt the ad was misleading Its ruling stated: "We noted that the claims under the coverage results were presented in language that was not conditional and consider the overall impression of the ad was such that it was likely to be understood to mean that fast reliable internet access and high quality calling was available... to consumers in the relevant postcode." In response EE said: "Our coverage checker is regulated by Ofcom and offers a prediction of our network coverage across the UK. In this instance, we deemed coverage to be Excellent in the postcode as confirmed by testing that found over 98% of the postcode had an excellent signal." "We take on board the ASA's ruling and will amend the disclaimer language as necessary," it added. EE customers are given a 14-day cooling off period if they are not happy with the mobile service after signing a new contract. O2 also points out that customers have a seven-day window to cancel their service if they find it is not as good as expected. "Our coverage maps are created on accurate predictions of the network, but unfortunately they can't always take into account a number of factors affecting signal like building structures and natural landscape," the mobile firm said in a statement. "We're making daily improvements to our network and our coverage maps for 2G, 3G and 4G are updated to reflect these on a weekly basis." Most operators have ambitious plans for 4G coverage, both indoors and outdoors, with most planning to reach around 98% of the population by 2017. But it is notoriously hard to produce accurate mobile coverage maps. All the operators produce their own and use different metrics for measuring coverage. Some have called on Ofcom to produce its own coverage map, something that the regulator has rejected. There are a few independent coverage maps available from firms such as RootMetrics and OpenSignal. Matthew Howett, analyst with research firm Ovum said: "While the operator's own coverage checkers are usually very accurate, they don't all necessarily measure the same thing. For instance some might only be for outdoor coverage, whereas others will also give you an idea what you can expect indoors. "Given these peculiarities, they are useful only up to a point for consumers when making comparisons between networks," he added. </body>

      <description>Oracle has released a bumper update package for Java that closes lots 51 separate security holes in the software.</description>

      <body>Oracle has released a bumper update package for Java that closes lots of security holes in the software. The update fixes 51 separate security bugs in Java, which owner Oracle says is used on billions of devices. About a dozen of the bugs were serious enough to allow attackers to take remote control of a compromised system, researchers said. Java is one of the most popular targets for cyber-thieves and malware writers seeking to hijack home computers. In its advisory about the update, Oracle urged customers to patch the software as soon as possible "due to the threat posed by a successful attack". Programming language Java has proved popular because software written with it can easily be made to run on many different types of computer. Twelve of the holes in Java addressed by the update topped the table that ranked the severity of security weaknesses in software, wrote Qualys security expert Wolfgang Kandek in a blogpost. If these bugs were exploited, attackers could bypass ID controls and take over a target system, he added. He said those seeking to exploit Java would probably seed web pages with booby-trapped links in a bid to catch vulnerable machines. Security glitches in Java are favourites among those that write and run so-called "exploit kits" that seek to compromise vulnerable websites and other systems. Security blogger Brian Krebs said if people needed to run Java, it was well worth taking time to apply the update. Those that did not need the software should consider disabling it altogether, he said. "This widely installed and powerful program is riddled with security holes, and is a top target of malware writers and miscreants," he wrote. The update is available via the main Java website and has prompted follow-up action from other electronics firms. Apple has released an update to the version of Java that runs on its computers. This update points people towards the official version of Java from Oracle instead of that supplied by Apple. In the past, Apple has faced criticism over the speed with which it updated its version of Java. </body>

      <title>Watch Dogs delay wounds games maker</title>
      <description>More than a quarter of Ubisoft's market value is wiped out after the French video games publisher delays the launch of hacker-themed title Watch Dogs.</description>

      <body>Shares in video games firm Ubisoft have slumped by 26% after it delayed the release of two much-anticipated titles. Hacker-themed Watch Dogs and open-world racing game The Crew have both been postponed until the publisher's next financial year, which begins in April. The company said it wanted to allow its developers to fine tune their work. Watch Dogs had been due to go on sale on 19 November and will miss out on being a launch title for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Retailers, including Amazon and Gamestop, have assured consumers who had pre-ordered bundles including both the Chicago-based title and one of the games consoles that they will still receive the machine on the day they had been quoted. The Crew had originally been due out some time in the first three months of 2014. France-based Ubisoft has had success with its Assassin's Creed, Just Dance and Splinter Cell franchises. However, it warned that the delays meant it was likely to swing to an operating loss when it declares its full-year results. Chief executive Yves Guillemo called the move a "tough decision". "We are building franchises that will become perennial pillars of Ubisoft's financial performance," he added. "In a context of growing successes for mega-blockbusters, the additional time given to the development of our titles will allow them to fulfil their huge ambitions and thus offer players even more exceptional experiences." A blog posted by the Watch Dogs development team added that it planned to launch the game before the end of June. "As we got closer to release, as all the pieces of the puzzle were falling into place in our last push before completion, it became clear to us that we needed to take the extra time to polish and fine tune each detail so we can deliver a truly memorable and exceptional experience," it stated. Ubisoft added that The Crew would now go on sale before the end of September. The news caught many analysts by surprise. To make its November debut, the "gold master" version of Watch Dogs' code would have needed to have been finalised soon in order for the discs to be manufactured and shipped to stores in time. It is unusual, though not unknown, for a game to be pulled so late in development. In February, Ubisoft delayed its platformer Rayman Legends by half a year, less than a month before it had been due to go on sale. Perhaps the best known example was Valve's announcement in 2003 that its sci-fi action sequel Half-Life 2 was to be delayed, just a week before its scheduled launch date. It went on to become one of the best reviewed games of all time. One industry watcher said a short-term view by investors had caused the firm's stock to dive, but that Ubisoft was better off doing this than releasing Watch Dogs in a state that required later software patches to address major faults. "I think it was going to be one of the drivers for initial games-console bundle sales and will probably push back some of the hardware sales that would have happened right out of the gate for Sony and Microsoft," said Lewis Ward, video games research manager at consultants IDC. "But absolutely it's the right decision if there's something glitchy or there's some game-balance factor that is off. "There's a lot of interconnections between the things you can control in the game and how the story then unfolds, so I can only assume there's some factor with the incredibly complex open-world gameplay that's off. "But there's no reason Ubisoft can't still deliver what they hoped to do with this game." </body>

      <title>Samsung offers to end patent wars</title>
      <description>To avoid a huge fine for allegations that it has abused the patent system, Samsung has waved the white flag on patent wars.</description>

      <body>Samsung has said that it will stop taking rivals to court over certain patent infringements for the next five years. The white flag in the patent battle has been raised because the South Korean electronics firm faces a huge fine for alleged abuses of the system. The move could help end a long-running patent war between the world's largest mobile operators. The EU said that a resolution would bring "clarity to the industry". "Samsung has offered to abstain from seeking injunctions for mobile SEPs (standard essential patents) for a period of five years against any company that agrees to a particular licensing framework," the European Commission said in a statement. Standard essential patents refer to inventions recognised as being critical to implementing an industry standard technology. Examples of such technologies include the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), a cellular standard at the heart of 3G data; and H.264, a video compression format used by YouTube, Blu-ray disks and Adobe Flash Player among others. The EU had accused the Samsung of stifling competition by bringing a series of SEP lawsuits against Apple and other rivals. Google's Motorola Mobility has been charged with similar anti-competitive practice. Samsung faced a $18.3bn (£11.3bn) fine if it was found guilty of breaching anti-trust laws. "Enforcing patents through injunctions can be perfectly legitimate, said Joaquin Almunia, the European Commission's vice-president in charge of competition policy. "However, when patents are standard-essential, abuses must be prevented so that standard-setting works properly and consumers do not have to suffer negative consequences from the so-called patent wars. "If we reach a good solution in this case, it will bring clarity to the industry," he added. Samsung and Apple are currently battling each other in courts in more than 10 countries across Europe. Interested parties have been given a month to comment on the proposals. </body>

      <title>Underwater wi-fi given test run</title>
      <description>A team from Buffalo, New York, has been testing "underwater wi-fi" as it attempts to create an internet for the oceans.</description>

      <body>Researchers have tested an "underwater wi-fi" network in a lake in an attempt to make a "deep-sea internet". The team, from the University of Buffalo, New York, said the technology could help detect tsunamis, offering more reliable warning systems. They aim to create an agreed standard for underwater communications, to make interaction and data-sharing easier. Unlike normal wi-fi, which uses radio waves, the submerged network technology utilises sound waves. Radio waves are able to penetrate water, but with severely limited range and stability. Sound waves provide a better option - as demonstrated by many aquatic species such as whales and dolphins. Wireless communication underwater has been possible for some time, but the problem lies in getting separate systems used by different organisations to communicate with each other. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), for instance, uses acoustic waves to send data from tsunami sensors on the sea floor to buoys on the surface. However due to infrastructure differences, this data cannot be shared quickly with other information gathered by the US Navy. Therefore, the University of Buffalo team is attempting to create a shared standard. "A submerged wireless network will give us an unprecedented ability to collect and analyse data from our oceans in real time," said Tommaso Melodia, lead researcher. "Making this information available to anyone with a smartphone or computer, especially when a tsunami or other type of disaster occurs, could help save lives." The test was carried out at Lake Erie, near Buffalo. The research team dropped two 40lb (18kg) sensors into the water - and were then able to use a laptop to transmit information to them. In future, the team hopes the sensors could be used to help detect and solve environmental issues. With a shared standard, different research groups with varied equipment could potentially combine their data gathering efforts with greater ease, and in real-time. More details of the team's work will be presented at a conference for underwater networking to be held in Taiwan next month. </body>

      <title>Dexter malware strikes South Africa</title>
      <description>Malware designed to steal information from payment cards' magnetic strips strikes thousands of restaurants and retailers in South Africa.</description>

      <body>South Africa has been hit by one of the biggest cyber-fraud attacks in its history, according to the body that oversees local financial transactions. The payment card systems of thousands of shops, restaurants and hotels had been compromised, said the Payment Association of South Africa (Pasa). Losses were thought to be in the "tens of millions, but not hundreds of millions of rands", it said. It added the attackers had used a new variant of the malware known as Dexter. Ten million rand is worth £626,000 or just over $1m. Dexter gets its name from a string of code found in one of its files, which may refer to the US television show that followed the exploits of a serial killer. The Dexter code was linked to a series of attacks on point-of-sale systems in the UK, US and dozens of other countries towards the end of last year. It skims and transmits the cards' magnetic-strip information, allowing clones to be made that can then be used for fraudulent purchases,. Pasa said it believed the criminals responsible were based in Europe, but added it was not sure from which countries. "It's probably the worst [attack] of its kind in terms of the losses," Walter Volker, Pasa's chief executive, told the BBC. "We started detecting higher levels of fraud at some of these retailers early in the year - from about late-January, February. We initially thought it was a normal seasonal thing, but as the volumes increased we decided to appoint a forensics investigation company. "Eventually it was able to find this particular malware in some of the locations. Very soon after we found the cause of the compromise, we were able to clean up those sites with anti-malware software." Mr Volker added that while the attack had targeted back-end systems to steal data from the cards' magstrips, it had not stolen Pin codes or CVV payment authentication numbers - meaning the thieves would not have been able to withdraw money from bank cash machines or have used the information to make purchases from internet shops. "Normal anti-virus software would probably have cleaned up Dexter but it was a particular custom-built variant, which was not detectable with the normal scanning software that everybody's got," Mr Volker added. "It seems like it was a European-based syndicate - we don't exactly where - but Interpol and Europol are making good progress in trying to apprehend these particular perpetrators." KFC fast-food restaurants' card systems were among those to have been compromised, according to a statement given by the chain's owner to the Bloomberg news agency. "We take this extremely seriously," Yum Brands said. "Our first priority is to make sure that the impact on our customers remains minimal." Bloomberg added that a locally based burger and pizza chain operator, Famous Brands, had also confirmed some of its payment machines had been exposed. However, Pasa stressed that it would ultimately be the banks - rather than the public or other businesses - that would face losses as a consequence of the attack. "In terms of the banks, there's probably not a single issuing bank in the country that has not been affected in some way," said Mr Volker. "The South African card holders - or potentially tourists using their cards at the affected sites - will not be exposed to any losses. It's just the inconvenience of detecting false transactions on their accounts. "If that has happened they should just contact their issuing bank." </body>

Blaming slowing growth in online shopping rates in the US, the firm said it expected sales of between $4.5bn (£2.8bn) and $4.6bn for the holiday period. Shares in the company fell as much as 5% on the news in extended US trading. The quarter is a key shopping period for the firm. Ebay says it has seen weaker economic conditions in the United States. "US e-commerce softened considerably and we have a cautious outlook for the holiday season," Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan told investors on a conference call. Ebay reported net income for the third quarter of $689m, up 15% on the same period last year. Sales rose 14% to $3.89bn, helped by growth in mobile trading on the eBay auction site. </body>

      <title>Snapchat hack secretly saves images</title>
      <description>An app that discreetly saves images and videos sent through "self-destruct" messaging service Snapchat has been created, raising privacy fears.</description>

      <body>An app that discreetly saves images and videos sent through "self-destruct" messaging service Snapchat has been created. Snapchat rose to popularity as an app that allows people to share pictures, safe in the knowledge they would delete themselves after being viewed. However, Snaphack circumvents this system, allowing recipients to pass on or upload images to social media. Snapchat could not be reached for comment on the app. However, the company's terms of service state that it does not allow the development of "any third-party applications that interact with user content or the services without our prior written consent". Snaphack was made by UK-based developer Darren Jones, who told the BBC: "Snapchat has not been in touch and I imagine it's only a matter of time until they request that my app is removed. "But my app just proves and informs people that these apps exist and people need to be careful." Previous methods of saving or retrieving Snapchat images and video have been publicised. In August, another app known as Snap Save was distributed - but users found that if they saved an image it would inform the sender they had done so. Snaphack gives no such warning. The app is available through Apple's App Store. Apple is yet to comment on the issue. Although it is not marketed as such by the company, Snapchat has gained a reputation as a system for so-called "sexting", due to the app's countdown timer that renders the picture inaccessible after a few seconds. First released in 2011, the app has rapidly grown to be worth - according to one estimate - around $860m (£540m), but like many social media start-ups it has yet to turn a profit. Concerns over privacy have followed the app's success closely. In May, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) filed a complaint with the US Federal Trade Commission. "Snapchat is the app that promises to delete photos but it doesn't," said Marc Rotenberg, EPIC's executive director. "We have no problem with apps that make photos vanish. But they should work as promised, and if they don't the Federal Trade Commission should investigate." In response, Snapchat brushed off the claims - acknowledging that an image could easily be saved by simply taking a screenshot on the phone, or by photographing the screen with another device. Since then the company has regularly used its blog to outline its practices for storing images. Other image retrieval methods relied on special software to reverse-engineer Snapchat's system - but Snaphack's simplicity and automation raised serious issues, argued one expert. "It absolutely undermines the security of Snapchat," said Rik Ferguson, vice president of security research at Trend Micro. "If the fact that your photo has a limited lifetime is the one thing that gives you the comfort to send it, this news should put you off." Developer Mr Jones told the BBC he was introduced to Snapchat just three weeks ago - and said he designed the app to raise awareness that such sharing is possible. "For months people have been sending private images without knowing it has been possible to do this kind of thing with them with other apps," he told the BBC. "The ideal response from Snapchat will be to put a system in place to stop people being able to save images in this way or any other." Mr Ferguson added: "Snapchat advertises its service as being in the moment - but really the best advice is not to get lost in the moment. "Please, every single time, take a deep breath, and don't press that button." Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC. </body>

      <title>Nike shows off new Fuelband</title>
      <description>Nike unveils a new wrist-worn activity tracker, which attempts to address criticism that the earlier model did not distinguish between different activities.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24538852</url>

      <body>Nike has unveiled its second generation activity-tracking wristband, addressing criticism that its earlier device failed to recognise that some activities use more energy than others. The Fuelband SE lets owners define the start and end of a session and then tag it - for example as yoga or basketball. The firm's software then adjusts its "fuel" score accordingly. However, speculation that Nike would add a heart monitor or other new sensor to improve accuracy proved incorrect. The New York launch came a fortnight after the Fitbit Force was unveiled - a rival activity tracker that includes a height-measuring altimeter that can record how many stairs its owner has climbed. Jawbone, iHealth, Garmin, Withings and Adidas are among other firms to offer dedicated fitness-measuring gadgets. Meanwhile Samsung and Sony are promoting their newly released smartwatches' ability to download and run Android-based activity-tracking apps. One market watcher suggested Nike might have missed a trick. "Since Nike launched the first Fuelband early last year there has been an explosion of fitness wearables and apps," said Nitin Bhas, senior analyst at the tech consultancy Juniper Research. "On the one hand you have Apple's promotion of the new motion processor in its iPhone 5S, which extends battery life when the function is used, and on the other hand you have Fitbit adding new technology. "But you mustn't forget that Nike has the fact that it's an established brand in its favour, unlike some of the other firms involved." Other improvements to the Fuelband include an upgrade to the lower-power Bluetooth 4.0 technology, allowing the device to automatically synchronise its data to an iPhone rather than requiring the owner to carry out a series of button presses. There continues to be no official Fuelband app for Android devices, although users can connect the gadget to a computer to upload their data to a website. The firm also suggested a redesigned internal circuit board and other changes meant the device offered "greater flexibility" and "improved water resistance". Issues with the original model meant several users suffered error messages after several months' use, requiring the bracelet to be replaced. Like its predecessor, the company suggests the Fuelband SE can be worn in the shower but should not be submerged for extended periods, for example while swimming. The company said that its iOS app also introduced a feature allowing users to work together to hit a fuel score target as well as a way to better monitor how much energy was used at different hours of the day. Nike also announced plans to expand an existing programme to encourage third-party firms to develop software that makes use of the information generated by the device. Analysts agree that the wearable tech market - which includes devices such as Google's forthcoming Glass eyewear - is set to expand, but differ over its expected size. According to a new report from Juniper Research the sector will grow from $1.4bn (£878m) of annual sales this year to $19bn (£11.9bn) by 2018. Analysts at the bank Credit Suisse are more optimistic suggesting a $50bn figure by the same date. Tech research firm Gartner is more cautious suggesting a $10bn target for 2016. But one of its analysts suggested the sector would grow more quickly if businesses decided to equip their workers with such tech. "If you don't have motivated and passionate employees they don't give you the extra discretionary effort, and there's some thinking that wellness programmes that encourage staff to be healthier may make them more productive and combat absenteeism," Mike Gotta told the BBC. "But that raises the issue of privacy - where does the data go? Employees will be concerned if the information gathered could be used in a punitive way." Nike is adding France, Germany and Japan to its existing Fuelband markets - the US, Canada and the UK. It will be available from 6 November. </body>

      <title>3D printing 'entering the metal age'</title>
      <description>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion reactors.</description>

      <body>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion projects. The Amaze project brings together 28 institutions to develop new metal components which are lighter, stronger and cheaper than conventional parts. Additive manufacturing (or "3D printing") has already revolutionised the design of plastic products. Printing metal parts for rockets and planes would cut waste and save money. The layered method of assembly also allows intricate designs - geometries which are impossible to achieve with conventional metal casting. Parts for cars and satellites can be optimised to be lighter and - simultaneously - incredibly robust. Tungsten alloy components that can withstand temperatures of 3,000C were unveiled at Amaze's launch on Tuesday at London's Science Museum. At such extreme temperatures they can survive inside nuclear fusion reactors and on the nozzles of rockets. "We want to build the best quality metal products ever made. Objects you can't possibly manufacture any other way," said David Jarvis, Esa's head of new materials and energy research. "To build a [fusion reactor], like Iter, you somehow have to take the heat of the Sun and put it in a metal box. "3,000C is as hot as you can imagine for engineering. "If we can get 3D metal printing to work, we are well on the way to commercial nuclear fusion." Additive manufacturing with metal is not new; General Electric, for example, has used the technique to make fuel injectors for one of its aircraft engines. China claims to be using 3D printing to manufacture load-bearing components in aircraft. And in July, Nasa announced that it had successfully tested a 3D-printed rocket engine part. Amaze is a loose acronym for Additive Manufacturing Aiming Towards Zero Waste and Efficient Production of High-Tech Metal Products. The 20m-euro project brings together 28 partners from European industry and academia - including Airbus, Astrium, Norsk Titanium, Cranfield University, EADS, and the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. Factory sites are being set up in France, Germany, Italy, Norway and the UK to develop the industrial supply chain. Amaze researchers have already begun printing metal jet engine parts and aeroplane wing sections up to 2m in size. These high-strength components are typically built from expensive, exotic metals such as titanium, tantalum and vanadium. Using traditional techniques to fashion metal objects often wastes precious raw material. Whereas additive manufacturing - building parts up layer-on-layer from 3D digital data - has the potential to produce almost "zero waste". "To produce one kilo of metal, you use one kilo of metal - not 20 kilos," says Esa's Franco Ongaro. "We need to clean up our act - the space industry needs to be more green. And this technique will help us." Printing objects as a single piece - without welding or bolting - can make them both stronger and lighter. A weight reduction of even 1kg for a long-range aircraft will save hundreds of thousands of dollars over its lifespan. "Our ultimate aim is to print a satellite in a single piece. One chunk of metal, that doesn't need to be welded or bolted," said Jarvis. "To do that would save 50% of the costs - millions of euros." But Jarvis is candid about the problems and inefficiencies that still need to be overcome - what he calls the "dirty secrets" of 3D printing. "One common problem is porosity - small air bubbles in the product. Rough surface finishing is an issue too," he said. "We need to understand these defects and eliminate them - if we want to achieve industrial quality. "And we need to make the process repeatable - scale it up. "We can't do all this unless we collaborate between industries - space, fusion, aeronautics. "We need all these teams working together and sharing." </body>

      <title>Flossie the computer to be rebooted</title>
      <description>The National Museum of Computing announces plans to resurrect one of the oldest business computers still in existence.</description>

      <body>Efforts to reboot one of the oldest surviving mass-produced computers are under way in Milton Keynes. The National Museum of Computing has taken delivery of what it believes is the last ICT 1301 computer to ever have a chance of working again. The machine - known as Flossie - had originally been used to produce exam results for students at the University of London. The museum hopes to put it on display by 2016. One of its trustees said Flossie was one of the first computers specifically designed for use by UK businesses rather than scientific institutions. "Before this time, computers were absolutely huge with valves and thousands of vacuum tubes and would get incredibly hot, making them difficult to house in a normal business," Kevin Murrell, a trustee of the museum, told the BBC. "But this machine used transistors, which used very little power. That meant you could have more of them in the same space, you didn't need the complex cooling equipment and you wouldn't require the high power that earlier computers needed." ICT 1301s had a footprint of about 6m by 7m (20ft by 23ft) and weighed some five tonnes. They came with a punch card reader and printer built in to their body, which were used to enter and save data by means of creating a series of holes in a piece of stiff paper. "For medium-sized companies that wanted to computerise their invoicing, their accounting or their payroll, this gave them the help to do that," added Mr Murrell. The University of London bought its machine in the 1960s and used it for accounting and administration tasks in addition to generating GCE examination results for students in England and Wales. It was later sold at scrap metal value to a group of students before eventually ending up at a farm in Kent, whose owner donated the machine to the museum. Other editions of the machine were later used as props thanks to their arresting design. Doctor Who, the Pink Panther and the James Bond movie The Man with the Golden Gun all featured ICT 1301s. Over the years more than 150 computers were created, but the charity said it was only aware of three others being left in existence, all of which are beyond repair. "One of the problems with computers as museum artefacts is that when they are switched off they are fairly boring - it's fairly difficult to learn anything from them," explained Mr Murrell. "So ideally we want it switched on, and once we've restored it we will be able to run the original software. "We will have caused some damage in the move, so we need to deal with that, but I think in about three years' time we will have a properly demonstrable machine." </body>

The director of Europol, Rob Wainwright, has told the BBC that along with online drug selling, the internet has become "a primary facilitator of the international drug trafficking business". His comments follow a cyber-attack on the Belgian port of Antwerp, in which drugs traffickers are alleged to have recruited hackers to breach IT systems which controlled the movement and location of containers. Prosecutors say the cyber-attack allowed them to steal entire containers in which cocaine and heroin had been hidden.

      <title>Silk Road: Will cybercrime evolve?</title>
      <description>Is society safer after the illegal marketplace's demise?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24526677</url>
      <date>1381970464</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70475000/jpg/_70475097_hood.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Silk Road, the infamous online marketplace for drugs and other illegal goods, was closed down by the FBI earlier this month. Since then its alleged founder, Ross Ulbricht - who denies being the site's operator known as Dread Pirate Roberts - has been taken into custody, and police forces around the world have been making arrests. It is a blow to the sale and distribution of harmful substances, including cocaine and heroin, as well as disrupting other criminal activities arranged online, such as the sale of weapons and hitmen for hire. But for how long will society have been made safer? Does it mean the end for illegal marketplaces hidden in the so-called "deep web", which depend on the anonymity provided by the Tor network and the Bitcoin digital currency to attract buyers and sellers? Or is it little more than a minor inconvenience? One man with first-hand experience of FBI takedowns is Emmanuel Gadaix. He was one of the directors of Megaupload, the popular file-sharing website founded by Kim Dotcom that was closed down by the US Department of Justice in January 2012. "This changes nothing in the same way that the closure of Megaupload changed nothing," he says. "All that happens if you bust him [Dread Pirate Roberts] is that two new people come along. "The closure of Silk Road is no more the end of online narcotics sales as the arrest of Al Capone was the end of organised crime." Another man with similar experience is a twenty-something expat Irishman who calls himself H2.0. He is the ex-spokesman for a deep web drugs marketplace called Atlantis, which was closed down by its operators shortly before the Silk Road takedown for "security reasons". Criminals may be more than willing to prey on others, but when it comes to their own dealings they want to feel safe, and H2.0 says Silk Road had managed to build a strong brand in the underworld. "It was a pillar of trust in an otherwise Wild West of dodgy scamsites," he says. But he is sure an alternative to Silk Road will emerge. "We could be in for a period of sites popping up for a few months and closing [just] as fast. Silk Road will be replaced fast but the trust will take longer." Other marketplaces for illegal goods still exist in the deep web - Sheep and Black Market Reloaded (BMR) are two of the better-known ones - and it appears that former Silk Road sellers are already setting up shop in them. "I do know one vendor who was previously one of the top-selling vendors on Atlantis," H2.0 adds. "He moved to Silk Road as soon as Atlantis closed, and two weeks after Silk Road closed he is already set up on Sheep and BMR. "Vendors even seem confident enough to carry forward the same usernames and reputations from Silk Road, which shows they don't seem too worried about being tracked." But security expert Brian Krebs thinks the takedown is significant. "It once again dispels the myth of anonymity on the web, or in this case on the deep web," he suggests. "That's a big deal because clearly many buyers and sellers in this community were under the impression that their actions somehow could not be traced online." In the future, illegal deep web marketplaces are likely to attempt to reassure drug dealers and their customers that their communications with each other are secure by making it easy to encrypt conversations. It turns out that a software package called BitWasp that aims to provide this is already under development, and as an open source project will be available free to anyone who wants it. The man behind BitWasp is known in internet circles as afk11. He currently spends between 30 and 50 hours a week developing it, he tells the BBC. He describes himself as unemployed, 21 years old and from Ireland. Afk11 claims his motivation is to help promote the virtual currency Bitcoin, suggesting it could become a popular way to pay for concert tickets and other events. "Just because people want to remain private doesn't mean things are suspicious," he says. But does he believe that drugs marketplace operators will also use his software? "The short answer would be yes, they probably will," afk11 says. "We're not specifically gearing our project towards the 'dark web' although it will certainly have features which are popular on it, such as PGP encryption. "But it's more important to us that Bitcoin becomes adopted by the masses." The next generation of illegal marketplace operators will be much harder for the FBI or other law enforcement agencies to catch, according to a Bangkok-based security expert and broker of security exploits known as the Grugq. "You can be famous, or a criminal, but you can't be a famous criminal," he says. "[Dread Pirate Roberts] was advertising everywhere and attracting attention - which is never a good thing." He says that the new marketplaces will last longer because the operators won't make the same mistakes. "Each bust works as evolutionary pressure, selecting out the insecure sites and training the other ones what to do better, so there will be better and better services (for buyers and sellers) with each iteration of these marketplaces after each bust," he says. Mr Krebs concurs: "Denizens of these communities will learn from their mistakes... with the result that the up-and-coming communities probably will be more difficult to penetrate and take down." But the Grugq believes that despite the protection and anonymity that Tor, Bitcoin and encryption can provide, many marketplaces and their users will get caught thanks to old-fashioned police techniques. "What you will see with these sites is that as they become higher-profile, undercover agents will infiltrate them as vendors or customers," he says. "They may even work their way into the inner circle and become administrators working for the site." One thing the Silk Road takedown has done is show that operators of illegal marketplaces can and do get caught. And ultimately it's the fear of that happening that may put many people off embarking on a criminal career in the deep web. "I think a legit career move is best for me," H2.0 concludes. "Whoever wants to be the next Dread Pirate Roberts better be able to handle the stress. I didn't like it." </body>

      <title>Nike and the battle for your wrist</title>
      <description>Can fitness trackers change your behaviour?</description>

      <body>Nike says its new activity-tracking Fuelband SE will motivate people to exercise even more. But can a wristband really lead to better health? Back in 2009, Nike vice-president of digital sport Stefan Olander and his team had an idea: what if a person could track how much they've moved in a day, just by glancing at their wrist? And so, the Nike Fuelband was born. Released in 2012, in a simple, sleek, black plastic design that flashed from red to green once a person's daily fitness goal had been met, the first Fuelband sold out in hours. The pitch was this: by wearing a Fuelband and monitoring fitness data via an app or on the web, anyone - from a professional athlete to Mr Olander himself - could work out a better, more effective, path to health. "In today's society, we are overwhelmed with complexity," says Mr Olander. With the Fuelband, he says, Nike really tries "to filter out what doesn't matter and just give you what you need in order to stay motivated." So what's different this time around? Nike says that in addition to making physical improvements to the latest Fuelband - better waterproofing, stainless steel screws - it has also analysed the data from the first wave of Fuelband adopters to see ways in which the band and its supporting iOS app and website could be improved. They found that 98% of their 20 million users exercised - but they didn't necessarily consistently move the recommended five minutes every hour. Now, the wristband buzzes to alert its wearer if he or she hasn't got up in a while. But Nike is not the only company experimenting with wearable technology - particularly as estimates about the potential growth in the industry range from $10bn to $50bn (£6bn to £31bn) in the next five years. Competitor Fitbit recently released a new model, and Jawbone, iHealth, Garmin, Withings and Adidas are among other firms to offer dedicated fitness-measuring gadgets. Samsung and Sony recently released a smartwatch that can monitor a user's steps, and even Apple - whose boss, Tim Cook, sits on Nike's board of directors - has expressed an interest in a device. But beyond these gadgets, Nike's main competition might not be a rival band, but the smartphone. "Smartphones are going to start doing more of the tracking, and more people have them already and don't have to buy separate devices," says Sara Watson, a fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Already, there is a spate of apps - from MyMee to MapMyRun - capitalising on these built-in features. Beyond the competition, there is also the basic question: can wearing a wristband really make you healthier? "The notion of tracking itself has been around a long time - this is not something new," says Michael Kim, a former Microsoft Xbox executive who is now the head of Kairos Labs. "The problem is tracking does not create new behaviour change - it tracks what you already do as a behaviour," says Mr Kim, whose firm works to help people cement their habits. But some doctors say the bands can help those who are already interested in exercise better tailor their workouts. "We have done a number of athletic performance tracking projects with people," says Dr Paul Abramson, a physician in San Francisco who uses tracking technologies in his practice. "Things like the Fuelband or more complex versions of them can be very useful for people who want to exercise more." Companies are also showing an interest in tracking sensors. In 2008 Bank of America equipped dozens of its call centre staff with special badges to study the way they interacted with each other as part of efforts to boost productivity. One technology consultant suggested several firms were now interested in using fitness equipment as a way of encouraging their staff to bond. "At a symposium event last week I was talking to a couple of companies that were trying to improve employee engagement, and there's some thinking that not only are healthier employees more productive but that their sharing of information about how much they are walking, how much they are riding etc is becoming the new 'water cooler' moment," says Mike Gotta from Gartner. However, he cautions that managers should resist the temptation to see the gadgets as the human equivalent of the black boxes used by some car insurance companies to track driver behaviour. "A few months back one firm made the news for saying: 'If you don't meet certain criteria we're going to charge you more per month for your healthcare.' That kind of behaviour could create a backlash," Mr Gotta warns. "But if firms give these analytics to the employees for their own self-improvement and are relatively hands-off, then the workers will share the information themselves and that could create better relationships across teams." Experts also note that gadgets like the Fuelband still have plenty of room for improvement. At present the measurements it captures are not always precise. Rivals are attempting to address this by offering a wider range of sensors. Withings, for example, has built a heart-rate monitor into its Pulse tracker; Polar's Loop carries out a similar trick by connecting its wristband to a separate accessory; Fitbit includes an altimeter in its new Force wristband to count the number of stairs climbed; while Motorola's Motoactv can be linked up with bicycle-fitted sensors that measure how fast the equipment is being pedalled and its speed of travel. Sensors that measure skin temperature, perspiration and the electrical activity produced by muscles offer further opportunities. "The fitness space has spawned a whole host of explorations of tracking devices in other areas," says Steve Dean, a partner at Prehype and a founder of the Quantified Self group in New York, which meets to discuss personal data tracking projects and technologies. "It's almost like there's an endless amount of things that we can instrument on our body." </body>

      <body>People around the world are building their own drones. They offer a glimpse of what life will be like when the skies are filled with small, flying robots - and drones become as common as smartphones. Raphael Pirker was sitting on a bench at Washington Square Park on a blustery Friday in New York. A small drone called Discovery, a remotely controlled aircraft made by his company, TBS Avionics, was on the bench next to him. Nearby another drone was flying near a fountain. Even before he saw the drone, he heard it. "It's just like this, 'bzz-bzz'," he said. An onlooker watched the aircraft - "a beginner drone", Pirker said, crash into the pavement. Down the block hundreds of people had gathered at New York University for a Drones and Aerial Robotics Conference. Like Pirker, many of them were carrying their own drones. On a global scale the US and Israel are the world's biggest manufacturers of drones. Yet some European officials want to change the dynamic. Michel Barnier, a European Union commissioner, told a group of French journalists in July that Europeans should make their own drones, rather than rely exclusively on US- and Israeli-made ones. Pirker is also planning for the future. In Europe drones are used to make movies (see Smurfs 2). In the UK officials have granted permission to more than 130 companies and government agencies to fly drones, according to an Aerospace America report. In the US the Federal Aviation Administration has approved the use of drones for police and government agencies, issuing about 1,400 permits over the past several years. The civilian air space will reportedly be open to all kinds of drones in Europe by 2016 - and in the US by 2015. Many of these machines will be small - like the ones Pirker makes. And cheap. You can make a drone, explained South-African-born Mike Winn, of Drone Deploy, for $500 (£310). Pirker, 29, is a Swiss-Austrian who lives in Hong Kong - "for business reasons". He wears rimless glasses, the kind once worn by Apple guru Steve Jobs, and he has light blue eyes. Pirker and the others at the conference belong to a new breed of drone maker. Many are global travellers, and most grew up on drones. At the conference 14-year-old Riley Morgan approached Pirker, carrying a drone he had made. Another enthusiast, Russell de la Torre, who is 31, made his first robot, "a remote-controlled truck with cardboard boxes", at age 12. Pirker started building model airplanes when he was six. "I got bored because they were just flying circles around," he said, spinning his hand in the air in a lazy manner. As an adult he said: "I had this crazy idea of flying [a drone] over the Statue of Liberty. "Everybody said, 'Don't do that - you're doing to get shot.'" "It was a strange feeling," he said, describing the day three years ago when the drone flew, as shown in this head-spinning footage. "It felt a little bit eerie because you're flying past so much history, you know, about America." Drones give one a different perspective. "It's not the plane that turns in the air - it's the world that turns," he said. Drones do more than provide material for trippy videos, though. They help farmers check on crops and allow journalists to report stories. But even small drones - like the kind Pirker makes - cause problems. "Every country has different rules, but we follow our own," Pirker said. "We're not going to hurt anybody. We do it with a little bit of play." Not everyone sees his drones as whimsical. Federal Aviation Administration officials tried to fine Pirker $10,000 for operating a drone in Charlottesville, Virginia, in October 2011. His lawyer filed a motion three weeks ago, describing the aircraft, a "five-pound radio-controlled model airplane constructed of styrofoam", as harmless. Small drones are usually benign. Yet they can be lethal. Roman Pirozek, 19, died last month in Brooklyn, NY, when his remote-controlled helicopter spun out of control - and hit him in the head. Small drones also provide new ways to spy. A Seattle woman felt uneasy about a drone outside her window, as she reported earlier this year on a blog. Amie Stepanovich, director of a project on domestic surveillance at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, thinks drones are cool - and said Pirker's video was "gorgeous". But drones also worry her. "They are helping to usher in a new age of physical surveillance," she said. "They provide a platform for some of the most invasive surveillance technologies we've ever seen." Pirker has a different perspective. Rather than causing anxiety, drones have helped him get over his fear of heights - a handicap, since he lives in a high-rise in Tseung Kwan O, outside of Hong Kong, on the 40th floor. As he sat on the park bench in New York, he stuck out his leg and jiggled it, showing what used to happen when he looked down from a window in a tall building. Now he said: "I just step back." </body>

      <title>Supercell: Europe’s supercharged games success</title>
      <description>Clash of Clans games developer Supercell's $1.5bn deal</description>

      <body>It is a Finnish company started in 2010, whose first products only emerged in 2011. You've probably never heard of Supercell, but on Tuesday it was valued at $3bn, making it the fastest growing technology firm to come out of Europe in, well, just about ever. Supercell is a games business with just two titles, Clash of Clans and Hay Day, which until last week could only be played on Apple's iPhone and iPad. But they have grabbed a huge share of the mobile gaming market, leading the world in terms of revenue, ahead of giants like EA which has 829 titles to Supercell's two. On Tuesday Japan's Softbank paid $1.5bn to acquire a 51% stake in Supercell. The telecoms firm is doing the deal in conjunction with its own gaming subsidiary GungHo, another major player in the new world of mobile games. This might look like another of those dotcom deals, where a wealthy corporate giant pays over the odds for a business with big user numbers but no concrete business plan. But Supercell is making money hand over fist - revenues grew from $100m in 2012 to $179m in the first quarter of this year and are on course to hit $1bn for the whole year. Key to its success has been its ability to crack the Asian market, something many other games developers have tried and failed to do. It has already been working with GungHo and has now brought its games to Android, essential for any firm competing in China. It all looks like a great success for Finland, also home of the Angry Birds firm Rovio, and for the wider European technology scene. Supercell was backed by London-based venture capital firms including Index Ventures and Atomico. They bought in at a valuation of $770m back in February, so have made their investment back four times over in the space of six months - though existing investors will retain half of their stakes in the business. That means more money will now be available to invest in other start-ups, and even if Supercell is now controlled from Japan, Tuesday's news will be a great boost for the image of the European games industry. The UK firm behind the phenomenally successful Candy Crush Saga, King.com, is currently working on its stock market debut, while the Moshi Monsters business Mind Candy is also rumoured to be thinking of an IPO. Both may end up on New York's Nasdaq over the next year. What is slightly disappointing is that these companies seem to be looking outside Europe - to Asia or the US - when they are seeking the funding they need to progress to the next stage of their development. But European games developers are showing that they have mastered what consumers want in the mobile world and using their skills to build big businesses in a hurry. </body>

      <title>7 reasons why Buzzfeed is the death/saviour of news</title>
      <description>Rory's 7 reasons why you cannot ignore Buzzfeed</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24532004</url>
      <date>1381823426</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70483000/jpg/_70483141_untitled-1.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>The social news site Buzzfeed is growing at a scary rate, racing past serious news services like the New York Times - and the BBC - as the way younger people hear about what's happening around the world. It's even announced that it will be launching French, Spanish and Portuguese editions, using students and a language teaching platform called Duolingo to translate stories. So, in the spirit of a Buzzfeed list here are seven reasons why we should love/hate it: With 85 million visitors in August, it is fast becoming one of the most popular sites on the web. And look at where more than a billion Facebook users get their news - Buzzfeed is top of the list when it comes to stories shared by users, ahead of the Huffington Post, CNN and the BBC. And as the founder Jonah Peretti put it in a memo to staff, it's reaching an important audience: "The world needs sustainable, profitable, vibrant content companies staffed by dedicated professionals; especially content for people that grew up on the web, whose entertainment and news interests are largely neglected by television and newspapers." "This Baby Elephant Being Reunited With His Dad is The Cutest Thing You'll See Today" and "9 celebrity tweets you missed today" - if that is the future of journalism, heaven help us all… Some other Buzzfeed headlines today: "The Big Winner in JP Morgan's Earnings - lawyers", "Why These Three Economists Won The Nobel Prize", and "Blackberry's Last Ditch Attempt To Win You Over is Pretty Hilarious". There's business, technology and politics on Buzzfeed, and it's recruiting some serious journalist talent in the US and in London. When I met Jonah Peretti earlier this year and suggested that the cute and silly stuff was just part of a long term plan to fund serious investigative journalism he laughed. "You don't get it," he said. "We love the funny stories - it's what we're about." And some of the daft stuff is brilliantly done. Look at "The 29 Stages of A Twitterstorm." But serious or silly, it is all about clicks - any Buzzfeed writers who can't build an audience for their stories will soon be heading for the exit. The hardest trick in the modern media is making online news profitable - just ask anyone from The Guardian to The Sun. But as well as employing more than 400 people - technologists, journalists, marketing types - Buzzfeed is, according to Jonah Peretti, now making money. It was "accidentally" profitable once before in 2011, and then spent lots on expansion. Now it looks well placed to become a media powerhouse and without loads of intrusive advertising… Buzzfeed's clever trick is to teach advertisers to write Buzzfeed-like stories which promote their brands without in-your-face messages. On this morning's Today programme Jonah Peretti insisted that there was a clear division between "church and state", advertising and content. That may not be anything like as clear to Buzzfeed readers who click on "13 Signs You're Addicted To Fashion Blogs" without noticing that is sponsored by Blackberry UK. Mind you, whether that does any good to Blackberry is another matter entirely… 7. And here's a cute picture of a dog with a bandaged paw….. Well, if you can't beat them….. </body>

      <title>Why tech giants are investing in Africa</title>
      <description>Why the world’s technology giants are investing in Africa</description>

      <body>"I don't understand. Why is it that the media only seems to talk about Africa when bad things happen?" The man behind the counter at my hotel in the Ghanaian capital, Accra, was talking to me about my job, and why I was visiting. He looked genuinely pained. He told me he is a big fan of the BBC - in west Africa the World Service and language services have a big following - but it seemed to him that the media outside the continent often only noticed when bad things happened. It's arguably a fair point. That's not to say the positive stories don't get reported, but he can be forgiven for seeing the headlines and thinking all the world sees is war, famine and pestilence. In fact, Africa is booming, with growth of 5.6% predicted for 2013, according to the World Bank - although research suggests this has yet to trickle down to the very poorest on the continent. The middle class in sub-Saharan Africa is expanding rapidly. With the seemingly unstoppable growth of the mobile phone, greater access to the internet, and an increase in access to education, change is happening, and more people have more disposable income to spend. So it's no surprise that the big technology companies are investing in Africa. But is this the whole story? Is it driven by philanthropy or a desire to get in on the ground before their competitors? Or does Africa offer other opportunities? I spoke to three tech giants about why they were investing in the continent. The company has bolstered existing investments in the continent by opening a research facility in Nairobi, with the official inauguration celebration happening at the end of October. According to IBM, this is the first research facility that does both applied and exploratory research on the continent. "The key thing is… the great growth story of Africa," says Dr Kamal Bhattacharya, the director of IBM Research - Africa. "We know that financial inclusion is the big challenge. About 80% of the population has no access to financial services. There is the lack of access to energy, safe water, sanitation, food security. "As scientists we believe that science and technology is an enabler to express your needs, it is an enabler to shape your own future. "And this is why IBM is making this very significant investment into Africa, starting with Kenya. We've hired some of the top talent from all over the world, the African diaspora, people of African origin, also people who contribute to the growth of Africa, and we bring them all together here. "We believe research for Africa, solving Africa's grand challenges, has to be done on the ground in Africa and this is why we set up and made this investment." His colleague, Dr Uyi Stewart, is chief scientist at the lab. Originally from Nigeria, the role has brought him and his family back to the continent after nearly 10 years in New York. "People ask us: 'Can you do African research from New York?' Yes you can. It is possible, you can do research from anywhere. "But you will miss the mark... In order to capture value, and deliver innovation that leads to commercially viable products that impact people's lives, we have to be here, in the local ecosystem." Fernando de Sousa heads Microsoft's 4Afrika initiative, which focuses on encouraging innovation, increasing access to technology and building skills in the local workforce. The division backs projects across the continent including access to training, roll-out of broadband in rural areas, infrastructure, agriculture and healthcare projects, as well as their App Factories, hubs designed to nurture young developers creating apps for the Windows phone platform. Building these projects has a very personal resonance for Mr de Sousa, who was born in Mozambique and ended up spending time in a South African refugee camp as a child after the outbreak of civil war. "We said we want on focus on young people. We want to focus on skills, we want to focus on small and medium enterprises. We want to focus on access to technology. "Let's take Kenya - so we start with TV white spaces in a village in the Maasai Mara. "It's now evolved into a national policy conversation - President Kenyatta has said he wants 1.3 million students to have a [connected] device by September 2013. And he travelled to the Masai Mara to go and see what we're doing. "It's not just about networks, it's not just about PCs. It's about the end economic impact, it's about the skills. "[Now] we have 11 countries that have formally submitted requests for us to implement TV white spaces technology." But Mr de Sousa is clear about the motivation behind the initiative. "There is a corporate social investment part of Microsoft which has nothing to do with Microsoft 4Afrika. And I think that that is a well-established process, we do a lot of donations in that space. "This is about being on the ground and creating huge consumers. There's no debate about the fact that our objective is enabling economic development. "In proving the value of technology as the enabler for that development, it's not just creating consumption of technology, but it's actually more importantly creating the ability for knowledge to be developed, for technology to actually be built in Africa. "Because that actually drives the IT ecosystem, that drives the IT industry, that makes technology relevant." Isabel Kelly is the international director of the Salesforce.com Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the customer relationship management and services technology giant. She joined the company 11 years ago from campaigning group Amnesty International. The Foundation was started with an initial investment from the company, as well as access to Salesforce.com software, which is licensed to non-profits, and staff members volunteering. The first project in Africa for the Foundation was the suggestion of an employee, who had a brother who was volunteering in a school in the Kibagare slum in Nairobi. "We gave some refurbished hardware to them, we paid for them to get the internet," Ms Kelly says. "And so the school has taken on a bit of a focus on technology, we sponsored about 40 girls through the school, over the 10 years." One of the sponsored pupils from a particularly difficult background would go on to become a lawyer working for the Kenyan Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission. The Foundation has its own revenue stream from the bigger NGOs it works with (customers include the Grameen Foundation) and also funds training in how to use the Salesforce platform, and workshops for start-ups at places like Nairobi's iHub and mLab. Meanwhile, a host of social enterprises are using Salesforce tech to power their organisations - like Juhudi Kilimo, a micro-finance social enterprise, focusing on small, rural farmers in Kenya, and Honeycare, an organisation that helps farmers turn to honey production. </body>

      <title>The strange life of John McAfee</title>
      <description>The very strange life of millionaire John McAfee</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24441931</url>

      <body>Who is the real John McAfee? He's the man who went on the run after his neighbour was found dead, face-up, with a bullet in his head. He's the man who jump-started the multibillion-dollar anti-virus industry. And now he thinks he can make you invisible on the internet. Within tech circles he's long been a legend. But for most people, McAfee came to prominence last year when he fled his Central American home - teeth stained, hair dyed, in disguise - rather than let himself be questioned by authorities he accused of being corrupt. He tells the BBC he had "no connection whatsoever" with his neighbour's death. Police say he remains a "person of interest". Back in the US, after posting footage of young female "friends" stroking his naked tattooed torso, he now plans to neutralise the NSA's cyber-surveillance system. It might suggest a crazed, perhaps even deranged, personality. One journalist who has interviewed McAfee many times described him a "master manipulator" who lies and deceives. "I've been called paranoid, schizophrenic, the wild child of Silicon Valley," McAfee acknowledges. But he has a different perspective: "I'm an entrepreneur. I always have been. I am curious and I enjoy solving problems. "I think that it's when we step out of the road, step outside the box, become our own person and we walk fearlessly down paths other people wouldn't look at, that true progress comes. And sometimes true beauty as well. "We're missing that. We're missing the people who have the courage to walk into the wilderness just to see what's there." This is how Amy Emshwiller, the teenage ex-prostitute he lived with in Belize, describes him: "He's sweet, generous. He likes to like adventures. He's serious and usually he has a dark sense of humour. He's generally a sweet guy. He just doesn't like to be [expletive] with." So, who is the real John McAfee? To have any chance of knowing and gaining an informed opinion of what really motivated his erratic-sounding behaviour after the killing of Gregory Faull, you must travel deep into the 68-year-old's past. Despite his Southern accent, the bleached-blond and goateed businessman is in fact half-British - the son of an Englishwoman who met an American soldier stationed in the UK during World War II. "I feel as much British as I do American," McAfee says. "There's not much difference between our countries." They moved to Virginia when he was young, where he had a troubled childhood. His father was an abusive alcoholic who, when McAfee was aged 15, shot himself dead. In the following years, McAfee says, he too began drinking heavily and taking drugs, but still managed to maintain a promising academic career. That came to an end in the late 1960s when Northeast State Louisiana State College terminated his PhD in mathematics after it was revealed that he had slept with an undergraduate he was mentoring. They later married and McAfee turned his skills to a series of programming jobs with some of the biggest tech organisations of the time including Nasa, General Electric, Siemens, Univac and Xerox, all the while continuing to indulge in his addictions. "Most of my bosses also used drugs of some kind," he says. "I was in the tech field, after all, we were the leading edge in technology and the leading age in personal experimentation. "I had to hide it from my mother and sometimes from my wife. But in the work environment - depending on where you worked - in some companies drugs were taken openly at lunchtime in people's offices. It was a bizarre time." Matters came to a head in the early 1980s after his wife left him, his most recent employer, Omex, let him go and the scale of his drug dependency forced him to seek help. "It was 1984, the last time that I took drugs, drank alcohol or sold drugs for that matter," he says. "I simply stopped. I started going to an organisation called Alcoholics Anonymous... and that was my last taste of that world. "However, it is still with me. My body is covered with tattoos from that period. And I'm afraid some of my ideas and concepts and attitudes that were moulded during that time are still with me. That's why people think, perhaps, I'm a little bit off the wall." Despite his troubles, McAfee managed to land a job at defence contractor Lockheed Martin, where he worked on a classified voice-recognition program. There he came across an unusual bit of self-replicating code designed to copy itself on to any floppy disk inserted into affected computers. When examined, it contained the message: "Welcome to the dungeon. Beware of this VIRUS." "When I first read about the Pakistani Brain virus, I'd never heard of a virus before, neither had anyone in technology," remembers McAfee. "It fascinated me." He worked out a way to disinfect the computers and then spread the cure via the bulletin board system, a precursor to the web. The challenge inspired him to set up a business of his own: McAfee Associates - a firm that would later be sold, years after he had left, to Intel for more than $7.6bn (£4.7bn). "I knew the field would become extremely large because people being who they are, there will always be hackers," he says. "It's why we have graffiti on the walls of the inner city. People like to deface things. They like to disrupt things. "So, given that fact, computer viruses were not going to go away and were only going to get worse. I just did what I could to be at the forefront of that industry for as long as I could." Despite this, he says, he has never himself used any of the products made by the firm that continues to bear his name. "I'm constantly under attack, yet I use no software protection. "I protect myself by constantly changing my IP [internet protocol] address, by not attaching my name to any device I use, and by not going on to sites where you might pick up a virus. "Porn sites, for example, I just don't go there. "Secondly, I practise safe computing. If someone sends me an email with a link, I'm not going there until I can call the person to verify that they sent me the email. "It sounds absurd to live that way, but I would rather trust my own devices and thoughts than someone else's software." After selling his stake in the business in 1994, McAfee went on to found and sell other companies, including an instant messaging system, a firewall provider and a ranch from which he offered flights in "trikes" - low-flying, engine-powered cabins suspended from hang-gliders. Then he headed south. In 2008, at an age others might be thinking of putting up their feet, McAfee moved to the jungle of Belize with the stated intention of trying to cure another kind of infection. "I came across a concept called quorum sensing, which is the technique that bacteria use to communicate with each other. "Up until about 10 years ago we didn't even know that bacteria did communicate, but we find out they have a very sophisticated communication system. I wanted to explore and investigate that to see if we could come up with new antibiotics." He picked the area, he says, because the plants that grew along the country's Rio Nuevo river contained compounds that inhibit bacteria from sending chemical signals to each other and thus thwart their ability to co-ordinate an attack. Things didn't go as planned. The first sign of trouble was when journalists invited to his Carmelita, Orange Walk, base wrote stories that made clear they did not know what to make of the operation. Then a falling-out with the microbiologist he was working with, Allison Adonizio, put the project at risk when she quit. Dr Adonizio, who is now based in Philadelphia, did not want to be interviewed. In April 2012, matters came to a head when the Belize police force's Gang Suppression Unit raided the research facility. McAfee says the officers claimed they suspected it was being used to make the illegal psycho-stimulant methamphetamine. They shot his dog, he says, confiscated both his passport and licensed weapons on the property, and briefly imprisoned him before dropping the charges. "Under no circumstances did they really believe it was a meth lab," he states. "Everybody knew it was a biotech lab because I had hired half of the people in the village to work there. They all knew what I was doing. "It's a pirate haven. It's an extremely corrupt and dangerous place. "I knew this and my friends all advised me against it. I just thought I was smart enough to sidestep it. Unfortunately, I was not. "I was there for a year and the local politician sent a representative and asked for $2m for a campaign donation. I said no. Two weeks later they raided my compound." McAfee says when he was asked a second time for the cash he went on a publicity blitz, posting messages online, and speaking to local and international press about the incident. It became political. The Belize Times - published by the leading opposition party - suggested the "barbaric assault" on McAfee was a "global black eye" for the nation and a threat to its tourist industry. "I do wish that I were smarter socially," reflects McAfee. "I think I have the ability to solve mathematical equations and programming issues very easily, but I am a little bit naive in some social situations. And certainly in Belize I was way naive." At the time of the raid, McAfee had begun an affair with a 16-year-old ex-prostitute he had met on Belize Independence Day. "I was partying, I was drinking, and I went into this bar and the owner said a friend wants to meet me and likes me," remembers Amy Emshwiller, who still lives in Belize. "[He said] can I have your number, and then two weeks later he called me." She says he was unaware she was less than a quarter of his age. "He didn't know how old I was. I lied to him saying I was 18, and he thought it was OK. "I let him fall in love first before I told him my age. "When I told him he was so [expletive] shocked that he didn't know what to do. He was baffled. And he was like: 'I still love you, I don't know what to do. I'm in love with a young girl.' That's how that happened." McAfee's long-term American girlfriend left him. And like many things in his life, the new affair proved complicated. One night Emshwiller took McAfee's gun. She aimed it at his head, squeezed her eyes shut and pulled the trigger. She missed. He continued the relationship. "Amy, for one - and many girls in Belize - has a horrific story of abuse that if I told you, you could not believe it," McAfee explains. "Of course she's not going to be well. Of course she's going to have issues. "When she tried to shoot me in the head what I saw was a frightened child. "What I saw was a confused girl who had been so abused - physically, sexually, emotionally - beyond any description. "What are you going to do? Throw her out? That doesn't help her. "All she did was burst my eardrum. I'm deaf in one ear now, but I don't have a bullet in my head. Forgiveness is one of the graces that we have as human beings. Can I be faulted for indulging in it?" Emshwiller confirms the event but says she wanted to scare, not kill, him after he had said he wanted another girl. She adds it was not the only such incident provoked by her jealousy. "One time before, I held him in the corner and I put a knife at his throat," she says. "And he just said: 'Go ahead. Kill me.' And I couldn't do it. I just dropped the knife and walked out." Following the raid, McAfee and Emshwiller moved to his villa at San Pedro - a town on Belize's biggest island, Ambergris Caye - where they agreed to have an open relationship. There they were visited by Chad Essley, a cartoonist, who began collaborating on a book about McAfee's life. "I didn't quite realise that his lifestyle would be this older guy surrounded by young girls and bodyguards with guns," he says. "Many of these girls were former prostitutes or had very rough lives. "It was expressly forbidden to go out in the town and drink - the smell of alcohol, he could not be around it. He didn't want any of the girls doing any drugs at all. "I interviewed each of these girls, got their background. They were incredibly sad. They were definitely in a better sort of situation being around John." Meanwhile next door, Gregory Faull, an Orlando sports bar owner who had recently divorced and decided to live in his Belize holiday home, was becoming increasingly irate at his neighbour's activities. On Thursday, 8 November 2012, McAfee made the local headlines when he donated 40 stun guns, handcuffs and batons to the local police at a press conference. Mayor Daniel Guerrero thanked him, stating: "Crime is affecting the tourism industry as we have been listed on travel advisories; it is time to stop this. Let us protect our industry and turn San Pedro into the safe haven once more." That night the local TV bulletin declared that "the hatchet was formally buried", suggesting the rift between McAfee and Belize's authorities had ended. Early on Sunday morning, Mr Faull was found dead in a pool of his blood by his housekeeper. Police called to the scene found a single 9mm shell nearby. They said a mobile phone and laptop were missing but there were no visible signs of a forced entry. The head of the police's Gang Suppression Unit told a local newspaper that his officers wanted to speak to McAfee as part of the investigation, but when they called at his house he did not appear to be in. An article posted the following day by Wired magazine revealed why. McAfee told the publication he had seen the officers approaching and had hidden in the sand of his property putting a cardboard box over his head. He recalls that his caretaker had told him of Mr Faull's murder, and now he feared for his own life. "The first thing that came to my mind was, 'Oh, my Lord. The government is finally trying to rid themselves of me,' he says. "The government does from time to time. "I had certainly been a huge thorn in their side, and they had simply got the wrong white man. "Seriously, this is what went through my mind. My friends sort of calmed me down, and later said that's absurd. At the time I did not think so." McAfee acknowledges that he and Mr Faull had been at odds, but plays down the idea they hated each other or that he suspected him of being the person who had fed two of Emshwiller's dogs a poisoned tortilla. "The entire five years I was there, I'd said maybe 15 words to him," he says. "He did not like my dogs and the past two occasions I had seen him walking on the beach he complained. But so did everybody. "There was no ongoing argument. Yeah, he was mad about my dogs. Maybe as I'm beginning to think now, maybe he was the one who poisoned them. At the time I certainly did not believe that." In fact, as ABC News later revealed, Mr Faull had filed a complaint to Mayor Guerrero about McAfee the previous month. It said McAfee's dog had attacked a tourist; that his security guards had "terrified" other residents by walking around with shotguns and shining lights in their eyes, and that taxis and other traffic had been arriving at his property "at all hours", causing a disturbance. "I did not find that out until weeks after I came back to the States," says McAfee when pressed about this. "Belize is not like America where you file a complaint and then the police come out and chase things out. You file a complaint and it goes into a drawer." McAfee then went on the run, saying he feared he would be "silenced" if he was caught and thrown in jail. It made headlines worldwide, in no small part due to the fact that he was posting updates to a blog and giving frequent interviews - actions he says were designed to ensure he couldn't be made to disappear if he had been caught. "I disguised myself as a ragged salesman," he recalls. "All it takes is some dirty clothes and not bathing for a few days and not combing my hair. "You know, people saw my photograph everywhere because all of the police and army had it for that month and a half I was underground. I just made sure I looked different than that." Questioned about the affair, Dean Barrow, Belize's prime minister, made it clear McAfee was not an official murder suspect, and had only been classed instead a "person of interest". "I don't want to be unkind to the gentleman, but I believe he is extremely paranoid, even bonkers," the politician added. During this time McAfee continued to see Emshwiller. "When he was on the run I went for lunches with him and then he would call and say: 'Come to this place, or go there,' she recalls. "How to come, when to come. Not to go out, or stay home, or go to a different location. He would tell me that so nobody would get me." She adds that she regrets she did not go with him when he finally decided to escape the country. The next major development came on 3 December when a reporter and photographer from Vice magazine revealed they were documenting McAfee's life on the run. In what proved a frustrating twist for the tech guru, they then unwittingly revealed he had crossed the border to Guatemala - a fact revealed by a photo uploaded to the Vice website by staff at its headquarters, who failed to wipe its location data. "I had gone out of my way to arrange the escape and I was breathing easily and looking forward to a few days of relaxation," remembers McAfee. "We immediately had to go on the run again because we were in Guatemala illegally at this point. But it was no-one's real fault. It was just the fault of the moment." A few days later McAfee was arrested. There was initially speculation he would be sent back to Belize, but a week later he was allowed to fly to Miami a free man. "After it was over I asked myself, 'Good Lord, I must have been afraid,'" he says. "But I really can't remember. I remember merely trying to solve the problems that occurred as they occurred." McAfee has offered a $25,000 bounty for information relating to Mr Faull's death, but says an attempt to contact the victim's family proved unsuccessful. The family has called the reward a "hollow gesture" and suggested if McAfee really wanted to help he would have met with the Belize police. A spokesman for the country's government said its authorities still wanted to speak to the businessman. "Mr McAfee's claims and his behaviour have been extreme," he told the BBC. "The investigation is ongoing and McAfee remains a person of interest. If McAfee were to respond to questioning it would make a difference to the progress of the investigation - but this is currently out of the hands of the government of Belize." So long as the crime remains unsolved, it is inevitable the entrepreneur will always face suspicion. But he says he can live with that. "There's always going to be someone who likes you and someone who dislikes you," he says. "Someone who thinks you're a hero and some that think you're a villain. You know I just do what I can in situations like this to continue to state that I'm totally innocent." That doesn't mean he is trying to forget his time in Belize. In addition to the graphic novel, he is working with a Canadian firm to make both a documentary and a movie about his time there. He adds that George Jung - the imprisoned cocaine drugs lord portrayed by Johnny Depp in the film Blow - has been picked to write his biography. While those projects brew, McAfee has returned to Silicon Valley, announcing the forthcoming launch of a $100 gadget that he promises can make you invisible on the net. "If you cannot see it, you cannot hack it, you cannot look at it, you cannot spy on anything happening inside it," he explains. He says the D-Central units will fit in people's pockets and allow their phones, tablets and PCs to communicate with other owners' devices within a three-block radius. He adds they can also connect to the net anonymously via a node - a separate piece of equipment attached to the network - either directly or with their encrypted data relayed relayed via other D-Central boxes. Each will frequently change their network identifier - a long number used by devices as an ID - making them hard to track, he explains. He suggests it will appeal to college students who want to copy music anonymously and to businesses wanting to prevent the theft of corporate secrets. He's also well aware that in the light of Edward Snowden's leaks about surveillance techniques used by the US and UK governments, part of the appeal will be thwarting their efforts. "You know from their own paranoia and desire to stay in power, they are watching everything they can," he says. Will the tech work? Will he really frustrate the authorities once again? At this point, like so much of John McAfee's life, it's impossible to be sure of all the facts and it's ultimately up to you whether you take him at his word. </body>

      <body>Campaigners are calling for restrictions on the way magazines airbrush photos. Seeing your face and body transformed is an unnerving experience. My guilty pleasure is fashion and gossip magazines. I will check out those unflattering bikini shots of celebrities and be amazed at how their "fat-busting diet" did such a great job on their abs in just six weeks. Or swoon over the flawless skin of that A-lister advertising the latest £10,000 handbag in just her pants and wonder, "Why doesn't my skin/hair/teeth look like that?" It's no secret that advertisers and magazines use airbrushing to give their images an aspirational sheen. It's been happening for years. In 2008 it was reported that magazines could soon be banned from using airbrushed photographs of celebrities, such was the anxiety over teenage eating disorders. It didn't happen. Women and equalities minister Jo Swinson says that manipulating people's bodies in photographs is "one of the most pernicious types of retouching". But she's against a ban. It would be hard to police. The responsibility is on people taking photographs and creating the images afterwards to "think about the audience their image is going to and what is appropriate", she says. Normally the debate is cast in terms of teenage girls and whether they are being sold a false reality. But what does it actually feel like to be airbrushed? I decided to find out. I wasn't brave enough to be photographed with no make-up so I had a base layer of foundation and powder as well as minimal eye make-up and some blusher and lip-gloss. Photoshoots are a weird experience. "Look to the side... put your hands on your hips... smile... don't smile... don't smile so widely," I'm told. Photographer Sarah Brimley helps me relax to try to get my best "natural" picture. She has worked with some of the biggest models in fashion as well as a number of celebrities. It's standard to retouch photos for small things like skin, fixing stray hairs, she says. "Digital cameras are so sharp that retouching is even more necessary because you can see every little blemish on the skin. In film you never used to see that." Extreme airbrushing is rare, she believes. The exception is celebrities. "They'll say can you make my nose different-shaped or make me slimmer. It happens with almost every celebrity we photograph." The most common request is to make the waist "go in a bit" or make the legs longer, she says. Insiders know all this. "But the general public who don't understand the industry, they think these people look like that and they don't," Brimley says. She did a lovely job with my photos and I thought the untouched images were actually quite flattering. Then it was time for the post-production. It was a brutal experience. Like most fashion photographers, Brimley does post-production on all the pictures she takes, but never to extremes. But I wanted to see what was possible so I asked her to do a more extreme job than she would ever normally do. She took around 10 years and three stone off me. All in less than an hour. Every blemish vanished from my skin, as did the scar on my forehead. She whitened my face, lengthened my neck, changed the shape of my nose, widened my eyes, elongated my legs, sliced off parts of my arms and thighs and narrowed my hips. Suddenly the original images that I was quite happy with at the start, looked old, tired and a bit chubby. Georgina Wilkin, 23, a former model who developed an eating disorder because of the pressures of the job, recognises the phenomenon. "I've had a few times where I've worked for a magazine and the magazine's come out and I hardly even recognise myself. My legs have been skimmed off, my pores have been eliminated, my nose has been straightened. " The result can be humiliating. "I felt awful - you feel that what you are as a human being isn't good enough." Magazines are not shackled by rules. In 2003 there was controversy after GQ editor Dylan Jones admitted airbrushing a cover image of Kate Winslet, who spoke in the interview about the attractions of curvier women. In contrast, adverts are covered by regulations. The Advertising Standards Authority says there's nothing inherently wrong with retouching images. Only 63 of its 30,000 complaints last year related to post-production. But airbrushing must be done responsibly, says Vena Raffle, the agency's head of investigations. "We step in where we think the techniques lead the ad to be misleading, harmful or offensive, or where it's socially irresponsible." That last definition is hard to pin down. Is it socially irresponsible to make an actress's legs longer and arms skinnier in a photo? And what about giving extremely skinny women bigger breasts and hips? In 2010 the former editor of Cosmopolitan admitted to airbrushing anorexic models to make them look healthier. Airbrushing is creating impossible expectations, Wilkin argues. "Models in magazines and mannequins in shops - that body is not achievable. It seems like it's moving further and further away from reality." Eating disorder charity Beat is calling for a ban on airbrushing that changes the shape of the body. Susan Ringwood, its chief executive, says people have become so used to this alternative norm that they no longer notice. "Because it's everywhere we've lost some of our critical faculties in understanding this is no longer real." There's an alternative view - that this is just an inevitable part of technological change. "In the old days it was lots of make-up, very careful selection of models and good lighting and countless takes with cameramen and lighting engineers, who made sure the absolutely perfect take was got," says Ian Twinn of the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers. "Now it can be done more quickly, people can manipulate and change, airbrush and digitally enhance the image afterwards." Consumers are not stupid, he says. They know and want to buy into a dream, he argues. The same could be said for magazine readers or TV viewers. It's not clear what effect this is having on today's teenagers. Jemma, a 14 year-old schoolgirl who wants to be a model or actor, uses post-production techniques herself. She edits the selfies that she puts on social media. "Sometimes I like how I look naturally but you have to take loads of pictures to get the right one. Most of the pictures I put on Instagram or Facebook will be edited. I'll lighten them, hide spots, things like that." Even though she is aware of airbrushing techniques, Jemma says it is something she forgets about while flicking through a glossy magazine. "Because I'm not thinking about it, you just think they're really skinny and that must be real." Looking again at my airbrushed images, there's something else I lost - any sign of a personality. I look like a clone, almost inhuman. My head is too big for my skinny body, the portrait picture doesn't seem to look like me at all. The models used in these magazines are of course naturally stunning and won't need anywhere near the work I had, but it's simultaneously comforting and frightening how much they can change a person. So next time I see that flawless face or those impossibly long legs and think, "Why don't I look like that?", I'll remind myself, that with a bit of help from Photoshop, I actually can. Having seen the result, it's not a look I'll be revisiting any time soon. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook Have you airbrushed yourself?

      <title>Ex-BBC man guilty of sex attacks</title>
      <description>Ex-BBC Radio Norfolk broadcaster Michael Souter is found guilty of historical sex attacks on boys.</description>

      <body>A former BBC radio presenter described as a "dominant predator" has been found guilty of sexually abusing boys. Ex-BBC Radio Norfolk and Radio Clyde broadcaster Michael Souter, 60, was convicted of 19 sexual assaults on seven boys aged between 11 and 16. Souter was a Venture Scouts leader, a volunteer mentor to young people and was even allowed to adopt a child. Judge Mark Lucraft warned him he faced "a long period of imprisonment" when he is sentenced on 31 October. Souter, of Loddon, Norfolk, stared straight ahead without emotion as the judge spoke. The jury at Norwich Crown Court also found him guilty of seven counts of making and possessing indecent images of under-18s, after a six-week trial. He faced two more counts of possessing indecent images of a child, but was cleared of one and the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict on the other. He was remanded in custody. The court heard Souter used his celebrity status to abuse his victims. He carried out the attacks between 1979 and 1999. The jury of nine men and three women took three hours to reach their verdicts. After the trial, detectives revealed they were investigating further allegations of abuse against Souter. Norfolk Police confirmed a "live inquiry" was continuing into outstanding claims. A total of 595 people have been identified as witnesses and it is understood a number have raised concerns about his behaviour. Det Insp Paul Brown, of Norfolk police's child abuse investigation unit, said Souter had shown no remorse. "In the trial the evidence was overwhelming and he denied what had appeared to be really obvious," he said. "There's no doubt in my mind his interaction with different agencies and organisations was based around the persona that he had around the county. "He used that to ingratiate himself into situations to allow him to offend." Sheila Lock, interim director of children's services for Norfolk County Council, said that when Souter first volunteered as a mentor for vulnerable youngsters, he underwent a "robust" assessment before he was allowed any contact with children. "No concerns were raised through police checks, interviews or references," she said. When abuse allegations came to light in 1993, the council took them "extremely seriously", she added. "We worked alongside police to investigate the concerns and took appropriate protective action to safeguard the children Souter had had contact with. "Souter was clearly a manipulative and predatory man and it is right that he will now serve many years in prison, having added to his victims' suffering by forcing them to give evidence. "Souter's victims have shown incredible courage in coming forward after so many years and today's verdict proves it is never too late to speak out." Chris McCann, head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) complex casework unit for the East of England, said: "Michael Souter presented himself to people as a local celebrity from radio and television, happy to be involved in charity events, the Scout movement and as a youth mentor for Norfolk social services. "All this was a smokescreen to hide his true intention: to become close to young boys so he could sexually abuse them, confident that his celebrity status would mean they would not be believed." A BBC spokesman said: "The crimes that Michael Souter has been found guilty are truly shocking and the BBC condemns them in the strongest possible terms. "Michael Souter has not worked for the BBC since the early 1990s." A spokesman for the Scout Association said Souter had not been a member for 25 years. "The Scout Association condemns the actions of Souter and is pleased that the judicial process is now complete and he will now be punished for his crimes," he said. The association had co-operated fully throughout this case, he added. "We can confirm that he will never be allowed to work within the Scout Movement again," he said. </body>

      <title>Muslim free school 'dysfunctional'</title>
      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby is criticised by Ofsted inspectors as "dysfunctional" and rated inadequate in every category.</description>

      <body>A Muslim free school has been damned by Ofsted inspectors as "dysfunctional" and rated inadequate in every category - within a year of it opening. An inspection at Derby's Al-Madinah school was brought forward after fears were raised over teaching standards. The report says teachers there are inexperienced and have not been provided with proper training and that the school requires special measures. The school said it accepted the report and would use it to move forward. Reacting to the findings, David Cameron told BBC Radio Derby: "If they don't take immediate action to deal with these things then I think it is right it should close and I think it's absolutely right to intervene rapidly when these things aren't working properly." However, he added: "Let's not use this as a stick with which to beat the whole free school movement - there are now hundreds of schools which have set up as free schools, and on average they have more outstanding and good ratings than established schools. "When it goes wrong - just as with a state school - you've got to get in there and sort it out, or close it down," he said. The Ofsted inspection had been due to take place by the end of the year but was prioritised following initial allegations that female teachers were obliged to wear hijabs and boys and girls were segregated. The school has since written to pupils and staff telling them there is no requirement to cover their hair. Education minister Lord Nash last week warned the school it faced closure unless discrimination against female staff and pupils stopped. A spokesperson said: "We were already investigating this school before allegations became public. We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection. "We have received a response from the Al-Madinah Education Trust as well as a report on the school from Ofsted. Any decisions made will take into account all the available evidence." The Ofsted report found that pupils were given the same work "regardless of their different abilities" and the governing body was "ineffective". It said basic systems were not in place, describing the school as being "in chaos" and "dysfunctional". Boys and girls had different lunch sittings but the report said this was due to the small size of the canteen. Inspectors gave the school the lowest ranking - "inadequate" - in every area, prompting the chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw to call for it to be placed in special measures. This means Ofsted will carry out inspections at the school at short notice to monitor improvements. If poor performance continues the school could be closed. Dr Stuart Wilson, the acting head teacher, said there were "significant and serous problems" at the school and accepted some of the lessons were not meeting necessary standards. "Are special measures a disaster for the school? Yes, they are," said Dr Wilson. "It's not where we want the school to be at this time but we accept the report." In one mathematics lesson, described by Ofsted as "insufficiently challenging", pupils spent the majority of their time cutting out and pasting shapes. Dr Wilson said the school, which has 412 pupils aged between four and 16, had a lot of issues to deal with but he insisted it did have a future. "Obviously the report doesn't make pleasant reading for anybody - we don't want to be in this position - we wish we weren't in this position - but what we need to do now is to accept the report in full and use it to move the school forward." Writing to the school's chair of governors on Thursday, Lord Nash said the Ofsted report was "further compelling evidence of the breaches of the funding agreement I have required you to address". "Contrary to your suggestion that I have acted prematurely, I am even more convinced of the need for very decisive and urgent action on the part of the trust to comply with all your obligations and remedy the serious failings at the school." One parent told the BBC: "I know they are teaching my children well. I'm seeing their progress and I have no concerns at all about the school." Another, Razwana Akbar, said: "I am very angry. They have broken the trust as professional teachers, they have let us down." Chris Williamson, MP for Derby North, said: "Frankly, the position of Al-Madinah school is now untenable and I would fully expect the school to close and for the children to be found alternative places in the council schools in the city." Speaking in Parliament earlier, shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said the Ofsted report was a "devastating blow to the education secretary's flagship policy". He said: "It reveals that pupils have been failed on every possible measure and parents will want to know why the education secretary has allowed this to happen." He described the government's free school programme as a "dangerous free-for-all". "David Cameron and Michael Gove can no longer ignore this issue - it is a crisis entirely of their own making," he said. But speaking at the weekend, Mr Hunt told BBC One's Andrew Marr programme that although Labour would not open new free schools "along the Michael Gove model", the bulk of existing free schools would be kept open as his party wanted to "keep the good free schools". Responding to Mr Hunt's more recent comments, the schools minister David Laws said that the government had taken "swift action" to deal with failings at the Al-Madinah free school told MPs that no school would be allowed to "languish in failure". He also accused Labour of "total and utter opportunism" using the report "to shift its position". </body>

      <title>Teachers' strike closes schools</title>
      <description>Thousands of schools close across much of England as teachers strike over pay, pensions and jobs.</description>

      <body>Thousands of schools were closed across much of England as teachers went out on strike over pay, pensions and jobs. Teachers in London, Cumbria, the South East, North East and South West have been taking part with nearly 3,500 schools shut or partially closed. The action was part of a continuing campaign of regional strikes involving members of the NUT and NASUWT unions. Prime Minister David Cameron said the strike was "inconvenient for parents" and "not good for pupils' education". NUT general secretary Christine Blower, said the union regretted the disruption caused to pupils and parents but teachers felt they had "no other choice". Major rallies have been taking place in Bristol, Durham and London, with smaller events in other areas, including Brighton, Carlisle and Plymouth. Teachers are objecting to proposals by Education Secretary Michael Gove to bring in performance-related pay, increase their workloads and make changes to their pensions. Twenty out of 33 London boroughs provided information to BBC London 94.9 about the number of schools affected. Of those, about 445 schools were completely closed and 450 partially closed. And in Tyne and Wear, at least 471 schools were affected by the industrial action. Head teacher Roberta Kirby, from Fernhurst Junior School, in Portsmouth, said the government had "declared war" on teachers. More than 200 schools in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight were affected by the action. She said: "If we cannot offer good wages and a pension that staff pay into that reflects the work they do, then we are not going to be able to attract the best graduates." Responding to the impact of the strike, some parents said they had found it difficult to find alternative childcare. The BBC's Sarah Ransome said: "People in Plymouth have been telling me that finding alternative childcare because of the strike has been 'quite a headache'." A similar walkout by teachers took place in the east of England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber region on 1 October. Ms Blower said: "Mr Gove has done nothing to address the crisis of low morale in the teaching profession which threatens the continued provision of high quality education." Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said the "overwhelming majority of teachers" were on strike. She said: "Teachers are committed and dedicated public service workers. They do not take strike action lightly. "No teacher has any wish to inconvenience parents or disrupt pupils' education, but this action is not the failure or due to the unreasonableness, of teachers." Plans for a national one-day walkout before Christmas have also been announced by the two unions. Speaking to BBC Sussex, Mr Cameron said responsibility for the strike "lies with the teaching unions". "I think it is very disappointing they have decided to go on strike," he said. "And when we look at the things they are striking over, pensions and pay, they are things that have been decided independently by well-led reviews. "I was at my children's school today in London. One class was not there but the rest of the school was operating. "So, every praise to those teachers who have gone ahead and kept our schools open for our kids." A spokeswoman for the Department for Education (DfE) said 27% of the schools in the affected regions were closed. However, there was no figure available for how many were partially closed. She said: "The NUT and NASUWT have tried to create as much disruption for pupils and parents today as possible. "In spite of this, thanks to many hardworking teachers and heads, only around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed today." </body>

      <body>Six British soldiers who died in an Afghan bomb blast claimed by the Taliban were "unlawfully killed on active service", a coroner has ruled. The six men were on patrol in a Warrior armoured vehicle when it triggered a device on 6 March last year. Recording a narrative verdict, Oxfordshire coroner Darren Salter said there was "nothing their comrades could have done to rescue or save them". A series of improvements have been made to Warriors since the incident. Sgt Nigel Coupe, 33, of 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, was killed alongside Cpl Jake Hartley, 20, Pte Anthony Frampton, 20, Pte Christopher Kershaw, 19, Pte Daniel Wade, 20, and Pte Daniel Wilford, 21, all of 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment. The attack, which was so powerful it turned their vehicle upside down and blew off its gun turret, was the biggest single loss of life in an enemy attack for UK Afghanistan forces since 2001. Two Warriors left on a patrol from a base at Lashkar Gah, southern Afghanistan, just after 18:30 local time. Soon after, the Warrior travelling in front triggered a pressure plate which detonated an improvised explosive device (IEDs). A fire broke out almost instantly, setting off ammunition inside the vehicle, the inquest heard. Fellow soldiers tried, in vain, to put out the fire and get into the bombed vehicle. The inquest heard evidence from pathologists who said the men were likely to have been killed or rendered unconscious immediately by the blast. "This, of course, is a tragic loss of these six soldiers and these young lives," Mr Salter said. "At least it is very clear from the evidence of the two pathologists and the evidence of those who witnessed the strike that they did not suffer." He said he was "not going to second-guess decisions of commanders in a courtroom today; that is not the purpose of an inquest". "These are experienced commanders who took decisions on the ground, balancing the risks and exercising judgements," he added. He said it was clear "significant steps" had been taken to improve the vehicles. Oxford Coroner's Court heard on Thursday from Warrior expert Maj Douglas Nelson who said it had been "a very large device - and what I would say is, no vehicle that we had was designed to take that". He said that, while the Mastiff armoured vehicle was specifically designed with improvised IEDs in mind, the Warrior was "infinitely more capable" of fighting at night, when the attack took place. Maj Nelson was among a number of soldiers who told the inquest they felt safest, when on patrol, in a warrior. "Of any vehicle, I would travel in Warrior," he said. "It's as good as we can make it." He said improvements made to the vehicles since the attack included thicker armour, better fire-fighting and detection systems and improvements to ways of getting out in an emergency. Improved fuel tanks were also being fitted to the vehicles, he added. The inquest heard that, when the order was given to leave at 18:00, Pte Kershaw had volunteered to take the place of another soldier, who was just returning from a shower. Speaking after the verdict, his mother, Monica, said it was "a pure quirk of fate that Chris should have been kitted up and got into a patrol for which he was not intended". "I am still struggling with this but how like him to be ready to do his duty for his fellow soldiers," she said. And Emma Hickman, who has battled to prove her fiance, Pte Wade, fathered her daughter before he was killed in the incident, said: "From the struggle to establish Lexie's identity and hearing all the evidence it has been an exhausting ordeal and still we have not come to terms with our loss." The Ministry of Defence released Pte Wade's DNA last year so Ms Hickman could prove paternity and put his name on the birth certificate of their daughter, Lexie-Mai. </body>

      <body>A school which let pupils as young as 11 smoke in the playground has been ordered to stop the practice. Leeds City Council education bosses stepped in after learning children at Elmete Central School in Roundhay, Leeds, were allowed to smoke. It is understood cigarettes were confiscated at the start of the day but returned at break times in an attempt to stop pupils playing truant. Elmete caters for 75 pupils with educational and behavioural issues. Paul Brennan, deputy director for children's services, said the council spoke with the school's recently-appointed head teacher Lesley Boyd as soon as it was made aware pupils were smoking on the premises. He said he was now "confident" the practice had ceased. "The recently-appointed head teacher has agreed to review any such practices, and to make sure this does not happen in the future we will conduct unannounced visits by local authority staff," he said. "We have a strict no-smoking policy in all of our schools and encourage them to promote healthy lifestyles to all pupils." A council spokesman added that Lesley Boyd was not the head teacher at the time the policy was introduced. </body>

      <body>A coroner has pleaded guilty to a £2m fraud that saw him steal some of the money from the estates of dead people. Gloucestershire coroner Alan Crickmore, 57, of East Approach Drive, Cheltenham pleaded guilty to 24 counts of fraud at Southwark Crown Court. Police said Crickmore had been stealing money while acting as probate and using the cash as his own "piggy bank". Crickmore was bailed and electronically tagged ahead of a sentencing hearing on 28 November. The guilty plea followed a police inquiry into alleged breaches of the solicitors' code of conduct and accounting rules. He was suspended from his post in December 2010 and has now resigned. Alan C Crickmore Solicitors, which had an office in Cheltenham, was closed down by the Solicitors Regulation Authority in December 2010. An authority spokesman said it was likely Crickmore would face a tribunal over his actions. He said a final decision would be made after Crickmore was sentenced. Det Ch Insp Dave Sellwood said Crickmore's plea came after being "faced with overwhelming evidence". The coroner stole some of the money after gaining power of attorney for elderly people who had "lost their mental capacity". "[Crickmore] stole what he wanted when he wanted," said Det Ch Insp Sellwood. "He was propping up a lifestyle he couldn't afford - regular cruises, fine dining, various holidays, buying a house in the country. "By many standards that would be considered to be living quite a high lifestyle and he could only fund that lifestyle by stealing from his clients. "He was brought in to deal with probate and to wind up estates and, rather than give all of the monies to beneficiaries, he stole some of the monies from what would have been the beneficiaries." Councillor Will Windsor-Clive, from Gloucestershire County Council, said the case had been "really frustrating" while they waited for it to come to court. "While we run the coroner's service in the county, we don't employ the coroner and only the Lord Chancellor can dismiss him. As a result we've had no power to take action. "Mr Crickmore has offered his resignation and I hope we can now move forward." </body>

      <title>Hundreds more Madeleine calls</title>
      <description>Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have received more than 2,400 calls and emails since a BBC Crimewatch appeal on Monday.</description>

      <body>Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have received more than 2,400 calls and emails since an appeal on BBC's Crimewatch on Monday. Writing on Twitter, Det Ch Insp Andy Redwood said further appeals on similar programmes in the Netherlands and Germany had led to hundreds of calls. Madeleine, from Rothley, Leicestershire, was three when she disappeared in Portugal in May 2007. Det Ch Insp Redwood has said her abduction could have been pre-planned. Detectives released two e-fits of a man seen carrying a child in Praia da Luz at 22:00 on the night Madeleine went missing and it was revealed that they now suspected Madeleine could have been taken later than previously thought - just before her mother returned to the apartment to check on her. Following his appeal on Crimewatch, Det Ch Insp Redwood travelled to the Netherlands and Germany. Clickable map and timeline He tweeted on Thursday: ""Over 350 people have phoned into the studio of Opsporing Verzocht, Holland and 500 in Germany on Aktenzeichen XY. "Those enquiries are now being assessed and prioritised. Any deemed high being actioned." He added that the police were "very pleased" with the information they had been receiving. The next stage of the appeal will be in Ireland later this month. The Metropolitan Police are offering a £20,000 reward for information. Det Ch Insp Redwood told Crimewatch a number of men had been seen by witnesses in the area on the day Madeleine vanished and one theory was they could have been carrying out reconnaissance. He said they wanted to track down men seen "lurking suspiciously" near the McCanns' apartment. The Metropolitan Police say their inquiries have led to the new timeline and "accepted version of events" surrounding Madeleine's disappearance being significantly changed. The two e-fit images released are of a man a family had seen with a blond-haired child of three or four, possibly wearing pyjamas, heading away from the McCanns' holiday apartment. Det Ch Insp Redwood said he could be the man who took Madeleine - but there could be an innocent explanation. He also said there had been a four-fold increase in the number of burglaries in the area between January and May 2007 and one possible scenario was that Madeleine had disturbed a burglar. Police are also looking at possible bogus charity collectors operating in the area at the time and have released two e-fit images of Portuguese men they would like to identify. Police have also released e-fit images of two men seen in the area around the time that Madeleine disappeared. Two are of fair-haired men who fit similar descriptions. The Portuguese police shelved their inquiry in 2008, but Scotland Yard began a review of the case in May 2011 and opened a formal investigation in July this year. </body>

      <body>The owners of a care home in Lancashire are being prosecuted by the Health and Safety Executive after a resident choked to death on fish and chips. Rita Smith, 75, died after eating the meal at Euxton Park Care Home in Wigan Road, Chorley, on 1 December 2010. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said she had motor neurone disease and difficulty swallowing. Four Seasons Health Care Ltd, based in the Isle of Man, is due to appear before Preston magistrates on Friday. The company, which runs more than 500 care homes in the UK, is accused of breaching section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. The HSE said Ms Smith should have only eaten pureed food while supervised by a carer as she suffered from swallowing difficulties and was at risk of choking. However, the HSE said she was allegedly given fish and chips for her supper. </body>

      <description>The number of badgers culled during a six-week scheme in Gloucestershire has fallen short of its target, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson tells MPs.</description>

      <body>The number of badgers shot during a six-week cull in Gloucestershire has fallen short of its target, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has told MPs. Defra said 708 badgers had been killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Nigel Gibbens, chief veterinary officer, advised it should be extended. This could be for eight weeks. Badger campaigners have called the scheme a "massive failure" and said they would continue their protest . Mr Gibbens said extending the cull would achieve the "earliest and greatest possible impact" on bovine TB in Gloucestershire. Defra said Natural England was currently considering the application to extend the licence in Gloucestershire and a decision is "expected shortly". Mr Paterson told the BBC the cull figures were "not bad news" but admitted that those carrying out the killings had "got off to a slower start" in Gloucestershire. "We must remember that these are pilots," he said. "This has not been done before and we are learning, clearly, in each area. This isn't a sudden six-week period. These pilots are intended to go on for four years. "Up to to the end of July, a further 20,000 perfectly healthy cattle have been hauled off to slaughter at horrendous expense to the taxpayer because we've lost control of TB." Mr Paterson said 305,000 cattle had been "lost" over the past 10 years and it was "not acceptable" to allow the disease to go on. The badger cull in Gloucestershire ended this week. A licence was granted last week to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November. Defra said early indications from Gloucestershire are that, as in Somerset, the pilot had been "safe and humane". The government's original target was 2,900 badgers, based on a population estimate of 3,400 animals. The target was then revised to 1,650, from a population of 2,350. Last week Mr Paterson said the government was exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB. Stop the Badger Cull spokesman Jay Tiernan said the cull had been a "massive failure". "It's disgraceful," he said. "It clearly isn't safe, effective or humane. "It is time for someone to bite the bullet and admit it's been a failure." Mr Tiernan said protests against the culls would continue. </body>

      <title>Family fights 84-day disability rule</title>
      <description>A Warrington family is challenging a government rule which saw their disabled son's benefit taken away while he was in hospital.</description>

      <body>A family whose disabled son's benefit was taken away while he was in hospital, have challenged the government rule. Cameron Mathieson spent more than two years in Alder Hey Hospital with cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy. His family argue they acted as full-time carers until the five-year-old's death, in October 2012. Government guidelines state Disability Living Allowance (DLA) is not payable after the first 84 days in hospital. Cameron's father Craig, said they were challenging "this grossly unfair rule in Cameron's name" and plan to take the government to the Court of Appeal. He said: "Cameron had a unique combination of conditions and was the only such patient in the world with both cystic fibrosis and Duchenne's muscular dystrophy in the genetic combination he had. "While he was in hospital, my wife and I remained his primary caregivers and one of us stayed by his bedside at every waking moment, caring for him, nursing him, keeping him happy, bringing his brothers and sister to see him and play with him, giving medicines - far more than the hourly checks that he would have received on such a busy ward. "Abdicating Cameron's care to hospital staff during this time was simply not an option because they had made it clear to us how much they depended upon our input, yet after 84 days his DLA was suspended, along with Carer's Allowance and our National Insurance contributions, putting unbearable financial and emotional pressure on us as a family." Children's charities Contact a Family and Children's Trust are backing the Mathieson's challenge and have written to Esther McVey, Minister for Disabled People, about the issue. They have estimated there are up to 500 cases of children affected by this rule each year in the UK, with parents often staying with their child around the clock. Dalton Leong, chief executive of The Children's Trust, said: "Current DLA regulations mean that some of the UK's most severely disabled and sick children are being denied financial assistance at a time when they need it most. "Removing DLA from a child, leads to the parents losing their Carer's Allowance and in some cases other benefits. This can prove financially devastating for families with severely disabled children who are often in and out of hospital. "We urge the Government to stand by its commitment to protect the most disabled, by abolishing this rule." A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: "DLA is paid to help people who are unable to walk or virtually unable to walk or do things like wash and dress themselves. "After a child is looked after free of charge in hospital for nearly three months we put payment of their DLA on hold because their needs are already being met by the NHS. "Children receive DLA payments for longer [than over 16s] after being admitted to hospital, because we recognise they need longer to adjust." </body>

      <description>Exam results for an entire year group at a Lincoln school are thrown out after allegations of "false marking".</description>

      <body>Exam results for an entire year at a Lincoln school have been thrown out amid concerns over "false marking". Manor Leas Junior Academy's Sats results from the summer were annulled by the Department for Education (DfE). It followed an investigation by the Standards and Testing Agency (STA) prompted when one exam paper too many was submitted for marking. Head James Greenwood said pupils' education was not affected and teacher assessments reflected their progress. The problem arose when an external marker for the school's Sats flagged up an extra exam paper. When the school could not account for the paper, Mr Greenwood referred the matter to the STA which investigated. A spokesman for the DfE said the STA found "maladministration" and took the standard step of annulling all the Year 6 results. "We take any allegation of false marking very seriously," he added "Following an investigation, the Standards and Testing Agency annulled the results of the maths and grammar, punctuation and spelling Key Stage 2 tests at Manor Leas." The school has not been inspected since converting to an academy but was ranked good overall by Ofsted last year. In a statement, Mr Greenwood said the problem was down to an "internal staffing issue". "The incident was dealt with robustly and professionally with the exam board in line with school policies," he said. "I have been advised that I cannot discuss discipline issues due to legal reasons and confidentiality." He added: "I wish to make it clear that the education of the pupils at Manor Leas Junior Academy has not been affected and we will continue to provide excellent standards of teaching and learning." Because the school's results were annulled, it will mean no pupils achieve level four in their Sats, the measure used in the league table. Schools are expected to get the majority of children to level four by the end of Key Stage 2. It also means the children have no formal measure of their progress to take to secondary school. One parent, who did not wish to be named, said she did not have a lot of faith in the system. "I got a letter about three weeks ago saying that the marks had changed and they were unable to give a specific grade," she said. </body>

      <body>A man whose Halloween display included a disembowelled corpse has been told to "tone it down" after police received a report it was upsetting children. James Creighton put the fake corpse and other items in his garden on Grove Road, Stevenage to raise money for a cancer charity. He said he thought police were "joking" when they told him of the concerns. Hertfordshire Police said he had been asked to change the display as "people were being distressed by it". A spokesman for the force said the corpse was "very realistic and if people have concerns, we have to address them". Mr Creighton said he had shown his corpses and skeletons every year since 2009 and had never had a complaint. He said he was a "huge" Halloween fan and started the "gored-up" shows shortly after his grandmother died of cancer to raise money for Cancer Research UK. He said he thought the officers who came to his house on Tuesday "must be joking" when they told him of the concerns. "I thought it was a ridiculous waste of police time. "If someone was worried, they could have told me and I would have made some sort of compromise." Mr Creighton said the officers had asked him to "lose a few bits" and "put a tarpaulin up, but then people wouldn't be able to see it and I do this to raise money". He added that he had removed some items following the visit, but had since put them back. Insp Simon Tabert said officers had visited Mr Creighton "to discuss the matter". "We had a complaint [from a parent] that it was so realistic, it was going to upset their children," he said. "Mr Creighton offered to create a barrier, but it's my understanding we did not ask him to do so. "We asked him to tone it down, because people were being distressed by it." </body>

      <body>The owners of a shop that sells legal highs have defended their firm after a 17-year-old suffered a near-fatal reaction to a product they sold. Matt Ford had to be treated in hospital after he smoked incense called Exodus Damnation, from Skunkworks in Canterbury. In a letter to Conservative MP Julian Brazier, a Skunkworks spokesman said it boasted "extremely high moral codes". Mr Brazier wrote to the home secretary calling for the store to be shut down. In its letter, UK Skunkworks said: "The paraphernalia that we sell is not for drug use, we sell a wide range of popular products that are received very well by an adult market. "The online industry of products we sell is extensive, however up until now the regulation of the products has been impossible. "Our stores operate a number of strict policies and are enforced by a large team. "These policies ensure that young people under the age of 18 can not enter our stores whatsoever." It reiterates that it took disciplinary action after Matt, a student at Canterbury College, managed to buy Exodus Damnation from one of its stores. The letter ends: "Calling for UK Skunkworks to be shut down is a pitiful attempt at dealing with the issues we face. "I think you again fail to understand that we trade legally and take our business very seriously. If you wish to meet with us I think you will find us most accommodating and open minded." In his letter to Theresa May, Mr Brazier, who represents Canterbury and Whitstable, called for Skunkworks and "its fellow shops and its websites" to be banned. He said Skunkworks' get-out clause over the substances for sale at its shop was they were "not for human consumption", but its advice was to "help you relax" by burning the herbs in the home. Legal highs mimic the effects of illegal drugs, but are not banned under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Home Office minister and MP for Lewes in East Sussex, Norman Baker said: "We do take action within weeks to ban particular substances. "I have asked officials to look at this particular one in the light of the incident which you've drawn my attention to, and I expect a swift reply on it." </body>

      <body>A police officer who shot dead a man eight years ago has been refused permission to appeal against an inquiry which found there was "no lawful justification" for his actions. The officer, known as E7, killed Azelle Rodney in Edgware in 2005 after the car he was in was stopped by armed police. E7 said he opened fire because he believed Mr Rodney had picked up a gun. But the inquiry ruled E7 "could not rationally have believed" Mr Rodney was holding a sub-machine gun. E7 was seeking a declaration that the inquiry's conclusions relating to his use of force were "irrational", or an order quashing parts of the report which found his use of force was unjustified. In refusing the judicial review, Mr Justice Wyn Williams said he had "no doubt" there was "ample evidence to justify the finding" the officer did not have an honest belief that Mr Rodney had picked up the gun. The inquiry considered issues including what information the police had, how reliable it was, whether their approach minimised the risk to life and if stopping the car was done with only necessary force. Sir Christopher Holland, who carried out the independent investigation, said in his conclusions: "There was no lawful justification for shooting Azelle Rodney so as to kill him. "E7's accounts of what he saw are not to be accepted. "Prior to firing he did not believe that the man who turned out to be Azelle Rodney had picked up a gun and was about to use it. "Further, on the basis of what he was able to see, he could not rationally have believed that." E7 told the inquiry he saw Mr Rodney start moving around, reaching down and then coming back up with his shoulders hunched. Mr Rodney was then shot six times, once each in the arm and back, and four times in the head. </body>

      <title>FA supports Hodgson over 'joke'</title>
      <description>The Football Association says England boss Roy Hodgson has its full support after claims he made an offensive joke.</description>

      <body>The Football Association has given its "full support" to Roy Hodgson after claims a comment made in a team-talk by the England manager caused offence. Hodgson was criticised for referring to a joke about a monkey and an astronaut at half-time in Tuesday's World Cup qualifier against Poland. "He has and deserves the full support of the Football Association," FA chairman Greg Dyke said. Anti-racism campaigners Kick It Out praised the FA's "swift" response. It had called for an investigation into Hodgson's comments but, after the FA confirmed it had not received any complaints from the England players, it now considered the matter closed. A Kick It Out statement read: "We are pleased that the Football Association has investigated this matter swiftly and issued its findings immediately. "If there has been no complaint on the back of the investigation then the matter can only be deemed as concluded. "Kick It Out acts on behalf of the football community at large and when an allegation of a racist or discriminatory nature is made, it's the organisation's role to follow this up." Hodgson was reported  to have referenced the joke when trying to explain to right-back Chris Smalling that he needed to pass the ball to winger Andros Townsend more. The joke, the exact wording of which is still unclear, revolves around an astronaut and a monkey on a Nasa mission. The monkey performs all the tasks requested by mission control, with the punchline being that the astronaut's only role is to feed the monkey. The England manager later apologised and Townsend, 22, tweeted:  "I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken!" Dyke added: "Roy Hodgson is a man of the highest integrity, an honourable man who is doing a great job with the England team. "He has fully explained to us what he said and the point he was making to the players in the dressing room at half-time on Tuesday night. He has also explained the context in which he made his remarks. "He has made clear there was no intent to say anything inappropriate, and he was certainly not making any comments with any racist connotation. Importantly, he has apologised for any unintended offence that may have been taken. "We will be making no further comment on this story and will now be giving Roy and the team our full support as we prepare for the World Cup in Brazil." England striker Wayne Rooney also showed his support for 66-year-old Hodgson on Twitter,  and via his personal website:  "To be honest it's really annoying that something such as this should see the light of day. "All the lads know what type of guy Roy is, and to try and pin some form of label on him is absolutely ridiculous. Roy spoke to Andros straight away, and he took no offence whatsoever. Hopefully that's now the end of the matter." Former England striker Stan Collymore, 42, also defended the former Fulham and West Brom boss on Twitter,  suggesting the row undermines moves to eradicate racism from the sport. "Demeans every anti-racism campaigner by having cheap pop at RH [Roy Hodgson] who said nothing wrong. Makes campaigners seem over-PC and petty. They're not," he said. However, Piara Powar, executive director of Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare), told the BBC that Hodgson had got it wrong. "This was a silly phrase to use in a diverse workforce," said Powar. "I think some players will see it as a reflection of the type of language still used by some coaches and some attitudes that still prevail." </body>

      <body>Drunk students who brought Newcastle city centre to a standstill while singing and dancing along to a cult football chant have been criticised by Northumbria Police. Footage of dozens of people joining in a song praising brothers Yaya and Kolo Toure was posted online. Collingwood Street was blocked for several minutes at 03:00 BST on Wednesday, police said. The chant uses the tune of 2 Unlimited's 1993 single, No Limit. It originated from the time both players were at Manchester City. Kolo now plays for Liverpool. It is thought the chanting was started by a Chelsea-supporting friend of a Manchester City fan. The outbreak of dancing came to the attention of Yaya who tweeted his thanks to those who joined in. Police said the "rowdy" behaviour could have resulted in injuries. Central neighbourhood inspector Caroline Ord said: "This type of drunken and disorderly behaviour will not be tolerated by police in Newcastle city centre. "We want young people to come into the city centre and have a good time but they must behave responsibly." </body>

      <body>A former BBC radio presenter described as a "dominant predator" has been found guilty of sexually abusing boys. Ex-BBC Radio Norfolk and Radio Clyde broadcaster Michael Souter, 60, was convicted of 19 sexual assaults on seven boys aged between 11 and 16 after a six-week trial at Norwich Crown Court. During his trial it was questioned whether the authorities could have done more to stop the abuse. In 1991 Norfolk County Council allowed Souter to adopt. Norfolk Social Services spokeswoman Sheila Lock said all the appropriate checks had been done on the "devious" abuser. Three years later he was arrested and the adoption terminated though no criminal action was taken. Chris McCann, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said because there was no file relating to that period, he was not in a position to say whether or not CPS or the police could have "done something different" in 1993.

      <description>Why did it go so wrong at Al-Madinah free school?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24569961</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70548000/jpg/_70548135_madinah.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Described as "dysfunctional" and "in chaos", there can be no doubt that the problems at the Al-Madinah School go right to its core. Rated inadequate in all four inspection areas, Ofsted said problems at the Derby school were "myriad". Not only does it lack the basic structures needed to operate, it is said to be close to "collapsing". Al-Madinah is the second free school to be put into special measures, after Discovery Free School in May 2013. A further five out of the 24 inspected so far have been labelled "requiring improvement" - the next worse category. But then it is only two years into the programme. Across England the latest Ofsted figures show that 2% of state schools are in special measures - 383 out of 21,186 inspections. But no up-and-running free school has unravelled quite so publicly as this Derby-based Muslim faith school. It started with claims about female staff being required to wear hijabs, Islamic headscarves, but the focus has shifted to the "unacceptable" level of education the government and inspectors now say it is providing. The key thing that makes this Ofsted report stand out, is the fact that the findings come just a year after the school opened. Most schools that deteriorate tend to do so over a much longer period of time. And many of the problems it highlights seem to have implications for the particular nature of free schools and the extra freedoms they are allowed. The report's second line says: "This is a school which has been set up and run by representatives of the community with limited knowledge and experience." Education Secretary Michal Gove argued that taking schools out of the hands of bureaucrats would liberate innovators to push up standards through reform and experimentation. But the Ofsted findings in this case reflect exactly what detractors of such DIY school projects feared would happen. They asked how people who knew little about education could set up and run something so complex and important as a school. In addition, teaching, which the government sees as the most important engine raising attainment, was found to be "inadequate". "Many teachers are inexperienced and have not received the training and support they need," the Ofsted report said. This seems to highlight one of the most fundamental differences between free schools and regular state schools - there is no obligation to employ qualified teachers in England's free schools. The Department for Education argued that it gave free schools this freedom, which exists amongst independent schools, to enable them to employ industry experts. But this does not appear to have worked in the pupils' favour in the Al-Madinah case. The Ofsted report said: "Almost all teaching seen during the inspection, including in the Early Years Foundation Stage, was judged inadequate." It added that most teaching and lessons in the primary school were poorly planned and that teachers did not know how to use pupils' assessments to plan lessons and set work. Questions are now being asked about how the Department for Education could approve a school for opening one year, only for it to be found to lack the "basic systems" it needs to operate 12 months later. Were the checks necessary for ensuring the school would be fit for purpose undertaken in a sufficiently rigorous way? Judging from the pre-registration report undertaken by Ofsted in the July before it opened, no assessment was made by the inspectorate of the school's ability to educate pupils. But Ofsted did wave the red flag at this stage over child protection measures, saying that four regulations had not yet been met and that staff needed to undertake training on such issues. This was highlighted by shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt in an emergency question in the Commons. The DfE has insisted that it took all necessary steps to ensure the school was fit for purpose when it opened in September 2012. It said: "Ofsted recommended Al-Madinah should be registered as long as four requirements were met. "Ofsted often sets out a number of requirements it wants to see before new schools can open. In this case, [Al-Madinah Education Trust] provided the necessary evidence to show that these requirements were met." But the report also said the school had "not been adequately monitored or supported". Prime Minister David Cameron has taken to local radio to say that the school should close if it does not take immediate action to put things right. But he also said that this particular case should not be used as a "stick to beat the whole free school movement" as these were delivering a better standard of education than most state schools. He quoted figures hailed by the DfE earlier in the year which said three-quarters of the first free schools were rated good or outstanding - which a spokesman pointed out was a significantly higher proportion than all state schools. But Mr Hunt said the education of children in Derby was being sacrificed for ideology. He added: "It's not just the Al-Madinah School which is dysfunctional, it's the education secretary's free school policy." </body>

The narrative of fatal knife crime is usually a simple one. A person is killed, the grieving family releases a tribute, the case goes to court and the person responsible is imprisoned. The police will then release a statement on behalf of the family in which the detectives are thanked for their help in securing justice. Some people might even use the word "closure". And that, appeals not withstanding, is that. Only it never is like that. The real impact of violent deaths on surviving families is rarely told. It does not fit the prescribed narrative with its neat beginnings, middles and endings. Mood swings, addiction, the loss of toenails and hair, suicide attempts, marital collapse, alienation from friends and difficulties with eating - the physical and social effects of bereavement are less reported. The after-effects of knife crime on the bereaved can resemble the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) experienced by post-combat soldiers, psychologists say. This is something Anne Oakes-Odger knows all too well. Her son Westley Odger, 27, was stabbed in the neck outside a cash machine in Colchester in 2005. He died of his injuries. The "reason" for the attack was that he told someone not to jump the queue. Ms Oakes-Odger, who lives in Essex, believes the psychological and physical impact of murder on surviving family members is poorly understood. "You feel as though you are losing your mind," she says. "When a child is murdered, it is out of the normal course of events. "The shock element creates a lot of physical and mental issues for every member of the family. "One of the things which happened to me was my hair fell out in bunches and my toenails fell off. I thought that was peculiar to me, but I found out it wasn't." The loss of her hair and nails was, she says, a symptom of the stress of living in a sustained "flight or fight" state. She also suffered colour blindness. "During the early years I was not seeing things in colour. I could only see in black and white and various shades of grey. "There isn't a 'closure' with homicide." The criminal justice system itself hinders rather than helps, according to Ms Oakes-Odger. For months or years after a murder, the loved one is more "evidence" than person, and can be subjected to multiple post mortem examinations. And at the centre of proceedings sits not the victim, or their family, but the accused. Grieving while the wheels of justice roll, she says, is nigh on impossible. And by the time they do stop, the psychological damage is already done. The Ministry of Justice says it understands the "immeasurable suffering" experienced by victims' families and that it is committed to making sure more support than "ever before" is available to them. This includes the national Homicide Service, which offers such families a Victim Support caseworker and access to specialist counselling. The department is also "revamping" the Victim's Code which it says will make "major improvements for victims" and give them a clearer guide about their entitlements and sources of help. These are the type of measures Tanya (pictured above), who asked for her surname to be withheld, says she desperately needed. Her husband Gary, 59, was murdered by their son Ed who, after killing his father upstairs with a hammer and a knife, came downstairs and tried to kill her. She heard two "thuds" upstairs and believes had she not turned around to see her son before he attacked she too would have died. The killing happened a week before Christmas in 2007. The family had enjoyed a normal day and Ed had been upstairs in his room. He asked Gary to come up and help him fix his stereo. It was then that he killed him. Her son, who was 15 at the time, is serving 18 years for murder and attempted murder. He had denied the charges, claiming his state of mind was altered by the anti-depressant fluoxetine. "I lost everything that day," she says. Like Ms Oakes-Odger, Tanya's toenails fell out. Even now, six years on, she still loses her nails when she is under stress. After her husband's murder, the former nursery worker could not bring herself to use knives - even cutlery knives - or face opening her post. Looking back, Tanya says there is precious little support offered to the families of people violently killed. The attention and support, she says, goes to the perpetrators. The victims' families, Tanya says, are - with the exception of police family liaison officers - left to find their own way through the emotional and practical debris of a disaster. "There was nothing," she says. "And it takes so much for you to ask for help. And you just don't have the words. It would be much better if support was offered to you, even if you didn't take it there and then, but could take it along the way. "My two other children (who were in their late teens when their father was murdered by their brother) had no support." Also difficult has been the expectations wider society places on the families. "It has been five years but I still have days when it is hard - anniversaries. Some people are really good and know when you're not in the right place. Others say 'you're OK' and they expect you to be OK and so for those people, you are. "I still have times when I have to put the knives away and when people are doing DIY with hammers... but it is part of everyday life, and you have to get used to it." For some, deaths can trigger a personal redefinition. A shy person learns to speak out, for example. Take Holly Watson. Now aged 20, she met her half-brother Lewis when she was 14. Just two years after they met, Lewis was dead. The 23-year-old was stabbed three times in Sudbury, Suffolk. The only photograph she has of Lewis, who was a keen angler, is of him holding a fish. She never got to say goodbye as he was dead before she got to hospital. "That was hard," she says. "I had never seen a dead body before. And when the first body you see is your big brother, well that's hard to deal with. "I became a bit of a recluse. At the beginning I hated the world and everybody in it. "It was almost like a hysteria, with Lewis dying, the funeral and the waiting, like limbo land, and then the court case and then everybody said it would get easier with the closure, but it doesn't." Immediately after her brother's death, she was unable to pick up a cutlery knife. "To begin with knives made me feel sick, I couldn't use them. We felt we could not hold something that had killed Lewis." Then there was the impact on her ambitions. Holly had always wanted to be a lawyer. But as she started to explore the law, she found many of the scenarios put to students in law exams involved knife crimes. Her ambitions for the law were put on hold. Next year she will turn 21. It is not an anniversary she is looking forward to. Her brother, she says, should be there for it. And should she ever marry, then Lewis should have been there for that too. But he won't be. "I dread the day when I have children and I have to tell them that their uncle isn't here," she says. "The biggest thing in getting over something like this is in accepting that the world is not always what you want it to be." Holly says she used to be shy. She is now an anti-knife violence campaigner. So too is Caroline Shearer. Her 17-year-old son Jay Whiston was fatally stabbed in the heart outside a house party in Essex last September. Exactly what happened remains unclear and is currently subject to court proceedings. Ms Shearer describes the days since her son's death as a "living torture" peppered only by the briefest of moments each morning, in the gap between sleep and consciousness, when the anguish of loss is kept at bay. She would love to have all of the happy memories she shared with Jay at the forefront of her mind. Instead, the recurring image which haunts her is of her boy on the cusp of adulthood lying dead on a mortuary slab. "I was a mother of two children then, within three hours, I was a mother of one," she says. "He was a normal, everyday, loving, caring boy. I always say he had such a huge heart, they couldn't have missed." The grief she describes is like a sledgehammer. There are gaps in the day when she might, for example, notice the weather, or have a conversation. And then the grief hits her, again and again. It is with her throughout the day - as she washes clothes, cooks meals or sees a car of the same colour as Jay's - and last thing at night as she falls asleep. And she too had difficulties with eating. She tells how shortly after Jay's death she struggled to use kitchen knives or cutlery - because of their association with the implement used to kill her son. None of the symptoms reported by the families surprise clinical psychologist Don Macleod. Mr Macleod has worked with families across the north west of England who have suffered tragedy. Some suffer PTSD symptoms more often associated with combat veterans. But for the families, he says, the expert knowledge needed to help them is often not there. "I would be almost certain that your average GP would not actually tag what's going on with someone having that kind of reaction," says Mr Macleod. "The GP might know there had been a murder in the family, but they might not have the time or indeed the skills and knowledge to be able to pinpoint that [PTSD] is what the issue is." Part of the issue is that the initial responses to grief - anger, anxiety, flashbacks and depression - are, although extremely unpleasant for the people suffering them, "completely normal" given the circumstances. They become an issue, he said, when they "become protracted" - such as with PTSD. Can these families ever recover? Ms Oakes-Odger thinks they can, but it is a slow, painful process which results not in a return to how things used to be but in acceptance of the way they are now. "It is about finding a new 'normal'," she says, "a normal in which you can lead a purposeful life, one you can go forward with." </body>

      <title>Trafficking: why is help refused?</title>
      <description>Why are victims of human trafficking reluctant to seek help?</description>

      <body>In a series of raids on suspected illegal brothels in Birmingham West Midlands Police took five women into protective custody. They are thought have been brought into the UK by traffickers, but why have all the women refused counselling? The phrase 'Stockholm Syndrome' is usually reserved for hostages who in some cases form a powerful, emotional attachment to their captors. But the charities tackling human trafficking say that a number of victims of the trafficking gangs are suffering from symptoms of the Syndrome that was first coined in the 1970s following a bank siege in the Swedish capital. Despite the more obvious reason such as the fear of reprisals from those who enslaved them, West Midlands Police say there are many reasons why victims stay silent. "Victims are exploited in four main ways - forced labour, sexual exploitation, domestic servitude and benefit fraud. Those who traffic people may do so by force or coercion," said Det Supt Tim Bacon. "They either do not see themselves as victims, or they may have a suspicion of authorities and a lack of awareness that (authorities) are in a position to help. They also fear traffickers will accuse them of being complicit in their trafficked situation. "Often, there can be a type of Stockholm Syndrome - where due to unequal power, victims create a false emotional or psychological attachment to their controller." Stop The Traffik is a London-based group that works to create and change awareness of the problem. A spokeswoman said: "A lot of women have been groomed into their situation, so there is a huge sense of loyalty to their captors. "For many, it can be the first relationship they have ever had; they have no other frame of reference, and are working for this person 12 hours a day, seven days a week. "But the after-care system for UK victims is not great. "Drop-in venues are available for women who work on the street, but for trafficking victims, behind closed doors, there is none." One trafficking victim who did seek help - and now advises others to do the same - is Svetlana. Free from the abuse of her ordeal, she has used the help and support available to rebuild her life - and now offers that support to others. She said: "At a party when I was 18, a man approached me and started yelling and punching me, saying he was going to take me away. "I was forced into a vehicle and told someone would meet me at the other end. This was in London. "I was forced to take drugs and pictures were taken of me; and that is when I first got a clue what was happening to me. I was forced to work as a prostitute. "Later I was sold to another man for £6,000 and told I would have to work that cost off through prostitution." Despite a fear of her captors, Svetlana plotted her escape at a service station, where she "plucked up the courage" to ask staff for help. She was put in touch with police and the Salvation Army, who work around-the-clock internationally to help identify and support trafficking victims. Major Anne Read, Salvation Army anti-trafficking response co-ordinator, said: "We have the government contract for managing the support for all UK adult trafficking victims. "That means when a victim is rescued, or escapes, they are referred to us to see if they need or want help with medical, legal, or accommodation matters." Friday is Anti-Slavery Day and will see the Salvation Army holding a range of UK-wide events to raise even more awareness of the issue. But for now, the daily nightmare of human trafficking continues for hundreds of powerless victims. </body>

      <title>Great Escape prisoner of war dies</title>
      <description>Great Escape tunnel digger dies at the age of 91</description>

      <body>One of the few remaining survivors of a German prisoner of war camp immortalised in the film The Great Escape has died. Frank Stone, who died aged 91, was taken to Stalag Luft III in Zagan after his bomber crashed in Germany in 1940. The 18-year-old RAF gunner was housed in hut 104, home to 76 airmen who attempted escape via a tunnel in 1944. However, the alarm was raised before Mr Stone, who had helped dispose of soil from the tunnel, could join them. During an interview with the BBC in 2009, Mr Stone, of Hathersage, Derbyshire, said the atmosphere on the night of the escape had been "electric". "It was all very tense - but at 5 o'clock, a shot rang out and we knew they had been discovered." Of the 76 who made their break for freedom using the tunnel, known as Harry, 50 were subsequently shot after being recaptured and only three men managed to get away successfully. Mr Stone said: "It was very sad and we were advised not to make any further attempts to escape." He was finally freed towards the end of the war. His widow, Jane, said: "He gave lots of talks about the escape and always said he was doing it in memory of those 50. "Frank could never understand why people where so interested in him but they were. We often had to put extra talks on so more people could come." Stalag Luft III, which was 100 miles south-east of Berlin, held about 10,000 RAF crew at the height of its occupation. In 1947, 18 soldiers who shot those who were recaptured were put before a military tribunal in Hamburg. Thirteen of them were executed, while the rest received long prison sentences. The story of the escape was made into a film in 1963, starring Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and Donald Pleasence. </body>
