      <body>Former prime minister Sir John Major has called for an emergency tax on the profits of the UK's top energy firms. The ex-Conservative leader said recent price rises of more than 10% were "unacceptable" and action was needed. The government could claw back the cost of extra winter fuel payments through a one-off tax, he suggested. Downing Street said there was no such plan but called Sir John's comments "interesting". Energy firms said they were helping customers keep bills down. Ministers have rejected a call by Labour leader Ed Miliband for a price freeze, describing it as a "con" and urging hard-pressed consumers to switch suppliers instead. Three of the "big six" energy firms - Npower, SSE, and British Gas - have announced plans to raise gas and electricity bills by between 8% and 10%. Analysts expect the others - Scottish Power, E.On and EDF - to follow suit with similar price increases. Speaking at a lunch for political journalists, Sir John - prime minister between 1990 and 1997 - said price rises of this kind were not justified and it would be "entirely reasonable" for the government to impose a one-off levy to recover the cost of cold weather payments this winter. Cold weather payments are triggered when the temperature falls below a certain level for a prolonged period. Those on income support and other work-related benefits are eligible for a £25 payment if temperatures drop to zero degrees Celsius or below for seven consecutive days. Fuel poverty campaigners have said the price rises will leave some people with the choice of having to "heat or eat" this winter but energy firms say they are needed to cover the cost of rising wholesale prices and environmental obligations. Asked about Labour's plan for price freeze if it is elected in 2015, Sir John said "Ed Miliband's heart was in the right place but his head has gone walkabout", adding that the plan was unworkable. "But he did touch on an issue that's very important. The private sector is something the Conservative party support but when the private sector goes wrong or behaves badly I think it is entirely right to make changes and put it right. "At the moment I do not see how it can be in any way acceptable that with energy prices rising broadly 4% in terms of costs that the price to the consumer should rise by the 9-10% that we are hearing." He later told the BBC that the was a "crisis" in the energy market and there was a "very real chance" that the government would have to increase the amount of assistance it gave to people in the event of cold snap. Should this happen, he said a "one-off retrospective" tax should be considered "given the scale of their (energy firms') profits and the unjustified nature of the price increases they have just proposed". The BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said the prime minister and his chancellor were instinctively opposed to short-term fixes and believed only action on competition and supply would reduce bills. But he said intervention from such a senior figure would increase pressure on them to do something. In response to the ex-PM's comments, Ed Miliband tweeted: "Sir John Major makes Labour's argument: David Cameron stands up for the energy companies not hard-pressed families." Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint said the former PM was "joining a chorus of voices who are concerned about the way the public has been left out of pocket". But she said Labour opposed a windfall tax, as it would be complicated and it was unclear how it would benefit consumers, while a price freeze was a "simple measure" to give consumers immediate respite. The government has said the price rises are "disappointing" but has insisted a price freeze could actually lead to higher prices in the long-term and what is needed is more competition. "There are a number of initiatives that the government has to support vulnerable people, such as the cold weather payments," a No 10 spokesman said. "We have a range of ways in which support is given and those are the right ones." Conservative business minister Michael Fallon said: "It's an interesting idea but we think a faster way to bear down on prices is more competition, simpler tariffs and making it much easier for people to switch to a cheaper supplier." The Energy UK trade association said: "No one should be afraid to put the heating on this winter. If customers are worried they should get in touch with their energy supplier and they should be able to help. "The energy industry is doing an increasing amount to help vulnerable customers and we will be looking at what more can be done to help people worried about their bills." The bosses of the leading energy firms have been called to appear before MPs next week to explain the price rises. Earlier on Tuesday, Scottish Power was told to pay £8.5m to many of its customers after being found to have misled them about the benefits of switching to alternative suppliers and other breaches of its licence obligations. More than 140,000 customers on the warm homes discount schemes, designed to support those at risk of fuel poverty, will receive about £50 in compensation each. </body>

      <title>Facebook adds alerts to death clips</title>
      <description>Facebook adds warning signs to videos of beheadings and other instances of graphic violence, but its safety advisors still have concerns.</description>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70637000/jpg/_70637328_facebook.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Facebook has begun adding warning messages to videos on its site showing decapitations and other instances of extreme violence. The alert states: "Warning! This video contains extremely graphic content and may be upsetting." The move follows its decision to allow the clips to be posted to its site following a temporary ban on the material, introduced in May. The prime minister and Facebook's own advisors had criticised the decision. The social network said that it wished to allow its users - who can be as young as 13 - to share and condemn the material. It added that it would continue to block clips if the original poster glorified or celebrated the violence shown. On Monday the firm said it might, in time, add warnings or other controls, but initially allowed a recently uploaded decapitation clip to appear unaltered. This prompted David Cameron to tweet: "It's irresponsible of Facebook to post beheading videos, especially without a warning. They must explain their actions to worried parents." US charity the Family Online Safety Institute - a member of the social network's Safety Advisory Board - also raised concern saying it had not been alerted to the change of policy despite previously stating such videos "crossed the line". A spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment about its latest move. She had previously defended its decision to allow a video showing a woman being beheaded - believed to have been filmed in Mexico - to be shared despite the fact it bans images and videos showing a woman's "fully exposed breast". "Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences, particularly when they're connected to controversial events on the ground, such as human rights abuses, acts of terrorism and other violent events," she said. "People are sharing this video on Facebook to condemn it. If the video were being celebrated, or the actions in it encouraged, our approach would be different." A UK member of Facebook's Safety Advisory Board said he still had concerns despite the addition of the warnings. "It's a step forward but it's still horrific content," said Will Gardner, chief executive of Childnet. He added that he needed to look into the changes before commenting further. Until Monday Facebook had also featured adverts alongside the video of the Mexican murder despite the fact several users had complained to it about the material. Car-sharing firm Zipcar, whose service was one of those shown, said it was disappointed by the discovery. "We want you to know that we do not condone this type of abhorrent content being circulated on Facebook," it said in a statement. "We have expressed to Facebook in the past the critical need to block offensive content from appearing and we will continue to engage with them on this important matter." Facebook has since disabled Zipcar and other firms' ads from appearing on the page in question. One of the Facebook accounts that had requested the death video be removed belongs to the South Australia Police force (Sapol). It said it had been contacted by a member of its local community about the matter. Shelaye Boothey, director of Sapol's media and public engagement section, told the BBC: "Ultimately this is a decision that Facebook is entitled to make, however anyone concerned with the publishing of the video should continue to express their concerns through the appropriate Facebook channels." Hostage UK - a charity that supports kidnap victims and their families - added that it was also urging Facebook to reconsider its decision. "We know first-hand the acute distress these videos and images cause and we stress that this continues to be a source of worry to the families of today's hostages," it said. "We can see no useful purpose being served by the decision to make such recordings available. The public are well aware of the brutalities committed and a public showing of such material adds nothing, other than cause further unimaginable suffering." However, some freedom of speech campaigners believe that Facebook should not block the videos, even if they do celebrate the violence contained. French digital rights group La Quadrature Du Net described the actions as "privatised censorship". "It plays a profoundly anti-democratic role when it makes any such choice, whatever the limits are and whatever the good reasons it uses to make the decision," said the organisation's co-founder Jeremie Zimmermann. </body>

      <title>Why Beckham had to go - Ferguson</title>
      <description>Sir Alex Ferguson, in his latest autobiography, says David Beckham had to leave Manchester United as he thought he was "bigger than the manager".</description>

      <body>Sir Alex Ferguson says David Beckham had to leave Manchester United because the former England captain thought he was "bigger than the manager". In his latest autobiography, Ferguson said he fell out with Beckham after criticising his performance during an FA Cup defeat by Arsenal in 2003. "The minute a Manchester United player thought he was bigger than the manager, he had to go," he wrote. "David thought he was bigger than Alex Ferguson. "That was the death knell for him." Ferguson also said he had concerns about Beckham's celebrity lifestyle, following the player's marriage to Victoria Adams, a member of the pop group the Spice Girls. "David was the only player I managed who chose to be famous, who made it his mission to be known outside the game," wrote Ferguson. "I felt uncomfortable with the celebrity aspect of his life." In a press conference on Tuesday to launch his book, Ferguson added: "He fell in love with Victoria - that changed everything." But he also praised Beckham for his contribution to United's success and called him an "icon to every kid in the world". Beckham, who won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups and one Champions League crown during his United career, was eventually sold to Real Madrid for £25m in the summer of 2003, before moving to the United States to play for LA Galaxy. As for Ferguson, he brought his career as United boss to a close in May, ending one of the most successful managerial reigns in British history. During his 26 years in charge at Old Trafford, he won 38 trophies and managed some of the biggest names in football, like Beckham, Eric Cantona, Cristiano Ronaldo, Peter Schmeichel, Bryan Robson, Roy Keane, Jaap Stam and Ruud Van Nistelrooy. Ferguson also writes in 'Alex Ferguson: My Autobiography' that: Ferguson also describes in detail his version of the dressing-room bust-up with Beckham that followed the FA Cup loss to Arsenal. "He was around 12 feet from me," wrote Ferguson. "David swore. I moved towards him and, as I approached, I kicked a boot. It hit him right above the eye. "Of course, he rose to have a go at me and the players stopped him. 'Sit down,' I said. 'You've let your team down. You can argue as much as you like.' "I called him in the next day to go through the video and he still would not accept his mistake. "The next day the story was in the press. It was in those days that I told the board David had to go." After helping Real Madrid win La Liga, Beckham moved to the United States in 2007, guiding LA Galaxy to victory in the MLS Cup. "I imagine he also had his eyes on Hollywood and the impact it would have on the next phase of his career," Ferguson added. "There was no footballing reason to go to America." Keane was another player who Ferguson decided was no longer wanted at Old Trafford. The Scot describes how his relationship deteriorated with the Republic of Ireland midfielder, to the point that he became a negative influence. "With Roy, there were episodes of great friction and drama as he tried to impose his will on the team," wrote Ferguson. "On one occasion, as I came in to the dressing room, Roy and Ruud van Nistelrooy were at it, hammer and tongs. They had to be pulled apart by the players." Keane left United in November 2005, just a few weeks after angering Ferguson for criticising team-mates in an interview for MUTV. Ferguson also allowed Ronaldo to leave Old Trafford in 2009, but only after Real Madrid had agreed to pay £80m for the winger. "Cristiano was the most gifted player I managed," wrote Ferguson. "He surpassed all the other great ones I coached at United - and I had many." Ronaldo had wanted to move to Real Madrid the previous summer, but Ferguson blocked a potential transfer because he was unhappy with the way Real president Ramon Calderon had behaved. Ferguson told Ronaldo he would rather "shoot" him than sell him to Real, claiming he would lose his "honour" if he agreed to a sale. However, the Scot promised to let the player leave the following year, which he did when Madrid made a world record bid. Ferguson, whose trophy haul at United includes 13 league titles, two Champions League crowns, five FA Cups and four League Cups, decided to quit as manager in May and was replaced by David Moyes. Under Moyes, who left Everton to take the Old Trafford job, the defending Premier League champions have made their worst league start in 24 years and lie eighth in the table, eight points adrift of leaders Arsenal. </body>

      <title>'Go home' vans not good idea - May</title>
      <description>Vans telling illegal immigrants to "go home" or face arrest will not be rolled out across the UK, Home Secretary Theresa May says.</description>

      <body>Theresa May has said vans telling illegal immigrants to "go home" or face arrest will not be rolled out across the UK. A trial of the controversial vans in London is still being evaluated. But the home secretary told MPs she accepted they had "not been a good idea" and were too much of a "blunt instrument". Labour said Mrs May must take responsibility for the "complete failure" of the policy. Explaining her decision to ditch the campaign in the Commons, the home secretary said: "What I've done is looked at the interim evaluation in relation to the plans - and there were some returns achieved as a result of that. "Politicians should be willing to step up to the plate and say when they think something actually hasn't been as good an idea, and I think they were too blunt an instrument." But she defended government attempts to tighten up immigration enforcement when people overstay their visas, which she said had resulted in "something around 4,000 people leaving the UK". The government pilot, which saw vans driving around parts of London for a week in July, drew criticism from across the political spectrum. Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable described the campaign as "stupid" while UKIP said the scheme was "disturbing" and reminiscent of a fascist dictatorship. The vans were also criticised by the Advertising Standards Authority, which said the arrest statistics on them were misleading, although the watchdog cleared the campaign of being offensive and irresponsible. During the campaign, the vans drove around the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow - all ethnically diverse areas where it is thought a lot of illegal immigrants live and work. The poster displayed a picture of handcuffs and read: "In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest." Home Office ministers insisted the pilot had worked - and they were considering extending it elsewhere. Speaking earlier this month, Police Minister Damian Green said the "hard-hitting" campaign had "let people know that 'the traditional view that if you have been here illegally nothing would happen to you' is not the case". The Lib Dems say they were not consulted about the idea and would have opposed it had they known, and party president Tim Farron has suggested they should take credit for not allowing it to go any further. "This is a failed project and the Home Office should hold their hands up and admit it was wrong both practically and morally," he said. But Labour said it "beggared belief" that the Lib Dems were trying to "claim victory for ending a policy that they signed off in the first place". Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said her Conservative counterpart must take responsibility for the "complete failure" of the idea. "You agreed to that slogan," she said during heated exchanges in the Commons. "And you agreed to send it round communities whose parents heard it from the National Front in the 1970s and whose British citizens work in our public services, build our businesses and fight in our armed forces today. "You signed this policy off, you defended it, all for the sake of one person returning. You should be better than that. I hope you are ashamed of what you did. "You should confirm that you will never pursue such divisive gimmicks again. It is beneath you and it ought to be beneath this government." Conservative MP Henry Smith told the BBC's Daily Politics it had been an idea "worth looking at" but it had been practically flawed and made "people less willing to report if they were in the country illegally rather than more willing". A request by the BBC to see the Home Office's initial evaluation of the pilot has been turned down. The BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani requested information about the response to the ad campaign, under Freedom of Information laws. But he was told the details were intended for "future publication" and therefore were exempt from disclosure rules. It is not clear when the study will be published. </body>

      <title>Girl removed from Dublin Roma family</title>
      <description>Irish police remove a seven-year-old blonde girl from a Roma family, saying they are not satisfied the couple she is living with are her parents.</description>

      <body>Police in the Republic of Ireland have removed a seven-year-old blonde girl from a Roma family in Dublin. The girl was taken into care after officers called to a house in Tallaght on Monday afternoon. They saw a number of children, including the seven-year-old girl who has blonde hair and blue eyes. The parents told police the child was their daughter, but officers were not satisfied with the explanation nor with the documents that were produced. The Sunday World newspaper reported that a birth certificate was believed to have eventually been produced but officers were not satisfied with it. The paper reported that although the couple claimed the child was born in the Coombe hospital in Dublin in 2006, the hospital had no record of the child being born on the date quoted by the parents. The child was removed from the family under powers in the Child Care Act. It is understood the child is now in the care of the Health Service Executive (HSE). An interim care order is being sought, under which the child can remain in care for up to 28 days while a police investigation continues. Police had been told by a member of the public that a six or seven-year-old girl was living with a large Roma family and looked nothing like any of her siblings. Last week a young blonde girl was found during a raid on a Roma camp in central Greece. A Roma couple have been formally charged with abducting the girl, named Maria, and have been placed in detention pending a trial. DNA tests showed that she was not related to the couple, who insist they were given her legitimately. Maria is being cared for by a charity in Athens, which has received more than 8,000 calls after an appeal. The case has brought a response from two families in the UK with long-missing children. Ben Needham from Sheffield disappeared aged 21 months while on a family holiday on the Greek island of Kos in 1991. His sister said the discovery of the blonde-haired girl in central Greece gave them "great hope". A spokesman for Kate and Gerry McCann, whose three-year-old daughter Madeleine went missing in Portugal in 2007, said the case also gave them hope that she would one day be found alive. </body>

      <description>Syria's moderate opposition should "commit itself fully" to planned peace talks, ministers from the Friends of Syria group of countries say.</description>

      <body>Syria's moderate opposition should "commit itself fully" to planned peace talks, the Friends of Syria group of countries has said. The talks in Geneva next month offered Syrians the "best hope to improve their lives", UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said. Ministers have gathered in London to meet Syrian opposition officials. A key group in Syria's main opposition alliance has threatened to boycott the planned meeting, dubbed Geneva II. Mr Hague's US counterpart John Kerry said he believed and hoped the meeting would go ahead as planned but that Western countries could not control whether all parties would attend. Addressing the opposition, Mr Kerry said: "You can win at the negotiating table what it may take a long time and a lot of... loss of life to win on the battlefield." Ahmad Jarba, head of the main opposition grouping, the Syrian National Coalition (SNC), said the coalition would decide at a meeting next week whether to participate. The SNC has previously been unwilling to talk to representatives of Mr Assad's government. Mr Hague said the process envisaged by the Friends of Syria involved the establishment "by mutual consent" of "a transitional governing body with full executive powers". Participants at the first round of talks in June 2012 (Geneva I) had sought to end the civil war by getting Damascus and the opposition to choose a transitional government. Mr Hague reaffirmed the view of the Friends of Syria group - Britain, Egypt, France, Germany, Jordan, Italy, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United States - that Geneva II must be about a political transition in Syria away from the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Any transitional government could only be agreed with the consent of the SNC, and therefore Mr Assad would play no role in it, Mr Hague added. Mr Kerry said he expected representatives of the government to attend any talks and to "negotiate in good faith". Mr Hague and Mr Kerry also pledged further backing for Syria's moderate opposition, aimed at bolstering them in the face of rising influence extremists from power in the war-gripped country. Mr Jarba also spoke to reporters after meeting, outlining the steps that he considered necessary for the success of the Geneva talks. He called for safe corridors to be established to deliver humanitarian aid to opposition-held areas currently besieged by government forces. Mr Jarba also called for women and children he said were in regime custody to be released. He also expressed opposition to the idea of Iran having an active role in the process, accusing Iran of having tens of thousands of militiamen active in Syria. Iran as yet has no role in Geneva II, but Mr Hague earlier told the BBC he was trying to use new positive diplomatic relations with Iran to encourage it to play a "more constructive role". Also on Tuesday, the UN Special Co-ordinator for the mission to destroy Syria's chemical weapons, Sigrid Kaag, said in a statement that to date, the Syrian government had "fully co-operated" in the mission's work. Western officials have been buoyed by the initial results of the chemical disarmament effort, the BBC's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says. But he adds that they are painfully aware that the recent chemical deal has done nothing to alter the course of the civil war or to reduce the burgeoning humanitarian catastrophe in and around Syria. On Monday, Mr Assad told Lebanon's al-Mayadeen television that he saw no reason why he could not run for the presidency again. "Personally, I don't see any obstacles to being nominated to run in the next presidential elections," he was quoted as saying by the channel. Mr Assad told the channel that his government would take part in the conference without preconditions, but suggested the prospects that it would reach a settlement were, at present, dim. "No time has been set, and the factors are not yet in place if we want to succeed," he told al-Mayadeen. "Which forces are taking part? What relation do these forces have with the Syrian people? Do these forces represent the Syrian people, or do they represent the states that invented them?" he asked. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are key funders of opposition forces in Syria, including, it is believed, hardline Islamist groups. More than 100,000 people have been killed since the Syrian conflict began in 2011. The UN estimates that by the end of 2014 more than eight million Syrians could have been forced from their homes, including 5.2 million who will have fled the country. </body>

      <description>Former BBC broadcaster Stuart Hall is stripped of his OBE by the Queen after he was jailed for a series of sexual assaults on young girls.</description>

      <body>Former BBC broadcaster Stuart Hall has been stripped of his OBE by the Queen after he was jailed for a series of sexual assaults on young girls. The Queen has directed the honour should be "cancelled and annulled" and his name be "erased" from the register. In June, Hall, 83, admitted 14 counts against girls aged from nine to 17 between 1967 and 1985. His 15-month sentence was doubled by the Court of Appeal in July. Hall was made an OBE in December 2011. An independent forfeiture committee recommended he should lose his honour for bringing the system into disrepute. The Honours Forfeiture Committee's recommendation was sent to the Queen by the Prime Minister. Her final decision was published in the London Gazette, the official Crown newspaper. Hall was initially arrested in December 2012 and made a statement labelling the claims "pernicious, callous, cruel and above all spurious". Preston Crown Court heard the former It's a Knockout host was an "opportunistic predator" who used his fame to befriend girls. About 150 complaints were made concerning the length of Hall's original prison term. At the Court of Appeal, Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge said the original sentence was "unduly lenient" given the impact on Hall's victims. Lord Judge said Hall had "got away with it" for decades and had "lived a lie for more than half of his life". Hall had been a familiar face and voice in British broadcasting for half a century, and was appointed OBE in the 2012 New Year Honours. He is expected to serve half of his 30-month sentence, meaning he will be released in September 2014, the BBC understands. Lancashire Police has been investigating further historical allegations against Hall which they received after he was jailed. </body>

      <title>'Plebgate has hit trust' in police</title>
      <description>One in four people say they are "less likely" to trust police after accusations of misconduct by officers in the "Plebgate" row, a poll for the BBC finds.</description>

      <body>One in four people say they are "less likely" to trust police in the wake of "Plebgate", a poll for the BBC found. Despite accusations officers lied to undermine then cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell, the ComRes survey of 1,000 people found 82% are still likely to believe what the police say. Mr Mitchell has denied calling police "plebs" outside Downing Street. Officers from the police union in his constituency have apologised for "poor judgement" over the affair. The apology came after a transcript emerged of a meeting they had attended with Mr Mitchell, then government chief whip. The Independent Police Complaints Commission has said the officers misrepresented him at a press conference after the meeting, which the minister had called to defuse the row with police. The BBC's poll asked how the affair had affected people's "opinion" of the police. While 67% said it had made "no difference", 26% responded that it had made them "slightly less" or "much less" likely to trust the police. Only 5% said the affair had increased their trust in the police. The poll suggests public trust overall remains high, with 82% saying they were "very likely" or "fairly likely" to believe officers speaking either on television or on the streets while on duty. But it found that 40% agreed with the statement: "Generally, the police seem to try to cover up wrongdoing by those in its ranks." And in Mr Mitchell's West Midlands region as well as in Scotland and among skilled manual workers, overall trust was fractionally lower, with one in five saying they were unlikely to believe what officers say. The three officers accused by the IPCC of having tried to discredit Mr Mitchell are due to appear before MPs on the influential Home Affairs Select Committee on Wednesday. The inspector who investigated the comments made by the officers after the meeting has also been called to appear. But the Police and Crime Commissioner for one of the forces concerned accused friends of the ex-minister of "baying for blood" over the affair. Warwickshire PCC Ron Ball said Mr Mitchell and his supporters should have accepted the Police Federation's apology.

      <body>A UK hedge fund has become the biggest shareholder of Royal Mail after the British government. The Children's Investment Fund (TCI) has bought a 5.8% stake in Royal Mail worth £286m ($462m). TCI is considered to be an activist investor which means it pressures management to make changes. The Labour Party says TCI's investment is a sign that the privatisation is benefiting "big money investors in the City" and not the taxpayer. Royal Mail shares were priced at 330p earlier this month, but have since risen by more than 50%, which has spurred critics who accuse the government of selling off Royal Mail too cheaply. Ian Murray, Labour's Shadow Minister for Trade and Investment said: "David Cameron's Royal Mail fire sale has seen the vast majority of shares going to big money investors in the City while the taxpayer is left short changed." Labour Peer Lord Sugar, perhaps best known for his role in the BBC1 series The Apprentice, become the latest critical voice, when he questioned government business spokesman Lord Popat in parliament. He questioned the advice of UBS, Lazards and Goldman Sachs who advised the government over the price and timing of the sale. "Bearing in mind other reputable banks had come on record giving a valuation of £5bn, why were these banks ignored and what will you be doing by way of an inquiry in finding out who the lucky institutions were that underwrote this bargain basement sale?" Lord Sugar said. Lord Popat said that the government had been focused on securing "value for the taxpayer". He also said that the banks who helped with the sale of the Royal Mail could receive up to £18.4m in fees. </body>

      <body>Police failings in part led to the killing of a mother and son by her ex-partner, an inquest jury has ruled. Andrew Cairns, 44, stabbed Rachael Slack, 38, and their 23-month-old son Auden on 2 June 2010 at her home in Holbrook, Derbyshire. The jury found police failure to impress on Ms Slack the danger she and Auden faced "more than minimally contributed" to their deaths. Ms Slack and Auden were unlawfully killed and Cairns took his own life. Coroner Dr Robert Hunter said he would be writing to the Home Secretary to raise issues over the powers police have to detain suspects in cases concerning violent or sexual incidents, national training standards in domestic violence for police, electronic document sharing and mutual disclosure of information. Police had assessed Ms Slack to be at at risk but it emerged during the five-week inquest at Derbyshire Coroner's Court that they were unclear if she had been warned. The inquest heard Andrew Cairns had a long history of mental health problems. In the weeks running up to the attack he had been detained under the Mental Health Act, assessed and released. The jury heard he had also been arrested for making threats to kill Ms Slack, and was later bailed. They were also told that following his contact with Derbyshire Constabulary, Ms Slack and Auden were deemed as being at high risk of homicide but police officers failed to properly impart that to Ms Slack. On the morning of 2 June, Cairns went to his GP and seemed agitated. When he left the surgery, he went to Ms Slack's home. A neighbour reported hearing screams coming from the house. Post-mortem examination results showed Ms Slack had been stabbed 32 times in the chest and back. Cairns had 18 stab wounds to his abdomen and chest and the inquest heard Auden, who had been stabbed 16 times, died from multiple wounds to his chest and abdomen. Ms Slack was pregnant at the time of her death and in a relationship with Robert Barlow. He said: "Knowing that Rachael was a high risk of homicide means that we could have adjusted our lives to be a lot more vigilant. "I think it's a key point that we definitely needed to know. I do in the long term think it would have made a difference, without a shadow of a doubt." Hayden and Melony Slack, Rachael Slack's brother and sister-in-law, said: "The space that has been left in our lives by the tragic loss of Rachael and Auden will never be filled and never should be. "Rachael was a devoted mother, a beautiful and truly caring person with a positive outlook on life. "We hope that the jury's findings that the police failings contributed to the deaths of Rachael and Auden, and the various reports to be made by the coroner, will ensure that lessons are learned that could protect the lives of other women and children threatened by domestic violence - a problem the coroner described as an 'epidemic'." In a statement Derbyshire Police Assistant Chief Constable Karl Smethem said: "I am confident that Derbyshire Constabulary's policies and procedures for the investigation of domestic violence incidents, and for the protection of victims, met national guidelines in 2010. "From the evidence it is clear that Rachael's report of Andrew Cairns' verbal threat to kill was taken very seriously by the police. "We were actively investigating the threat, with a view to charging him, and we did take steps to ensure that Rachael and Auden's home was secure." In a statement, the family of Andrew Cairns said mental health services failed to keep proper records or co-ordinate his care. </body>

      <description>Kenya's army chief denies troops looted during last month's siege at a Nairobi mall, after CCTV images showed soldiers in a supermarket.</description>

      <body>Kenya's army chief has denied his troops were involved in looting during last month's siege at a Nairobi mall. Gen Julius Karangi told a parliamentary committee they had only taken water from a store in the Westgate Mall "to quench their thirst". His remarks come after CCTV footage emerged of troops carrying shopping bags out of the Nakumatt store. At least 67 people died when suspected al-Shabab militants stormed the Nairobi shopping centre on 21 September. News agencies say the CCTV footage which was released over the weekend is taken inside the entrance to the Westgate mall's Nakumatt supermarket, which sells everything from food to televisions. In one section of footage, several soldiers are seen walking out of the supermarket, past a blood-spattered floor, carrying plastic carrier bags. In another clip, Kenyan soldiers can be seen next to a mobile phone outlet. Gen Karangi was speaking to the joint committees on National Security and Defence, which are meeting behind closed doors. He said soldiers had only "picked water from the Nakumatt store to quench their thirst" and that they had only done it "with authority from their commanders" Commenting on other items that were taken away, Gen Karangi reportedly said this was "sanitisation to ensure their safety." The Kenyan military says it has launched an investigation into the looting allegations, which correspondents say will have angered many Kenyans. At the weekend, Kenya's biggest-selling newspaper, The Nation, ran an article entitled "Shame of soldiers looting Westgate". The footage of the alleged looting emerged as the Kenyan authorities announced they had recovered the body of what they consider to be a fourth attacker. The Westgate attack sparked a four-day siege in which large parts of the shopping centre were destroyed. </body>

      <title>Apple shows off thinner iPad Air</title>
      <description>Apple shows off a new thinner top-of-the range iPad, which it says is lighter than any other full-sized tablet on the market.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24629711</url>
      <date>1382470481</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70645000/png/_70645910_air.png</thumbnail>
      <body>Apple has unveiled a top-of-the-range tablet called the iPad Air that is 20% thinner than the previous version. The 9.7in (24.6cm) computer is 7.5mm (0.3in) thick and weighs 1lb (469g), which the firm claims is the lightest full-sized tablet on the market. It is powered by the same A7 chip found in the company's iPhone 5S. The launch comes at a time when some analysts have suggested that Google's Android is about to overtake Apple's iOS as the bestselling tablet platform. Apple also announced a new version of its iPad Mini. Its 7.9in (20cm) screen has been upgraded to feature 2048 by 1536 pixels - the same as the larger model. It is being branded as "retina" to highlight the increased resolution. Amazon and Google have already announced small tablets - the Kindle Fire HDX and Nexus 7 - with similar high definition displays. "We've got the retina upgrade to the smaller iPad that many thought should have been there in the first place," Tony Cripps, principal analyst at tech consultants Ovum, reflected after the announcement in San Francisco. "Market share slip is inevitable because so many rival devices are coming out, which is not necessarily a bad thing as the overall sector is growing. "Apple does now have a cheaper model thanks to it offering the original iPad Mini at a lower price - but the firm doesn't really want to go to the low-end because that's not where the greatest profit is extracted." Apple also announced that the latest version of its Mac operating system, Mavericks, would be offered at no cost to owners of any compatible computer. It is the first time the company has not charged for a major Mac OS upgrade. By contrast the full version of Windows 8.1 is sold for about £100, although it is free to existing Windows 8 users. Linux-based Ubuntu has always been offered without charge. New laptops, productivity and leisure apps were also unveiled. However, Apple did not show off a new TV set-top box as some had speculated. The California-based firm's most recent financial release said that its iPad range accounted for $25.8bn (£17.6bn) worth of sales in the nine months leading up to July. That represented 19% of its revenue for the period. However, Apple acknowledged that the amount of money it was making from the product line was growing three times slower than the growth in unit sales since many customers were opting for its cheaper iPad Mini and iPad 2 models rather than its top-of-the -range "retina display" versions. It also faces the fact it is losing market share to rivals. Apple's iOS operating system accounted for 53.9% of all tablets shipped in 2012, according to Gartner. The tech research firm forecasts that Android will become the market leader with a 49.6% share, versus Apple's 48.6% this year, adding that it expects that gap to widen further in 2014. However, consultants at IHS iSuppli said those figures needed to be put in context thanks to Apple's success at making money by taking a cut of app sales. "It is in terms of revenue per active device where Apple's lead is strongest," said the firm's mobile media analyst Jack Kent. "An iOS device generates around three to four times as much app revenue through Apple's App Store as an Android device through Google Play. "Apple has so far offered a more compelling range of tablet-specific content, but Google is clearly looking to address this." He added that many Android tablets, including Amazon's Kindle and most products sold in China, did not have Google's store pre-installed. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook noted there were now 475,000 apps designed for iPads available through its online marketplace. But another market watcher suggested that Apple's priority remained securing a "premium" margin on the shop price of its hardware, and that add-on software sales were of secondary interest. "Some players, like Amazon, can afford to slash prices because they have a different business model based on content and commerce," said Thomas Husson, from the tech industry analysts Forrester. "While Apple has shared $13bn to developers since 2008, it has made less than $6bn out of apps. "It's a huge stat, but low in comparison with Apple's quarterly results." </body>

      <title>First venomous crustacean found</title>
      <description>Experts have found the first venomous crustacean - a centipede-like creature that lives in underwater caves.</description>

      <body>Experts have found the first venomous crustacean - a centipede-like creature that lives in underwater caves. The blind "remipede" liquefies its prey with a compound similar to that found in a rattlesnake's fangs. It lives in underwater caves of the Caribbean, Canary Islands and Western Australia, feeding on other crustaceans. The venom contains a complex cocktail of toxins, including enzymes and a paralysing agent. The findings are detailed in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution. The remipede (Speleonectes tulumensis) breaks down body tissues with its venom and then sucks out a liquid meal from its prey's exoskeleton. Co-author Dr Ronald Jenner, a zoologist at London's Natural History Museum said: "The unique insights from this study really help improve our understanding of the evolution of animal venoms. "The spider-like feeding technique of the remipede is unique among crustaceans. This venom is clearly a great adaptation for these blind cave-dwellers that live in nutrient-poor underwater caves." Crustaceans are a large group of the wider category of animals known as arthropods. They include shrimp, krill, lobsters and crabs. Most are aquatic, but a few - such as woodlice - live on land. Dr Bjoern von Reumont, also from the Natural History Museum commented: "This is the first time we have seen venom being used in crustaceans and the study adds a new major animal group to the roster of known venomous animals. "Venoms are especially common in three of the four major groups of arthropods, such as insects. Crustaceans, however, are a glaring exception to the rule. "While they can be as varied as tiny waterfleas, krill, crabs and barnacles, not one of the approximately 70,000 described species of crustaceans was known, until now, to be venomous." </body>

      <title>Queen visits National Theatre at 50</title>
      <description>The Queen meets one of the puppets from stage show War Horse during her tour of the National Theatre as the institution celebrates its 50th birthday.</description>

      <body>The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have visited the National Theatre, as the institution celebrates its 50th birthday. During the tour, the Queen met one of the puppet horses from the NT's acclaimed production of War Horse. The Queen has previously seen the show, based on Michael Morpurgo's novel, which tells the story of Joey, a horse who serves in World War I. NT director Sir Nicholas Hytner said it had been "a very special day". Tuesday is 50 years to the day since the first National Theatre production. Peter O'Toole played Hamlet on 22 October 1963 at the Old Vic theatre, the NT's original home, under the direction of its founder Sir Laurence Olivier. Among the cast in that first performance was the 23-year-old actor Michael Gambon. Speaking at a 50th anniversary talk at the National's Olivier Theatre on Tuesday night, Sir Michael recalled: "I never had to speak. I was just at the back with a spear." He added: "I used to walk out of the stage door at night at the Old Vic and put myself just behind Sir Laurence as he was going out to his car to seem as though I was one of his friends." Actress Sheila Reid, who appeared in Olivier's Othello in 1964, said that appearing stage with Sir Laurence "was a bit like playing tennis with somebody better than yourself". The NT moved to its current home on the South Bank in 1976. More than 800 productions have taken place over the last 50 years, including premieres of plays by Tom Stoppard, Peter Shaffer, Harold Pinter, Alan Bennett and David Hare. During their visit on Tuesday, the Queen and Prince Philip were were given a tour by outgoing director Sir Nicholas Hytner. They heard a musical number from Guys and Dolls, the first musical staged to be staged at the National in 1982, and watched a rehearsal for the forthcoming production Emil And The Detectives, based on the story of a boy living in 1920s Berlin. Dame Joan Plowright, who was married to Sir Laurence Olivier when he led the National Theatre, also met the Queen. The actress said: "It's a very special day, it's quite hard not to feel quite emotional about it. "I remember what the day was like when it was about to open - the nerves and apprehension. It's a huge task to take on the first season of a new national theatre." Dame Joan added: "It's had quite a history - I would say more triumphs then disasters." The Queen also unveiled a plaque to mark her visit and the 50th anniversary. Tuesday's encounter with War Horse puppet Joey wasn't the first time the Queen had met the mechanical star of the show, which is in the West End and abroad. During the Diamond Jubilee River Thames pageant last summer, the Queen appeared to enjoy watching the animal running across the roof of the National Theatre, which first staged the play, as the royal barge sailed past. As her tour of the theatre company ended, she told the puppet horse: "It's lovely to see you again." Puppeteer Gareth Aled said after meeting the Queen: "She's familiar with horses and with Joey, it's a very lovely privilege to have that meeting, she knows horses probably better than we do." Joey walked up to the Queen and followed her as she walked to her waiting state limousine before rearing up on his hind legs as the car departed. Mr Aled added: "It's all about striving for realistic horse movement, every horse movement should feel life-like." The National Theatre's 50th year is being marked by a series of events, including a star-studded gala on 2 November which will be shown on BBC Two. Famous alumni including Dame Judi Dench, Simon Russell Beale, Sir Michael Gambon, Sir Derek Jacobi and Dame Maggie Smith will perform speeches from roles they have played there. Dame Maggie will reprise her role as Mrs Sullen in George Farquhar's comedy The Beaux' Stratagem, Russell Beale will return to Hamlet, while Dame Judi, who appeared in Antony and Cleopatra in 1987, will re-enact the elegy to Antony. "I'm frightened, but I'm thrilled to be part of it," Dame Judi told the BBC. Sir Nicholas Hytner even hinted to the Evening Standard that blockbuster show The History Boys, which launched the career of James Corden, could even make a return for the gala. Dame Judi said the institution was still "essential" as it celebrated its golden anniversary. "The place is absolutely buzzing with people," she told BBC entertainment correspondent Lizo Mzimba. "There are exhibitions, there is music, there are three theatres going. It's a very alive place. "We need that to stimulate our emotions. We need to see things that make us cry, laugh, think about something, be excited, be saddened, be angry. "We were so long without a National Theatre," she added, "and we've been very, very lucky." Sir Nicholas Hytner leaves the National Theatre in 2015, when he will be replaced by Rufus Norris, whose credits include The Amen Corner and Dr Dee: An English Opera. The role is widely regarded as the biggest job in British theatre. Norris, who was appointed last week, called it "a great honour". </body>

      <title>Energy bosses called before MPs</title>
      <description>Bosses from the UK's six biggest energy firms are being called before MPs to give evidence about recent price rises.</description>

      <body>Bosses from the UK's six biggest energy firms have been called to give evidence to MPs about recent price rises. The Energy and Climate Change Committee will quiz the bosses on 29 October. In the past two weeks, three of the "big six" energy firms have announced gas and electricity price rises. Npower's dual-fuel bills will go up by 10.4% on 1 December, SSE will increase prices by 8.2% from 15 November and British Gas's prices are due to rise by 9.2% on 23 November. Analysts expect the others - Scottish Power, E.On and EDF - to follow suit by increasing prices. Scottish Power, which has just been hit with a penalty by regulator Ofgem after sales staff misled customers, said it faced the same cost pressures as competitors and was likely to "move on prices" before the end of the year. The chairman of the committee of MPs, Sir Robert Smith, said: "The committee has today decided to call in the energy bosses in the context of the latest wave of price increases." The committee said the session would examine the "reasons and justification" behind recent price rises, the difference of pricing policies between the firms, and how "the transparency of energy company profits can be improved". The energy companies have argued that the price rises were the result of higher wholesale costs, increased costs in delivering energy to customers' homes, and the effect of the levy charged to companies to fund environmental measures. The recent energy price increases have coincided with considerable political debate about the cost of gas and electricity to households. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But Prime Minister David Cameron has branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan a "con", saying that he does not have control over the worldwide price of gas. Meanwhile, former prime minister Sir John Major has called for a windfall tax on the profits of the UK's top energy firms. </body>

But when 5 live reporter Lesley Ashmall asked people whether they would consider switching, most were unwilling to make the change. Dr. Neil Stewart, an expert in the psychology of economic decisions, believes this is because people can be too scared to switch.

      <title>Would-be MPs 'should be vetted'</title>
      <description>Would-be MPs should be forced to meet "pre-qualification criteria" before being allowed to stand, says former Cabinet Secretary Lord O'Donnell.</description>

      <body>Would-be MPs should be forced to meet "pre-qualification criteria" before being allowed to stand, a former cabinet secretary has suggested. Lord O'Donnell - once the UK's most senior civil servant - said the idea could make Parliament more effective. Government policies would also be vetted by former ministers, accountants and ex-civil servants under Lord O'Donnell's proposals. He said radical change was needed as the country was in a "bad place". In an article for The Political Quarterly, the former civil service chief said: Lord O'Donnell did not spell out what criteria he thought candidates for Parliament should meet. But a Cabinet Office source dismissed the idea. The source said: "It is not clear who would oversee the pre-qualification of Parliamentary candidates, and for what purpose. At present they undergo rigorous scrutiny by the electorate. It's called democracy" Lord O'Donnell said MPs could get training to prepare them for jobs as ministers. He wrote: "There are very few jobs that do not require individuals to undertake training and development before being promoted, so this would bring MPs into line with the reality of their constituents' lives." A new body called the Office for Taxpayer Responsibility would be established to vet both government policies and opposition manifestos. He wrote: "The rising trend in obesity, the growth of dementia and Alzheimer's and mental health issues in general make it hard to see how the state can afford to help all who need it." Falling potential economic growth and an increasing demand on public services created a "vicious pincer movement", he said. Voters were put off politics by the way politicians behaved on occasions like Prime Minister's Questions, and some new MPs were already disillusioned with their jobs. They increasingly faced a choice between free, but second rate, public services and expensive private provision. "We are in a bad place," wrote the former cabinet secretary. "But it is a stable bad place." Despite rejecting Lord O'Donnell's ideas for parliamentary candidates, the Cabinet Office source accepted improvements were needed. He said: "The current leadership of the Civil Service have identified serious deficiencies in capabilities, in talent management and development, and in a culture that too often stifles innovation and has a bias to inertia. "That's why together we are implementing a programme of Civil Service reform to deal with these issues which had been ignored for far too long." </body>

      <title>NHS 'can save £500m' on foreign care</title>
      <description>Up to £500m could be recovered from overseas visitors and migrants using the NHS every year, ministers believe.</description>

      <body>Up to £500m could be recovered from overseas visitors and migrants using the NHS every year, ministers believe. An independent report commissioned by the Department of Health estimated these groups cost the NHS £2bn a year. Ministers said some of that spending was unavoidable, but said it would be realistic to save a quarter. Savings would come from deterring so-called health tourism, recovering money owed by other countries and a levy on non-European temporary residents. One senior doctor questioned the government's figures and said doctors should not have to spend time "vetting eligibility" of patients. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he did not want to "turn GPs into border guards" and no-one would be denied emergency treatment, but foreign visitors must make a "fair contribution". Mr Hunt said he recognised the NHS's duty of care must "transcend" financial concerns, but collecting an extra £500m a year could pay for 4,000 extra doctors. "We have one of the most generous systems in the world when it comes to healthcare for foreign visitors, but it's time for action to ensure the NHS is a national health service - not an international one," he added. The latest research is published in two separate reports by firms Prederi and Creative Research. The government has been criticised for using financial estimates from the Prederi report, but Mr Hunt said it was the "most thorough research there has ever been" in this area. The report itself notes that it is based on "incomplete data, sometimes of varying quality, and a large number of assumptions", but it says the estimates are the "best that can be made at present", and Mr Hunt said researchers had been "completely honest about what they do know and what they don't know". The government is currently consulting on the measures it will take to tackle this issue. It has already announced a £200-a-year levy on migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) staying for between six months and five years, and Mr Hunt said this could raise £200m a year. A cost-recovery unit will also be set up to help hospitals claw back money they are owed by other governments for treating foreign nationals visiting the UK. Meanwhile, "deliberate health tourism" - whereby people travel to the UK to get NHS care - is estimated by Prederi to cost between £60m and £80m a year. The report's authors concede this figure is "uncertain" and the "plausible range" of the cost is £20m-£100m. Frequent visitors "taking advantage" by registering with GPs and getting access to prescriptions and some hospital referrals cost the NHS a further £50m-£200m a year, the report adds. The government accepts it cannot recoup all of this money and entirely stop health tourism and so it has put forward the "conservative" £500m figure. To achieve this, it said a better system of identifying when visitors and migrants got treatment was needed. More details on what this will involve will be revealed in the coming weeks. Free NHS care is offered to anyone with living in the UK who has temporary or permanent permission to do so. Asylum seekers, non-EEA nationals who do not have permission to live in the UK, British ex-pats and visitors usually have to pay for treatment. The UK has reciprocal agreements with most European nations and 28 other countries, and under these visitors are given free NHS care. The NHS should claim these costs back from the relevant governments - but the research suggests just £73m a year is recouped out of more than £460m at present. This is because there is a perverse incentive in the system whereby if they declare the fact they have treated a foreign national it is up to the individual hospital to chase up the home nation for the money whereas if they do not declare it they get money from the NHS system for seeing a patient entitled to care. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: "We are not against improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to NHS treatment." But he added the figures were based on a "large number of assumptions" and was more about "spin than substance". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs committee, said the government's £500m savings figure was "exaggerated", partly because it did not take account of the costs of implementing its plans. He said migrants paying the proposed £200-a-year levy could be more likely to use the NHS to "get their money's worth", and he said the cost of a single hospital outpatient appointment would be more than £200. Dr Nagpaul said doctors should not be distracted from their work in order to check the eligibility of patients for treatments. Dr Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said it was imperative GPs were not tasked with being a "new border agency" in policing the NHS. "The risks to public health that will arise from these proposals are also very real. They will deter people from seeking medical help in the early stages of illness when they can be dealt with cost-effectively and efficiently in primary care, rather than requiring expensive specialist care and increasing admissions to emergency departments," she said. Jonathan Portes, of the Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank, said the research revealed the extent of deliberate health tourism had been "hugely overstated" and was in fact a "very small part of NHS expenditure". </body>

      <title>Most A-level grade predictions wrong</title>
      <description>An exam body reveals that most A-level grade predictions from schools are incorrect when final results are published</description>

      <body>Most A-level grade predictions made by teachers are incorrect when the final results are published, according to data revealed by an exam body. Predicted grades are an important part of the university application process. Only 48% of predicted grades were correct for pupils taking the OCR exam board's A-levels in summer 2012, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Almost one in 10 of the wrong forecasts, more than 15,000 entries, were incorrect by more than one grade. For this one exam board, there were more than 186,000 incorrect forecasts for that summer's A-levels. These teacher forecasts were gathered by the OCR board in May, a few weeks ahead of the exam season. As such they should have been more accurate than the January predictions used in the university admissions system. The findings could re-ignite questions about the fairness of a prediction-based university application system, before pupils know their results. Although, the exam body says, it means more than 90% of forecasts were correct within a margin of one grade. The A-level statistics published by Cambridge Assessment, OCR's parent body, show that teachers were much more likely to be over-optimistic about results - with 39% over-predicting, compared with 13% whose predictions turned out to be lower than the actual grades. Independent school teachers were the most accurate in predicting the right grade, followed by grammar schools, academies, sixth form colleges and comprehensives. The lowest level of accuracy was for teachers in further education. Predictions from further education colleges, as the least accurate at both ends of the scale, were both the most likely to be over-optimistic and the most likely to be wrongly pessimistic. Independent and grammar schools were the toughest in terms of predictions, with the lowest levels of over-optimism. Teachers were much stronger at predicting the highest grades, A* and A, with more than 60% accuracy. For C-grades, only 47% had been correctly predicted. But the figures also show that over a range of subjects, when a pupil is forecast three A-grades or better, only 35% of these predictions prove to be correct. Oxford University said that there were other factors considered in applications, as well as predicted grades. "We look carefully at a range of factors when considering a student's application, including GCSE scores, aptitude test results, interview performance, teacher reference and Ucas statement, so that we are not reliant on predicted grades to select the very best students," said admissions spokesman, Matt Pickles. </body>

      <title>Nokia reveals phablets and tablets</title>
      <description>Two Windows Phone phablets and a Windows RT tablet are among the final devices unveiled by Nokia ahead of the sale of its hardware unit to Microsoft.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24608498</url>
      <date>1382455107</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70623000/jpg/_70623410_noka.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Nokia has unveiled its first phablets - extra-large phones - as well as its first tablet computer. The Windows Phone handsets introduce the ability to change which objects in a photo are in focus after it is taken. The Windows RT tablet has a 4G data chip, unlike Microsoft's recently unveiled Surface 2. Nokia World in Abu Dhabi is likely to be remembered as the Finnish firm's last major event before it completes the sale of its hardware unit. Microsoft agreed to buy the business for 5.4bn euros ($7.4bn; £4.6bn) in a deal which the companies have said should be finalised by early 2014. Nokia's former chief executive Stephen Elop, who resigned to become head of the company's devices and services division until his transfer to Microsoft, admitted to the BBC that choosing Windows Phone rather than Android as an operating system had presented the company with "a very difficult challenge." "It's been hard. It's a very difficult challenge; it's a very competitive environment, but we're pleased with the fact that we're building momentum," he said. One analyst said the sale should aid the US firm's efforts to promote its mobile platforms against the market leaders, Google Android and Apple iOS. "For the last two years Microsoft and Nokia's marketing efforts have jarred against each other at times - having one big effort should be better than two smaller ones," said Martin Garner, from the consultancy CCS Insight. "Microsoft can also spend a lot more marketing the devices than Nokia could. That does seem to be a key criteria - both Samsung and Apple's spends are very high indeed." Microsoft's share of the handset and tablet markets is growing but from a relatively low level, according to market research firm Gartner. Windows Phone took a 3.3% share of smartphone sales in the April-to-June quarter, said the firm, with Nokia proving the most popular brand. It also forecast that about 1.7% of all tablets shipped over 2013 as a whole would be powered by either Windows RT or the full Windows 8 operating system. Nokia showed off two phablets at the UAE launch. Both the Lumia 1520 and Lumia 1320 feature 6in (15.2cm) displays, allowing extra rows of apps to be displayed on their home screens than possible on smaller models. The firm said that the extra space would also make it easier to use the phones' touchscreen keyboards, suggesting this would appeal to business users who used productivity software. A new Beamer app will allow the phones to stream the contents of their screens onto to a web browser on a separate display. It works by sending data via Nokia's computer servers. Another new app - Refocus - lets owners determine which parts of a photograph are in focus and which are blurred after it is taken. The phones achieve this by taking a series of images in quick succession at different focus lengths rather than replicating the light field effect captured by a Lytro camera. Blackberry is among the other companies to have recently launched a phablet, but one expert said doubts about the Canadian firm's future meant that its existing users might be tempted to switch. "There's definitely a chance for Nokia to gain ground, of course everyone else is interested in that space too," said Mr Garner. "It's not a slam dunk, but Microsoft is as well placed as others - better in some respects." The Lumia 2520 becomes the only Windows RT tablet made by a manufacturer other than Microsoft. Dell, Asus, Lenovo, Acer and Samsung had all initially backed the platform only to later change tack. The operating system runs on an ARM-based chip allowing it to offer superior battery life to the full Windows 8 system running on tablets powered by x86 processors, but it does not support as many programs. Nokia's tablet is slightly more compact than Microsoft's version and also distinguishes itself by supporting an optional 4G Sim card. However, bearing in mind Microsoft has already taken a $900m writedown after weak sales of its original Surface RT tablet, one analyst questioned whether the firm would want to produce two competing models. "I don't think that having two devices in that space makes a lot of sense," said Carolina Milanesi, consumer devices analyst at Gartner. "I believe Microsoft may keep the Nokia model on as a cheaper consumer-targeted device focused on media consumption and gaming in order to capture more market share, and also keep on the more expensive Intel-based Surface Pro - but it will phase out the Surface 2 RT model." Nokia also added three models to its Asha range of low-end handsets targeted at emerging markets and shoppers on a budget. They run Nokia's proprietary Series 40 OS rather than Windows Phone. The most expensive of the devices, the Asha 530, now supports 3G data in addition to 2G, allowing faster internet access. "It's important for Nokia and Microsoft to connect the next billion people," said Mr Elop, suggesting that Microsoft would find Asha's popularity a convenient way to promote other services such as its Skydrive cloud storage product. But one market watcher questioned Asha's future. "There's still quite a lot of demand for Asha in developing markets where the phones offer brand-value against other low-cost mass-market handsets," said Chris Green from the Davies Murphy Group consultancy. "So, there's no sense to killing the business while it remains highly profitable. "But will it be a core focus? Absolutely not. It will be a distraction and Microsoft will be keen to migrate users to the Windows Phone platform." </body>

      <title>Exoplanet tally soars above 1,000</title>
      <description>The number of observed exoplanets - those orbiting distant stars - passes 1,000 and of these, 12 might be habitable, scientists claim.</description>

      <body>The number of observed exoplanets - worlds circling distant stars - has passed 1,000. Of these, 12 could be habitable - orbiting at a distance where it is neither "too hot" nor "too cold" for water to be liquid on the surface. The planets are given away by tiny dips in light as they pass in front of their stars or through gravitational "tugs" on the star from an orbiting world. These new worlds are listed in the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia. The tally now stands at 1,010 new exoplanets, bolstered by 11 new finds from the UK's Wide Angle Search for Planets (Wasp). Abel Mendez of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico, said that although the number has rapidly increased in recent years, due to a lack of funding this figure is much lower than it could be. "We have more techniques and proven technology to detect more exoplanets, but the limit has been telescopes, especially space telescopes. "If we had more funding there would be more telescopes and that count would be much larger by now." The Kepler space telescope, which spotted many of these worlds in recent years, broke down earlier this year. Scientists still have to trawl through more than 3,500 other candidates from this mission so the number could rapidly increase. In January 2013, astronomers used Kepler's data to estimate that there could be at least 17 billion Earth-sized exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy. They said that one in six stars could host an Earth-sized planet in close orbit. The number of confirmed planets frequently increases because as scientists analyse the data they are able publish their results online immediately. But as the finds are not yet peer reviewed, the total figure remains subject to change. "Each night we get a list of astronomy papers where there might be an exoplanet announcement. When we get that we have to review it," explained Prof Mendez. This exoplanet catalogue is organised by Jean Schneider, an astronomer at the Paris Observatory. For the past 18 years he has catalogued new exoplanets on the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia. Others in the field, like Prof Mendez, are then able to review and comment on the findings, which makes it "more dynamic" he explained. "That's why the other catalogues just lag behind. The review is reliable as it's exactly the same as what the journals do." Prof Mendez told BBC News. Nasa will only accept those announced in an academic journal, so it updates its list far less frequently. Their tally currently stands at 919 confirmed worlds. Jean Schneider said it was also important to note that there was "no consensus for the definition of a planet" and that past experience had shown that a few objects declared as planets were actually artefacts or low-mass stars. "Some objects, like some Kepler planets, are declared 'confirmed planets' but have not been published in [referenced] articles. It does not mean that they will not be published later on, but it introduces another fuzziness in the tally," he added. Even if there was a generally adopted definition, Mr Schneider said that for some objects "there is a large uncertainty on parameters, so that the planetary nature of the object is uncertain". For Prof Mendez reaching 1,000 marks an important milestone in the quest to understand the history of the evolution of the cosmos. "I don't just want to know where the exoplanets are, I want to understand the stars, because they are the hosts for the planets. I want to understand the whole galaxy and the distribution of the stars because everything is connected," he explained. For him, the most exciting discoveries are Earth-like planets which could be habitable. "We want to know how unique our planet is, that's a big question and we are now closer than ever," he added. For Mr Schneider the most interesting is the candidate exoplanet around Alpha Centauri, as it is circling a star only four light-years away. This planet likely has the same mass as Earth but is outside the "habitable zone" as it circles its star far closer than Mercury orbits our Sun. </body>

      <title>BBC 'would air' Comic Relief claims</title>
      <description>BBC Director General Tony Hall tells a parliamentary select committee that a Panorama programme containing claims against Comic Relief, will be broadcast if the allegations are proved to be true.</description>

      <body>BBC Director General Tony Hall has said the BBC will broadcast a Panorama programme featuring allegations about Comic Relief, if they are true. Newspaper reports have claimed the investigation into several charities, is in danger of being "shelved". But Lord Hall told a parliamentary select committee he "very much" hoped it would be transmitted. He added: "I believe strongly in the BBC's ability to carry out investigative journalism." It was reported by The Mirror newspaper that the Panorama programme is looking into claims the charity has invested £150 million of its funds for up to eight years before passing money on to the causes for which it had been raised. There are also allegations that some of the money went to a fund which invested in tobacco firms and an arms company. Lord Hall is appearing before a Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee alongside Chairman of the BBC Trust, Lord Patten, to discuss the BBC's annual report. He was asked by Mr Philip Davies MP if the Panorama programme would be broadcast. "The thing I learned when I was last in the BBC… was that when you have a programme which is controversial, and right to be controversial, making big claims, and right to be making big claims, you shouldn't set a transmission date," said Lord Hall. He said programme makers "should set aside time" to talk to lawyers and check claims, adding "that's exactly what's happening with this programme." Lord Hall said he had discussed the programme directly with director of news, James Harding, adding "there's no string of BBC executives" making decisions about the programme. Comic Relief has called the claims "inaccurate" and "misleading". When pressed on whether the six-month investigation into charities' pay and investments would be broadcast, Lord Hall said: "I don't know yet. I very much hope this programme will be transmitted but I don't know yet what the substance of the allegations are, and whether they are right or wrong. "My aim is to get programmes on the air [and] I believe strongly in the BBC's ability to carry out investigative journalism." Lord Hall was asked by Ben Bradshaw MP if there were parallels with Newsnight's dropped Jimmy Savile investigation, and whether that was why staff had leaked the story to the press. "I don't know about the parallels," said Lord Hall. "This is a much clearer story which, if established, I think is a proper story to tell." "I've done a lot of programmes like this [in my previous career at the BBC]. We did all sorts of different stories. But what we needed from the journalists was to work through the implications of what they were saying and if they do that, they will have my complete support." Lord Hall added: "We are moving as quickly as we can." Both Lord Hall and Patten are appearing in front of the committee to discuss the findings of this year's BBC annual report, published in July this year. It revealed the BBC spent around £5m on three inquiries set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. The Pollard Review, which looked into Newsnight's dropped investigation into the presenter, cost £2.8m. The report also found public trust in the BBC had now almost recovered to previous levels, following the Savile and Newsnight crises. At the select committee hearing on Tuesday, Lord Hall was also questioned on the issue of bullying and harassment among staff at the BBC. The Respect at Work Review by Dinah Rose QC was published in May and suggested there was "a strong undercurrent of fear" at the BBC when addressing these issues. Lord Hall said the BBC had been working "very hard" on implementing the report's recommendations. "We are, this week, opening our first ever bullying and harassment support line to allow people to say if they think they are being bullied and harassed, and we are trying to deliver results on all the cases as quick as we can," he said. He confirmed a number of disciplinary hearings had been carried out and that in one case, the subject of the complaint was no longer working at the BBC. Lord Hall also stated that his new £150,000 cap on severance pay was "very real" and that it would be enforced on all of the 300 staff it applied to, despite around 20 senior managers disagreeing with the cap. When questioned on the issue of cuts to local radio by Tracey Crouch MP, Lord Hall agreed there was "a danger" of news being recycled as a result. However he added that he wanted to "be ambitious, with limited resources" with his plans for the BBC's 39 local stations. "There's a lot to do in partnership with local newspapers and other local organisations," he said, adding he wanted to do more to "reflect the quality of the arts, culture and other things going on in communities". </body>

      <title>Outfoxing the urban fox</title>
      <description>Many might want to do something about urban foxes in their area. There's an increasingly popular and humane way to outwit them.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24563919</url>
      <date>1382403985</date>

      <body>There are an estimated 33,000 urban foxes in the UK's towns and cities. Outwitting the wily creatures is becoming an increasingly popular way to control them humanely. There are many people who dislike urban foxes. They have been blamed for biting babies and killing penguins at London Zoo, but others feed them and treat them like pets. Foxes first colonised UK towns and cities in the 1940s and an estimated 33,000 now live in them, according to research by Bristol University. There are thought to be 16 per square mile in London alone. Dealing with urban foxes is complicated. They are protected under a series of wildlife laws and it is only permissible to control numbers in very limited ways. Even then methods such as shooting often aren't appropriate in urban areas. But there are a small number of fox experts specialising in dealing with them in ways that will not harm the animal. They call it "humane deterrence" and don't like to be labelled as pest controllers. They are getting up to 50 calls a week from people who need help but don't want the fox harmed. Killing foxes is pointless in urban areas, they argue, because another one will quickly take its place. Fox experts agree. "A fox will constantly mark its territory," says John Bryant, who is based in Tonbridge, Kent, and was one of the first people to offer humane deterrence. "The moment it stops it's obvious to others foxes that it isn't there any more and they will move in. So if you shoot a fox another will colonise the vacant territory in a matter of days." The humane approach is about disturbing a fox's normal behaviour and, crucially, moving it to another part of its territory. This means its scent will still be left around the area so no other foxes will move in. "Foxes repeat behaviour day after day but they are very smart and if an area becomes hostile they will move somewhere else," says Terry Woods, co-founder of Fox-A-Gon, which operates in London and the South East. A fox's territory can cover up to 40 acres and in urban areas can include up to 400 gardens, says Bryant. If you deter it from one garden it could have another 399 to choose from, he says. "It might only move to a garden a few doors down but that person might not think the fox is a problem. It's obviously going to return to a garden where it is welcome, not one where it isn't." Methods used are often simple. One of the most popular, and most effective, is motion-activated sprinklers that repel foxes with a short but startling burst of water. Underground cameras are also used to hunt out and block hidden routes that foxes use to get in an area. Brookside, a street in north London, typifies the divide of opinion there often is when it comes to urban foxes. One resident, Sofia, has chickens and worries they will be killed by foxes. She has used many methods to deter them, including human hair after reading on the internet that foxes don't like the smell. "It was a bit of a random request but my mum went to the hairdressers and asked for a bag of hair," she says. "I've wedged it in certain places but foxes have pulled it out. If a fox killed my chickens I'd be absolutely devastated." Nobby lives a few doors down and has been feeding local foxes for years, luring them into his garden with dog food and biscuits. "There are a lot of people round here that say 'you and your foxes are making a lot of noise and they're digging holes in my garden'. I tell them to go boil their heads." Common complaints about foxes can usually be narrowed down to mess, pungent-smelling faeces, digging holes and noise. They screech when they fight over territory or female foxes during mating season. But fox lovers point out that other animals, such as pet cats and dogs, are also responsible for such behaviour. Fox experts say there are many common myths surrounding foxes, including that they scavenge in bins every night and kill for fun. Both are untrue, they argue. Other people may beg to differ. Problems are often because of people and not foxes, say the experts. "You shouldn't encourage foxes into your home or try to tame them," says Stephen Harris, professor of environmental sciences at the University of Bristol and an expert on foxes. "They are incredibly intelligent but, just like people, they are all different. They will have different responses - some will be friendly but some won't." He says fox attacks are extremely rare but the animals do explore using their teeth and nip things to see what they are. "It's usually exploratory, inquisitive behaviour but you don't want to be on the receiving end. "Britain has some of the highest-density fox populations in the world but they cause remarkably few problems. There are many benefits of having foxes in urban areas, including being nature's pest controllers when it comes to rats and feral pigeons. "The vast majority of householders like to see the foxes in their garden. It's a bit of the countryside in town." But fox supporters do, however, recognise they can be a nuisance. Vixens give birth around March and the cubs are normally driven out to find their own territories by their parents in the late summer and autumn. "When the adolescent foxes are kicked out of home they become teenage hooligans," says Bryant. "They come down streets in gangs and cause trouble. I've known them to bite through the brake pipes on cars. It's very rare, but I have dealt with a few cases." But at the end of the day the argument for humane controls is simple, say those in the business. "We can't exist in isolation," says Woods. "Nature runs in harmony and foxes are an important part of the ecosystem. If you start taking out what you don't like - the squirrels, the foxes, the badgers - you end up with nothing."

      <title>Smashed Hits: The Windmills Of Your Mind</title>
      <description>The Windmills Of Your Mind was made famous by Noel Harrison, who's died aged 79. Why has it stood the test of time?</description>

      <body>"Round... like a circle in a circle, a wheel within a wheel..." so begins The Windmills Of Your Mind, made famous by Noel Harrison. Why has the song lasted so long, asks Ben Milne. Only two minutes and 20 seconds long in the version by Harrison, who's died aged 79, Windmills of Your Mind is a rush of lyrical free association about turning circles, spirals and the passage of time ("The autumn leaves were turning to the colour of her hair"). With its imagery of "a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own" and apples "whirling silently in space" Windmills occupies a singular place in the pop canon where psychedelia and easy listening meet. "It's a very peculiar and intriguing song," says Bob Stanley, musician and author of pop history Yeah Yeah Yeah. "It gets called easy listening but really isn't at all." Stanley says the song was the product of a short-lived era, post-Sgt Pepper, "where what had been the straight set... jumped on the psychedelia bandwagon". It was written by French composer Michel Legrand, with English lyrics by husband-and-wife team Alan and Marilyn Bergman (a French version, Les Moulins de mon coeur, was also penned by Eddy Marnay) and was used to memorable effect in the Steve McQueen thriller The Thomas Crown Affair (it won the Oscar for best song in 1968). But what do the lyrics mean? The poet Ian McMillan says Windmills Of Your Mind is similar to some modernist poetry where meanings are kept deliberately mysterious and confusing. He thinks the lyrics are deceptively shallow and warns poetry students not to use them as a template: "People will write something like 'the walls of my despair' or 'the settee of my soul'. 'Windmills of your mind' is a great phrase, and it's a fantastic song, but the words appear to mean something when they don't." Nevertheless the song has become a standard, covered by more than 80 recording artists, as diverse as Dusty Springfield, ex-Specials singer Terry Hall, the Muppets and Kiri Te Kanawa. But for many, it's Noel Harrison's version which still endures, as he delivers in his clipped English accent, "Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that she said?"

      <body>Five players at Premiership clubs tested positive for recreational drugs last season. In its annual anti-doping report, the Rugby Football Union said the cases would be treated confidentially and punished with a "first-strike fine". The tests came under the RFU's Illicit Drugs Programme, a series of out-of competition tests. In 617 tests for performance-enhancing drugs, none were failed by Premiership players. Testing for illicit drugs - cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines and ecstasy - was introduced in 2009 after four Bath players were suspended for substance use. The players who returned positive samples will be offered counselling and will remain anonymous unless they transgress again. Senior players who fail tests are fined £5,000, with a £1,000 fine given to academy players. "The RFU, Premiership Rugby and the Rugby Players' Association are focused on protecting the health and welfare of the players and reputation of the game, which is why this was set up in 2010," said an RFU statement. "We believe our strategy based on education, testing, deterrent and treatment will keep the number of test violations consistently low." Five players of National League One level or below failed in-competition tests aimed at performance-enhancing substances. </body>

      <body>Warren Gatland has named three uncapped players in Wales' autumn 2013 squad. They are Scarlets scrum-half Rhodri Williams, Cardiff Blues centre Cory Allen and Ospreys wing Eli Walker. Perpignan utility back James Hook and lock team-mate Luke Charteris return along with Scarlets fly-half Rhys Priestland. Jamie Roberts (ankle) is injured and Alex Cuthbert is out after suffering a leg injury in the Blues' Heineken Cup win over Toulon at the weekend. In-form Scarlet Scott Williams is tipped to fill that centre spot alongside Jonathan Davies while Walker's chances of a Test debut are boosted by British and Irish Lion Cuthbert's absence. Blues centre Owen Williams and fly-half Rhys Patchell stay involved at senior level having been among a host of fresh faces who drew their June Test series in Japan 1-1. Lions skipper Sam Warburton reclaims the Wales captaincy from fellow Blue Bradley Davies, who wore the armband in Japan. Scarlets hooker Emyr Phillips also remains, having toured Japan. Phillips' former Parc y Scarlets hooking rival, Matthew Rees, is out of contention as he is scheduled to undergo testicular surgery that has forced him to take time out from the game. Exeter Chiefs tight-head prop Craig Mitchell's bicep injury and Saracens loose-head Rhys Gill is also absent as he awaits shoulder reconstruction surgery. Ospreys tight-head prop Aaron Jarvis returns after recovering from a knee injury suffered during Wales' 2012 autumn series. Walker was named in Wales' 2013 Six Nations squad, but injuries forced him out and he also missed the trip to Japan. Blues centre Allen comes in after impressive early-season form, including a fine performance in their triumph over European champions Toulon. An unexpected consideration for Gatland was Lions scrum-half Mike Phillips having to go in front of the Bayonne board on Tuesday to answer allegations that he attended a video analysis session while under the influence of alcohol. If found guilty, the player could face a club suspension and fine, but that would not affect Phillips' Wales availability. However, the emergence of former Wales Under-20 scrum-half Williams is a big plus. The Ammanford product has won selection for Scarlets' Heineken Cup matches against Harlequins and Racing Metro ahead of two other promising number nines, Gareth Davies and Aled Davies. Wales' series kicks off against South Africa on 9 November, continuing against Argentina on 16 November, Tonga the following Friday, and against Australia eight days later on 30 November. Gatland said: "We have an important campaign ahead as we look to test ourselves against some of the best sides in the world but also add strength in depth to our squad as we look to the future. "We face a huge game against South Africa first up and they will be coming to us after an impressive Rugby Championship campaign. "Recent matches between us have been very close and physical and that will be a great test for us to kick-off. "All four matches will be a stern test but we are looking forward to the challenge and looking forward to seeing what we can do on this stage. "The Rugby World Cup is less than two years away, so we are looking to build as much depth in our squad as possible and to give vital international experience to our players." South Africa announce their squad on Monday, 28 October. Forwards: Scott Andrews (Cardiff Blues), Adam Jones (Ospreys), Aaron Jarvis (Ospreys), Paul James (Bath), Gethin Jenkins (Cardiff Blues), Ryan Bevington (Ospreys), Richard Hibbard (Ospreys), Ken Owens (Scarlets), Emyr Phillips (Scarlets), Alun Wyn Jones (Ospreys), Luke Charteris (Perpignan), Ian Evans (Ospreys), Bradley Davies (Cardiff Blues), Andrew Coombs (Dragons), Ryan Jones (Ospreys), Justin Tipuric (Ospreys), Sam Warburton (capt, Cardiff Blues), Toby Faletau (Dragons), Dan Lydiate (Racing Metro). Backs: Rhodri Williams (Scarlets), Mike Phillips (Bayonne), Lloyd Williams (Cardiff Blues), Dan Biggar (Ospreys), Rhys Patchell (Cardiff Blues), Rhys Priestland (Scarlets), Jon Davies (Scarlets), Ashley Beck (Ospreys), Scott Williams (Scarlets), Cory Allen (Cardiff Blues), Owen Williams (Cardiff Blues), James Hook (Perpignan), George North (Northampton Saints), Eli Walker (Ospreys), Leigh Halfpenny (Cardiff Blues), Liam Williams (Scarlets). </body>

      <description>Serena Williams powers past Angelique Kerber in her opening match at the WTA Championships in Istanbul.</description>

      <body>Serena Williams powered past Angelique Kerber in her opening match at the WTA Championships in Istanbul. The world number one broke the German's serve at the first opportunity in each set on the way to a 6-3 6-1 success. Second seed Victoria Azarenka was made to work hard for a 7-6 (7-4) 6-2 victory over Italian world number seven Sara Errani. Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska, seeded third, lost 6-4 6-4 to the Czech Republic's fifth seed Petra Kvitova. American Williams, already guaranteed to end the season on top of the world rankings, is aiming to become the first player to successfully defend the season-ending title since Justine Henin in 2007 and win a fourth crown overall. She was simply too strong for world number nine Kerber, conjuring 31 winners, but also mixing her game to win the point on each of the 14 occasions that she ventured to the net. "I feel really good," said Williams. "She's beaten me before so I was a little nervous and really focused. "I never usually say I'm happy about a match, but I am now and I'm excited about that. "It's such a tough tournament. Every match you have to be focused. I'm happy, but I have to get focused again." Williams's dominance was in contrast to the earlier struggles of Azarenka, who was 5-2 down to Errani in the first set before fighting back to take it on a tie-break in an hour and 28 minutes. Only when Errani called the trainer for treatment on a calf injury did matters become simpler for the Belarusian, with the two-time Australian Open champion winning the final four games to complete victory. Meanwhile, British number three Heather Watson claimed only a second win in two months with a hard-fought success over American Christina McHale at the ITF tournament in Poitiers, France. Watson, who reached a career-high ranking of 39 in February, has struggled since returning from a bout of glandular fever at the French Open in May and has slipped to 133. Dropping down from the WTA Tour to play one of the bigger events on the second tier, Watson lost the first set and, after fighting back, trailed 4-2 in the decider. But she won four successive games to come through 2-6 7-5 6-4. </body>

      <description>Olympic gold medallist Sir Ben Ainslie answers your questions about the America's Cup, Chinese food and his love of moths.</description>

      <body>Sir Ben Ainslie added another notable achievement to his legendary sailing career by helping Oracle Team USA fight back from 8-1 down to win the America's Cup last month. The victory over Team New Zealand continued Ainslie's success on water. He is the most decorated Olympic sailor with medals in five consecutive games, including a fourth gold at London 2012. Ainslie, 36, came ashore this week to answer questions posed by contributors to BBC Sport. Which provides the sterner test, your competitors or the sea? Edward Jones ‏@nejones_ That is a very good question. It is both. Sailing is about making the least mistakes and dealing with conditions and your competitors. It is a little bit like golf in that respect. You never sail a perfect race like you never play a perfect game of golf and normally the people who come out on top make the least mistakes. I would say sailing is probably more to do with dealing with the conditions as a competitor and secondly dealing with the competition. It can be very tactical, especially as the competition comes to the end of the event as you saw in the Olympics last year. You start realising who your main competition are towards the end of the event and you do focus on them more and at that point the racing is much more tactical. One of the dangers is you get too focused on one individual or one team and you forget about the conditions and what is happening outside the boat, with the wind and the water. You make a mistake and a rival sails past you. People often describe sailing as like chess on water because of the tactics of it. There is a lot of strategy involved and you have to be thinking the whole time about what the next move is. Was New Zealand's near-capsize in race eight the most identifiable moment when momentum of the America's Cup flipped to USA and you went on to win? De'Kurt La'Liedtke ‏@Keeerrrttt1 Definitely. That race was the first time we had shown some good upwind speed and previously that is where we had been weaker than the Kiwis and we actually surprised them a little bit. I don't know if that is necessarily why they had a bad tack and nearly capsized but we got back into them and won that race and for all of us on that boat it was a turning point. You've done match racing at every level, how about a Volvo around the world campaign? Henry Nicholson-Cole ‏@Henry_NC I love the Volvo race. My dad competed in the first ever around the world race, which back then was called the Whitbread Around the World Race, back in 1973. So growing up as a youngster I had all the stories around that, which was very inspiring. I have done quite a lot of offshore racing but I have not had the opportunity to try the Volvo - maybe it is something I can do in the future. The Olympics and the America's Cup have been my focus up until now in my career so the Volvo is something I have not had time to have a crack at. Have you ever thought of moving into the International Moths since seeing the hydro-foiling at the America's Cup? Alex Sharp ‏@SPAM_Official That is a very good point because certainly with the America's Cup with the foiling, when the boats are lifting up on the foils, is what moth sailing is all about. Those guys are leading the way in that style of sailing so in terms of training or preparation for the bigger America's Cup boats the moth is a very good tool. I can imagine I will be doing a lot of moth sailing in the coming years. The moths are so much fun to sail. It is like windsurfing, you are flying around at 40 miles an hour in a tiny little craft which is up on foils. They are very dynamic, very fast, a lot of fun. It is a totally different style of racing to what you see in, for example, the finn boat which I sailed in the Olympics. It is a new development of sailing and something that is a great training tool for the future. Since you support Chelsea, what do you think of their prospect this season with the return of the Special One? Sivan John ‏@SivanJohn I think their prospects are good. I am a big Jose Mourinho fan. It sounds like he has got himself into a little bit of trouble in the last week but I think that is all part of his game. I hope this time he can stay for a while and really build up a strong team again. His man-management is very good. The players you would want to have around you respond very well to him and have a lot of respect for him - guys like Frank Lampard for example. They have a tremendous working relationship and I think that is what you need as a manager, you need those key players around you that you can trust and they are going to help you build the squad. Why did you take up sailing? Jammy ‏@jammy_jnr My parents were keen on sailing. They didn't really race apart from that first Whitbread and from then on they sailed socially. They got my sister and me into it from a young age messing about on boats socially. I didn't really start racing until I was eight at my local sailing club Restronguet in Cornwall. I went one step at a time, I just enjoyed being on the water. Then a guy called Dr Phil Slater, whose kids were a similar age, started teaching us all to race and I took it from there. Why do you always have a Chinese meal before racing? Lucas Ramsey ‏@lucasramsey_ That is something I haven't done so much in recent years but when I was younger I was really into having a Chinese meal. It something I did with my parents when I was a youngster and we thought it was a lucky thing having a Chinese meal before an event started and it was a nice thing to do socially so we stuck with it for quite a number of years. My favourite dish is definitely spare ribs. Could you be tempted to compete in the Rio Olympics and what would it take? Phil Crawley @PhilCrawley I don't think so. I made that call last year to retire from Olympic sailing. London 2012 was such an amazing experience and I don't think you will ever top that in terms of Olympics and racing on home water. Also, I have other ambitions in racing with the America's Cup and perhaps some other races. I still think it is the right call. I am happy with that and of course I will support the next Olympic team 100%. Anything I can do to help I would love to. Other than your own achievement, what part of London 2012 did you most enjoy? Phil: @philclements The closing ceremony. It was a pretty stressful event for anyone competing at home. It was amazing the difference from competing in an Olympics away from home, where you train and then go into a little bubble and you just get on with it. Competing at home, the distractions were so much more it made it pretty difficult to prepare and stay focused and not get pulled from pillar to post. I loved watching other competitions. Halfway through my competition I wasn't doing particularly well at that point and I remember watching Helen Glover and Heather Stanning winning in the rowing doubles and then Bradley Wiggins smashing the time trial and that was really inspiring to see those results. That had helped a lot of us who were still competing to get motivated and be part of that winning team. London 2012 was probably the most pressurised situation I have been in. There were the external pressures because we were racing at home. Then internally, the chance to win a medal at home was huge. A fifth medal would have meant quite a lot in the history of sailing as well, so that was a huge amount of internal pressure to achieve that goal. It was a stressful period. Who was your most inspirational coach? And Why? Matt @MDGelly10 I have had some fantastic coaches over the years. I mentioned Phil Slater at a young age who made a huge difference. A guy called Jim Saltonstall, again when I was a youngster he was a huge character. He was a national coach. He helped a lot of the top sailors you have seen come through the Olympics. Iain Percy, Nick Rodgers, Paul Robertson, Shirley Robertson - all these guys were coached by Jim and he was a huge inspiration to our generation of sailors. Finally David Howlett who was my coach for two Olympics and this last one in London. A fantastic guy and certainly I wouldn't have achieved the last Olympics without his support. </body>

      <description>Roy Keane questions Sir Alex Ferguson's loyalty after the release of the ex-Manchester United's manager's autobiography.</description>

      <body>Roy Keane has questioned Sir Alex Ferguson's loyalty after comments made in the former Manchester United manager's autobiography. Former United captain Keane was strongly criticised in the book but told ITV: "I'm OK, quite relaxed. "I remember having conversations about loyalty when I was at the club. I don't think he knows the meaning of the word. "To constantly criticise other players that brought him success… I won't be losing any sleep over it." In his book, Ferguson claimed Irishman Keane, who played a key role in the club's success during his 12-year stay at Old Trafford, became an increasingly negative influence. The Scot wrote about Keane: "The hardest part of Roy's body is his tongue. He has the most savage tongue you can imagine. "He can debilitate the most confident person in the world in seconds. He was an intimidating, ferocious individual." Former Republic of Ireland midfielder Keane, 42, won seven Premier League titles, four FA Cups and the Champions League during his time at Old Trafford between 1993 and 2005. Ferguson also criticised other former United players including David Beckham, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Owen Hargreaves, as well as current Red Devils striker Wayne Rooney, in his new book, 'Alex Ferguson: My Autobiography'. Keane, who released his own autobiography in 2002, says such harsh judgements are unfair given the success and trophies he and his fellow players brought the club under Ferguson. "I just don't think the manager needs to do it. I'm not sure how many books he's written now," Keane said. "But he has to draw the line eventually and say, 'Listen, these players have all been top servants to Manchester United'. A lot of these players helped the manager win lots of trophies. "Imagine if we never won a trophy what he would have said. We brought success to the club, we gave it everything we had when we were there. "But, as I said, it's just part of modern life now. People like to do books and criticise their ex-players." Keane left United in November 2005 after 12 years at the club and joined Celtic in the January 2006 transfer window before retiring at the end of that season on medical advice. He then began a five-year managerial career at Sunderland and Ipswich Town, and has been an ITV football analyst since being sacked by Ipswich in January 2011.  </body>

      <body>A would-be bridegroom who made a hoax bomb threat to a wedding venue after realising he had failed to confirm his booking has been jailed. Neil McArdle, 36, of Medbourne Crescent, Liverpool, realised his error the day before he was due to marry at St George's Hall in the city in April. Rather than tell fiancee Amy Williams, he made a bomb-threat call from a phone box, Liverpool Crown Court heard. He was given a 12-month jail sentence after admitting making the hoax call. McArdle could not face telling Miss Williams, the "love of his life", that the big day "that was all she talked about" was not going to happen, the court heard. So as she got dressed on the morning of the wedding he slipped out of the house, went to a phone box and, disguising his voice, told the receptionist at Liverpool Register Office, which is part of St George's Hall: "This is not a hoax call. "There's a bomb in St George's Hall and it will go off in 45 minutes." The call, 11 days after the Boston Marathon bombing, provoked "terror" and the building was immediately evacuated and emergency services called. Miss Williams was left standing outside in her wedding dress with her mother and the rest of the wedding party. But his would-be in-laws were already suspicious, the court heard, and a row broke out with Miss Williams's sister telling a "flustered" McArdle: "You probably done the bomb scare yourself." Police quickly traced the call and McArdle was arrested the same day, admitting to his "embarrassment and shame" that he panicked and staged the bomb scare after bungling the wedding booking forms. He later pleaded guilty to communicating false information about a bomb hoax. Miss Williams has stood by the defendant, the court heard, and they are still together. Barrister Charles Lander, mitigating, said: "If it wasn't so serious the facts of this case have all the markings of a comedy." However, he said McArdle realised this was "no laughing matter". Judge Norman Wright said it was an "extremely serious" case, with custody the only appropriate sentence. </body>

      <body>A man whose car became embedded in the side of a house in Suffolk has been banned for two years after admitting drink-driving and careless driving. Lewis Richardson's Audi TT left the road in Carlton Colville, Lowestoft, and crashed into a family home. Lowestoft magistrates were told the impact early on 24 March was just below where a five-year-old was sleeping. The 22-year-old, of Lowestoft, was "extremely sorry" and still suffering from serious injuries, the court heard. He had driven his car after an argument with his girlfriend and was a man of previous good character, magistrates were told. Richardson, of Hidesley Court, had since been to the Long Meadow Walk house to apologise to the family. He has received treatment for speech and sight problems and depression. The court heard the girl who was asleep in the house at the time still suffers from sleep problems. Magistrates disqualified Richardson from driving and fined him £650. </body>

      <body>The Scottish government is trying to find a buyer for the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemicals plant. Scotland's Finance Secretary John Swinney said ministers had been having discussions "with other players". An ongoing dispute between owners Ineos and the union Unite has resulted in the plant being temporarily closed. Ineos has said it will make an announcement to workers on Wednesday on the future of the complex. UK ministers have held talks with Scottish ministers to discuss the situation. They urged both sides to get round the negotiating table. Grangemouth plays an important part in bringing ashore North Sea oil and supplies petrol and diesel to the whole of Scotland and the north of England. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Swinney said: "I don't think it will come as any surprise to anyone that the government is looking for alternative options and there certainly will be other players around the globe interested in this particular plant. "We have certainly had discussions with other players and the Scottish government will engage in any discussions that are helpful to ensure Grangemouth can continue to make a major contribution to the health and well-being of the Scottish economy." He added that government ownership was "not appropriate" and that there was a "buyer out there". Scottish Energy Minister Fergus Ewing joined talks by telephone on Tuesday afternoon with Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael and UK Energy Minister Michael Fallon. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Newsdrive programme, Mr Carmichael said: "There is a real imperative for them [Ineos and Unite] - not just for the future of the Grangemouth plant, but for the wider Scottish economy - to get back to the table, to get talking, to explore the issues that require to be explored in good faith and with a view to getting the plant operational as soon as possible. "Frankly nothing else is as important as that at the moment." The Scottish secretary also said both governments were making "contingency plans" for the Grangemouth site, if the owners decide not to reopen it. Senior figures from Ineos met in London earlier to discuss the outcome of their challenge to the workforce to accept reduced pay and pension. Responding to Mr Swinney's comments on talks about a takeover of the site, Declan Sealy, a director for Ineos at Grangemouth, said: "Like every business, we look at buying and selling assets and businesses all the time. "Our focus here today is on trying to implement a survival plan that brings a future for Grangemouth." However, it is not thought there has been any discussion with Ineos of a sale or a different operator. Unite said it would support the Scottish government in whatever way it could "to ensure a secure future for Grangemouth and its working community". The union's Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, said Mr Swinney's intervention was a "welcome" one. He added: "This site is so key to the Scottish economy, so key to the UK economy, it cannot be treated the way it is being treated. "It cannot be used in a Russian roulette type of way of 'we get what we want or we close this site down'. It is just so irresponsible and that type of behaviour cannot be tolerated. "This site cannot close, that's not an option and it does have a future, a really good, bright future." Unite said half of the 1,350-strong workforce had rejected Ineos' proposed change to contracts. The company gave employees until 18:00 on Monday to accept plans, including a pay freeze and downgrading of pensions. The union said the refusal of the workforce to accept the new contract terms was a mandate to return to talks and fire up the plant. It was shut down last week by Ineos in response to a strike threat over the disciplining of a union representative at the complex. Ineos had said the plant would close without new investment and changes to workers' terms and conditions. The firm said it would communicate the shareholders' views directly to the workforce on Wednesday. However, Ineos has warned a decision on the plant's fate could take several days. A spokesman added: "Ineos is now considering the numbers of employees that have given their support to its survival plan. "Consultations on the survival plan formally began last Thursday. It will take 45 days before any changes to terms and conditions can be introduced and 60 days before any changes to pensions can be implemented." Majority shareholder Jim Ratcliffe has said if the petro-chemical plant goes, the neighbouring refinery is unlikely to survive. He has also said Ineos may not be willing to pay the cost of a prolonged shutdown. Finance Secretary Mr Swinney repeated the Scottish government's calls for the firm to "fire up the plant" and urged both sides to avoid "the clear danger of a stalemate". He added: "The trade union has given, in my estimation, a very clear and unequivocal commitment that there will be no industrial action this side of Christmas, and indeed last night the union said there would be no strike action well into 2014. "I think we should take these commitments at face value, accept them, and get the plant operating again." The refinery, which has an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes, provides most of the fuel in Scotland, Northern England and Northern Ireland. The petrochemicals facility at the site manufactures more than two million tonnes of chemical products per year, which are later transformed into essential items such as bottles and pipes, cabling and insulation and food packaging. </body>

      <body>Police have issued a facial reconstruction image in a bid to identify a man whose badly-decomposed body was found in Glasgow. The body was found in woods near Golf Course Road, at Glen Orchard Road, Balmore, on 19 October 2011. It may have been there for six to nine months. There were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the man's death. Despite previous appeals and extensive inquiries, police have, so far, been unable to establish his identity. The man was described as white, between 20 and 35 years old and between 5ft 8in and 6ft 1in tall, with light brown hair. He was wearing a light-blue polo shirt from Topshop, a blue jacket with a knitted white band around the collar. It has "Southern Green Pennsylvania" motif written on the left side of the chest. He was also wearing blue jeans and dark training shoes. Det Sgt Kerr Duncan, who has worked on the inquiry, said: "Sadly, despite previous appeals and extensive police enquiries carried out, this man has not been identified. "I hope that the images released today of a facial reconstruction and the man's clothing will jog someone's memory, and finally we may be able to find out who this man is and contact his family." Anyone with information is asked to contact police. The facial reconstruction image was produced by a team of forensic anthropologists at Dundee University's Centre for Anatomy and Human Identification. </body>

      <title>Poots cannot appeal adoption ruling</title>
      <description>The health minister cannot appeal the high court's decision to allow gay and unmarried couple in Northern Ireland to adopt.</description>

      <body>The health minister cannot appeal the high court's decision to allow gay and unmarried couples in Northern Ireland to adopt. The Supreme Court said the Department of Health's argument for appeal did not meet the criteria. In June, the Court of Appeal ruled that legislation that prevents civil partners adopting was unlawful - but Edwin Poots appealed that decision. The Supreme Court said there were no grounds for an appeal and dismissed it. Mr Poots tried to challenge an appeal court's decision that paved the way for gay and lesbian couples to adopt children in Northern Ireland. A spokesman for the UK's top court said: "The Supreme Court of the UK has refused permission to appeal the Court of Appeal's decision in this matter." At present a single gay or lesbian person can adopt in Northern Ireland but a couple in a civil partnership cannot. Mr Poots said: "It is with disappointment that I note that the request for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused. "I am currently carefully considering the implications for the Adoption and Children Bill, which is currently being drafted and which I intend to introduce in the assembly next year." A challenge to the legislation was mounted by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, which was backed by an unidentified lesbian woman who wants to enter into a civil partnership and be able to adopt her partner's biological child. Unmarried couples in Great Britain can apply jointly to be considered for adoption irrespective of sexual orientation. But anyone unmarried in Northern Ireland is only eligible for consideration as an individual. Those in civil partnerships cannot apply individually or as a couple. The commission challenged the law on the grounds that certain provisions were unjustifiably discriminatory to those in homosexual relationships, in contravention of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Court of Appeal in Belfast ruled in the commission's favour and against Mr Poots' department in June. The department then applied for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court on a point of law. The Supreme Court spokesman added: "The Supreme Court issued an order on 22 October 2013 stating that the application did not satisfy the criteria of raising an arguable point of law of general public importance." The refusal of the Supreme Court in London to grant the further appeal on adoption law was welcomed by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. Chief Commissioner, Professor Michael O'Flaherty said: "The commission brought this case to ensure that the best interests of children in Northern Ireland would be protected. "Unmarried couples, those in same sex relationships and civil partnerships are eligible to be considered to be adoptive parents. "All of the judgements and today's rejection by the Supreme Court to hear a further appeal confirmed that the law in Northern Ireland was out of step with the United Kingdom's human rights obligations." Alliance Party MLA Kieran McCarthy said: "Edwin Poots' position as health minister has been seriously undermined by successive legal failures over adoption by civil partners and the ban on gay men donating blood. "He has continued to waste public money on his own personal campaigns despite several failures in the courts. "The minister must do what is right and urgently allow civil partners the opportunity to apply to adopt. He must accept this decision and cease any further legal action. "There are too many children in our care system for us to be deciding who has the right to apply to adopt a child. It should be about whether a couple can provide a loving and safe home for a child." Sinn Fein MLA Maeve McLaughlin who is the chair of the Health Committee has called on the minister to reveal how much money has been spent on the legal challenge. "This is a sensible and logical decision and one that will be welcomed widely. It is a decision that is against discrimination and for equality," she said. The Green Party leader Steven Agnew added that the minister had "over-stepped his legislative boundaries". "Surely questions must now be asked about his competency as a minister especially since his continual trips to court to try to push his own agenda is at the expense of the public purse," he said. The SDLP have said the policy around adoption needs to be "immediately rectified". "The Minister must confirm that legislation will now be brought forward to rectify this situation. I believe not to do so would mean that the Minister is not fulfilling the requirements of his office and he would be left with no alternative but to depart that office," said Alex Attwood. The Rainbow Project said they hoped the ruling would bring an end to the "discriminatory practice" in Northern Ireland. </body>

      <body>One of the world's leading art events, the Turner Prize exhibition, has been launched in Northern Ireland, the first time it has been held out of England. The exhibition will open to the general public on Wednesday morning at former Army barracks in Ebrington, Derry. Derry/Londonderry is the UK City of Culture 2013. Four artists are in contention for the award. The winner will receive £25,000 and the result will be announced on 2 December. Director of Tate Britain, Penelope Curtis, said: "Derry was an obvious place to bring the Turner Prize with it being the City of Culture year. "We wanted the Turner Prize to be more diverse and Derry was the right place. "London gets lots of contemporary art but Derry gets less. "Bringing it to the barracks seemed quite a controversial decision at the start but Derry feels very different now after my first visit 20 years ago. "This is the most diverse Turner Prize ever put on and this is a real chance for being part of history." Journalists from across the world descended on Derry for a preview on Tuesday morning. Chief Executive of the Culture Company, Shona McCarthy, said: "This is absolutely amazing for the city. "This is a world class gallery space at Ebrington Square. "It's exciting for our young people to have this in their city." The other shortlisted artists will each receive £5,000. Derry born artist Willie Doherty said: "We have reached the main point of the year in my eyes. "I'm not convinced that this space at Ebrington should be turned into an office space. "We need to keep this as an art gallery." Established in 1984, the Turner Prize is awarded to a contemporary artist under 50, living, working or born in Britain, who is judged to have put on the best exhibition of the last 12 months. Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, who lives and works in London, is shortlisted for her Extracts and Verses exhibition at the Chisenhale Gallery. She is of Ghanaian descent and is the first black woman to be in contention for the award. Glasgow-based David Shrigley is best known for his humorous line drawings, but also makes sculptures, photographs, paintings and animated films. His work, which combines jokes and commentary, can be found on greetings cards, in books and in magazines, as well as in galleries. Born in Lille in 1978, Laure Prouvost won the fourth Max Mara art prize for women in 2011 for her short films and installation work. Based in London, she is shortlisted for her new work Wantee, featured in Tate Britain's Schwitters in Britain exhibition, and her two-part Max Mara art prize installation. Born in 1976 and based in Berlin, Tino Sehgal has been shortlisted for his "pioneering" projects This Variation and These Associations. The latter, staged last year at Tate Modern in London, invited the public to interact with volunteers in a "live installation" staged in the gallery's expansive Turbine Hall. </body>

      <title>Jones backs halting winter surgery</title>
      <description>First Minister Carwyn Jones backs plans to suspend some non-urgent surgery in four hospitals in mid and west Wales over the winter.</description>

      <body>First Minister Carwyn Jones has backed a health board's plan to postpone some non-urgent surgery at mid and west Wales hospitals this winter. Hywel Dda Health Board said on Monday that certain orthopaedic schedules would be cancelled for a period of time while it dealt with increased pressure. The hospitals affected are in Carmarthen, Haverfordwest, Llanelli and Aberystwyth. Conservatives said the move would have a "massive impact" on patients. The health board said it would review its plans "towards the end of the winter surge". QandA: Hywel Dda Health Board on halting operations The health service union Unison has criticised the move and said that for patients it would result in longer delays and cause "further distress and possibly further complications to their condition". Mr Jones faced close questioning from each of the three other party leaders at First Minister's Question Time on Tuesday at the Senedd. Mr Jones told Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood: "Hywel Dda is doing exactly what her party has called for - that is planning for winter pressures. "It is wholly wrong to say the health board is cancelling all non-urgent elective orthopaedic surgery. "Those who've been scheduled to have orthopaedic surgery will receive it, all cancer, urgent trauma and day surgery work will continue." But in response Ms Wood said Hywel Dda had a waiting time of 15 months for orthopaedic surgery and she urged the first minister "take responsibility" for NHS delays. "Are you aware of the level of outrage amongst clinicians at Hywel Dda, who've been told that they're having a third of their work taken away from them this winter?" she said. Mr Jones told Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams he was informed about the health board's plans the day before it announced them. Ms Williams replied: "It seems that you're not very clear about the LHBs plans for this winter, your government isn't very clear about the LHBs plans for this winter and the public and the clinicians, it seems, are not very clear either." Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said it showed "the government is detached from the reality of what many patients and clinicians are experiencing within the Welsh NHS". Mr Davies questioned whether Welsh ministers were "in the loop" as operations that would have otherwise been scheduled were now being cancelled, decisions that would have a "massive impact on the patient experience and also the ability of that health board to retain its key clinicians". He accused the first minister of being "flippant" in the face of such serious proposals and warned of the dangers of a "crisis situation" developing over the next five months. Mr Jones said Mr Davies was "either setting out to be disingenuous" or wasn't listening to his replies and insisted that what the Conservative leader was suggesting would actually cause a crisis situation. Meanwhile other health boards in Wales have outlined their strategies for coping with winter pressures to BBC Wales. Three boards - Cardiff and Vale, Abertawe Bro Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan - said they would open extra beds, with Aneurin Bevan also promising extra staff. The Cwm Taf and Betsi Cadwaladr boards said they would work with the ambulance service and local councils to minimise the impact on hospitals. Betsi Cadwaladr officials added that the three main hospitals serving north Wales would concentrate on emergencies while non-urgent surgery would be handled by other units. </body>

      <title>Hospital's bid to move travellers</title>
      <description>Health bosses vow to launch legal proceedings to move French travellers blocking workers from parking at a hospital.</description>

      <body>Health bosses have vowed to launch legal proceedings to move French travellers who are blocking a car park used by hospital workers. Officials had asked the travellers to move 13 caravans from the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport by 16:00 BST on Tuesday. However the travellers - who are taking up 65 spaces - said they would not leave until Wednesday. The travellers arrived at the 300-space car park late Saturday on afternoon. Surgeons, doctors and nurses were turned away on Monday, but a hospital spokesman said patient services had not been disrupted. After visiting the site on Tuesday morning, Jamie Marchant, director of facilities at the Aneurin Bevan Health Board, told BBC Radio Wales: "I have spoken to a few of the travellers and they're very friendly and very amicable. "They have indicated to us previously that they are moving on tomorrow [Wednesday]. "They've also indicated they are parked up for a funeral." After the Tuesday afternoon deadline passed, Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, which runs the hospital, said it was now resorting to the law. "As you will be aware, the health board has requested that the travellers leave our hospital car park by 4pm today," a board member said. "Given that the travellers are still here following our request, the health board confirms that it will now be taking legal proceedings to take back possession of the hospital car park." Julian Hayman, a spokesman for the hospital, said security staff would remain in the car park and that the situation would continue to be monitored. He added it was hoped the travellers would leave of their own accord without the need for potentially costly legal proceedings. "However, this has been passed to our legal department now and it will be dealing with the situation from here," he said. </body>

      <description>Mozambique's opposition Renamo attacks a police station in the central town of Maringue a day after annulling a 1992 peace accord, officials say.</description>

      <body>Mozambique's opposition Renamo movement has attacked a police station in the central town of Maringue a day after annulling a 1992 peace accord with the government, officials say. Police are said to have fled their posts after gunmen opened fire and there are no reports of casualties. A Renamo spokesman said party leader Afonso Dhlakama had "lost control of the situation". On Monday, the army captured Mr Dhlakama's base, forcing him to flee. About a million people were killed in Mozambique's civil war. The conflict ended in 1992 when Renamo and the Frelimo government signed a peace accord. After the seizure of Mr Dhlakama's Sathunjira base on Monday, Renamo said it had pulled out of the peace deal. However, its 51 MPs have not withdrawn from parliament. The clashes have raised fears among many Mozambicans that the civil war could resume, threatening stability and the economic boom the southern Africa state is currently experiencing, reports the BBC's Jose Tembe from the capital, Maputo. However, some people trust the army, he adds. Mozambique's President Armando Guebuza addressed rallies in central Mozambique on Tuesday, urging people to remain calm. State-run Radio Mozambique quoted a police source as saying that Renamo fighters attacked the police station in Maringue, about 35km (20 miles) from Mr Dhlakama's former base in central Sofala province. The attack was intense, but there were no casualties, Radio Mozambique reported. A teacher in Meringue, Romao Martins, told AFP news agency that residents had fled their homes during the assault. Schools have also shut amid fears that the violence could escalate, AFP reports. "The situation is horrible here. Early this morning, armed men supposed to be Renamo, attacked and it was a mess," Mr Martins is quoted as saying. "For one hour, shooting could be heard from all directions and people fled from their homes." On Monday, defence ministry spokesman Cristovao Chume said government forces had taken control of Mr Dhlakama's base in response to an earlier attack on an army post by Renamo fighters. He confirmed that Mr Dhlakama had fled. Renamo spokesman Fernando Mazanga said that government soldiers had bombarded the Sathunjira base with heavy weapons before occupying it. "Peace is over in the country... The responsibility lies with the Frelimo government because they didn't want to listen to Renamo's grievances," Mr Mazanga told Reuters news agency. Our correspondent says it is unclear whether Renamo intends to withdraw its members from parliament. A Renamo MP told him that no official position had as yet been taken, he adds. The government has repeatedly accused Renamo of trying to drag the country back to war, an allegation it denies. In April, at least five people were killed in central Mozambique after Renamo members attacked a police post. A force of about 300 Renamo men has remained armed since the peace accord, despite efforts to integrate them into the army or police force. Mr Dhlakama has said he needs his own personal bodyguards, and the men usually stay in his war-time camp in the Gorongosa mountains in centre of the country. After the civil war ended, Mr Dhlakama moved out of the camp to live in Maputo and later in the northern Nampula province But he returned to the mountains last year, saying he needed to be close to his men who were feeling ignored. Mozambique is due to hold local elections in November, and presidential and parliamentary elections next year. Frelimo has governed Mozambique since independence in 1975. Renamo, which was formed around the same time, was backed by the white minority governments in neighbouring South Africa and what is now Zimbabwe. </body>

      <body>A brigade of former rebels in the Libyan city of Benghazi has detained several people they say carried out recent car bombings in the city. Most of those held are foreigners, including several from Chad. But a military source told the BBC that the brigade had no official authority, and had made the arrests in an effort to show that it could provide security. Benghazi has seen frequent bombings and assassinations since Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in an uprising in 2011. Libya is due to mark the second anniversary of the former leader's fall on Wednesday. The arrests were made on Monday by the Martyrs' brigade of Libya, said Abdullah al-Zaidi of the Benghazi Joint Operations Room - a security force set up jointly by the ministries of defence and interior. The brigade is essentially a militia made up of former rebels against Gaddafi's rule, the BBC's Rana Jawad reports from the capital, Tripoli. Mr Zaidi said those held were part of a network and that they had confessed to at least 15 car bombings in the eastern city. A local TV station showed three people reported to be from neighbouring Chad standing against a wall following their detention. They were said to be mercenaries recruited by Gaddafi supporters. Mr Zaidi has given conflicting accounts on the number of people arrested and their nationalities in the past 24 hours. The Libyan military source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, called the arrests a "theatrical act". "These armed groups are trying to show that... they can replace the army," he said. "They sacrificed migrant workers for their propaganda. "Most of the perpetrators of these attacks are known to us and by the people, but the officials don't want to say... There is a fear of announcing who is behind all this." No-one has yet said they carried out the recent attacks in Benghazi. On average, there has been one attack every week. On social media, some Libyans suggested that the arrests might be a cover up for local groups, including hardline Islamists who are widely suspected of being responsible for much of the violence. </body>

      <description>The US defends its drone strikes in Yemen and Pakistan, as Pakistan's PM urges Washington to end the unmanned raids in his country.</description>

      <body>The US has defended its drone strikes in Yemen and Pakistan, saying it takes "extraordinary care" to ensure they comply with international law. The unmanned raids targeting terror suspects were a "course of action least likely to result in the loss of innocent life", the White House said. It follows allegations by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International of the unlawful killing of civilians. Pakistan's PM on Tuesday urged the US to end drone attacks in his country. Speaking at the start of a visit to the US, Nawaz Sharif said the attacks violated his country's sovereignty. He added that the raids were a "major irritant" in relations with Washington. Drone warfare has become common in the US pursuit of al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Few details are known about these covert operations, which are directed remotely from control rooms, often on other continents. Senior militant leaders have been killed but civilians have also died, causing outrage in Pakistan, where many assert that the strikes cause indiscriminate deaths and injuries. In a new report released on Tuesday, Amnesty said it reviewed nine of 45 recent drone strikes in North Waziristan and found a number of victims were unarmed. In a separate report looking at six US attacks in Yemen, Human Rights Watch says two of them killed civilians at random, violating international law. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Washington was "reviewing the reports carefully". "To the extent these reports claim that the US has acted contrary to international law, we would strongly disagree. "The administration has repeatedly emphasised the extraordinary care that we take to make sure counter-terrorism actions are in accordance with all applicable law," he said. In the report, Will I Be Next? US Drone Strikes in Pakistan, Amnesty called on the US to disclose information and the legal basis for strikes carried out in Pakistan. It said US President Barack Obama's pledge earlier this year to increase transparency around drone strikes had not been fulfilled. It called on the governments of Pakistan, Australia, Germany and the UK to investigate drone strikes or other abuses that may constitute human rights violations. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch said in its report that six US drone attacks in Yemen had killed 82 people, including at least 57 civilians. It added that two of the strikes killed innocent people indiscriminately. Last week, a UN investigation found that US drone strikes had killed at least 400 civilians in Pakistan, far more than the US has ever acknowledged. UN special rapporteur Ben Emmerson accused the US of challenging international legal norms by advocating the use of lethal force outside war zones. A controversial aspect of the US policy is that drone attacks are carried out not by the military but by the Central Intelligence Agency. US Defence Secretary Leon Panetta has argued in favour of the policy, saying that the US will continue to defend itself. President Obama has insisted the strategy was "kept on a very tight leash" and that without the drones, the US would have had to resort to "more intrusive military action". </body>

The fires near the Blue Mountains had been "tactically joined" to stop them merging with a third, officials say. Teams are engaged in extensive back-burning operations across the state ahead of worsening conditions expected on Wednesday. On Tuesday morning more than 60 blazes were still alight, with 13 uncontained. The region experienced light rain but firefighters say this will not be enough to quench the fires. New South Wales declared a state of emergency on Sunday amid some of the region's worst fires in years. On Monday fire officials feared that three blazes in the Blue Mountains area near Lithgow - at State Mine, Mount Victoria and Springwood - could link up, creating a massive fire. But NSW Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said that joining two of the fires had prevented them linking up with the third. "We are seeing positive results of these very deliberate, very targeted, very decisive strategies being deployed particularly in relation to back-burning operations... particularly in light of [Wednesday's] weather conditions," he said. Back-burning is controlled burning of key areas aimed at depriving a fire of fuel and prevent it travelling in a certain direction. The fire at State Mine has been downgraded to "watch and act" - from "emergency" - after some light rain at the fire zone. However, Mr Fitzsimmons added that "there's still a way to go" and that firefighters would be braced for higher temperatures and stronger winds expected on Wednesday. "We have got now probably 24 hours before we see the worst of the weather starting to develop and build across all these fire ground areas," he said. The conditions on Wednesday would be "about as bad as it gets". NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell told the BBC: "Tomorrow Wednesday in Sydney is expected to be the critical day when weather conditions return to what they were like last Thursday when these fires first started." "Whilst we've lost more than 200 properties [and] another 100 or so damaged, many thousands have been saved by the efforts of our volunteer and other fire fighters who've done a tremendous job for almost a week." Many families have their bags packed and are watching anxiously in case they are forced to flee, the BBC's Jon Donnison in the Blue Mountains reports. In parts of Sydney that has been shrouded in a smoky haze for much of the week air quality levels are reported to have been up to 50 times worse than normal, our correspondent adds. All schools in the Blue Mountains will be closed on Wednesday. One man has died - possibly of a heart attack - while trying to protect his home. Hundreds of people have been left homeless by the bushfires. On Monday, an 11-year-old boy in the Port Stephens area was charged with deliberately lighting two fires on 13 October. Another boy, 15, was also arrested over the fires, reports said. Amid debate over the causes of the fires in Australia, United Nations climate chief Christiana Figueres told US broadcaster CNN bushfires were "absolutely" linked to global warming, hitting out at Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's decision to repeal the carbon tax. "We are really already paying the price of carbon," she said. "We are paying the price with wildfires, we are paying the price with droughts." Mr Abbott has drafted legislation to repeal the carbon tax, introduced under the previous Labor government, which imposed a levy on the country's 300 biggest polluters. The new prime minister, who says the tax cost jobs and forced energy prices up, wants to introduce a Direct Action plan under which farmers and industry will be paid to act to reduce emissions.

      <title>US agency 'hacked French diplomats'</title>
      <description>New revelations in Le Monde newspaper allege the US National Security Agency spied on French diplomats in Washington and at the UN.</description>

      <body>The US National Security Agency has spied on French diplomats in Washington and at the UN, according to the latest claims in Le Monde newspaper. NSA internal memos obtained by Le Monde detailed the use of a sophisticated surveillance programme, known as Genie. US spies allegedly hacked foreign networks, introducing the spyware into the software, routers and firewalls of millions of machines. It comes a day after claims the NSA tapped millions of phones in France. The details in the latest Le Monde article are based on leaks from ex-intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, through Glen Greenwald, the outgoing Guardian journalist, who is feeding the material from Brazil, says the BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris. It comes on the day the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, is in London meeting foreign counterparts to discuss Syria. The Le Monde report sets out details of Genie, an NSA surveillance programme in which spyware implants were introduced remotely to overseas computers, including foreign embassies. It claims bugs were introduced to the French Embassy in Washington (under a code name "Wabash") and to the computers of the French delegation at the UN, codenamed "Blackfoot". The article suggests that in 2011, the US allocated $652m (£402m) in funding for the programme, which was spent on "spy implants". Tens of millions of computers were reported to have been hacked that year. A document dated August 2010 suggests intelligence stolen from foreign embassy computers ensured the US knew ahead of time the positions of other Security Council members, before a UN vote for a resolution imposing new sanctions on Iran. The US was worried the French were drifting to the Brazilian side - who were opposed to implementing sanctions - when in truth they were always aligned to the US position, says our correspondent. The intelligence agency quotes Susan Rice, then-US ambassador to the UN, who praises the work done by the NSA: "It helped me know... the truth, and reveal other [countries'] positions on sanctions, allowing us to keep one step ahead in the negotiations." On Monday, Le Monde alleged that the NSA spied on 70.3 million phone calls in France between 10 December 2012 and 8 January 2013. At a breakfast meeting with the US secretary of state on Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius demanded a full explanation. Referring to a telephone call between the French and US presidents, Mr Fabius told reporters: "I said again to John Kerry what Francois Hollande told Barack Obama, that this kind of spying conducted on a large scale by the Americans on its allies is something that is unacceptable." Asked if France was considering reprisals against the US, government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem replied: "It is up to Foreign Minister Fabius to decide what line we take but I don't think there is any need for an escalation. "We have to have a respectful relationship between partners, between allies. Our confidence in that has been hit but it is after all a very close, individual relationship that we have." Both French officials made their comments before the latest revelations appeared in Le Monde. Mr Snowden, a former NSA worker, went public with revelations about US spying operations in June. The information he leaked led to claims of systematic spying by the NSA and CIA on a global scale. Targets included rivals like China and Russia, as well as allies like the EU and Brazil. The NSA was also forced to admit it had captured email and phone data from millions of Americans. Mr Snowden is currently in Russia, where he was granted a year-long visa after making an asylum application. The US wants him extradited to face trial on criminal charges. </body>

      <title>Eta convict freed after court ruling</title>
      <description>Spain's high court sets a convicted Basque militant free, after a European court rules that prison work should have contributed to her early release.</description>

      <body>A convicted Basque militant has been freed after the Spanish authorities upheld a European Court of Human Rights ruling against her continued detention. Ines Del Rio, of the separatist group Eta, had been serving a 30-year sentence for bomb attacks in the 1980s. Spain's High Court had earlier backed the Strasbourg court's ruling against Spanish laws that denied her right to earn remission through prison work. Spain says dozens of Eta prisoners could now be eligible for release. Ines del Rio left the Teixeiro prison in A Coruna in north-west Spain at 16:25 local time (14:25 GMT). Monday's ruling by the European Court of Human Rights "gives us no choice", concluded a prosecutors' report at the High Court requesting Del Rio's immediate release, reported El Pais newspaper. The penal chamber subsequently ordered her immediate release. Groups representing victims of Eta's bloody four-decade campaign for independence for regions of northern Spain and south-west France denounced the Strasbourg ruling in protests on Monday, while supporters of the prisoners held marches in favour. Eta declared an end to its armed campaign in 2011. Del Rio was arrested in 1987 for her part in 23 murders and car bombings carried out by Eta. She was later sentenced to more than 3,800 years in jail, but the criminal code in force at the time reduced this to a maximum stay of 30 years. Del Rio earned sentence reductions through prison work, making her eligible for release in July 2008 - but two years earlier the High Court applied what is known as the "Parot doctrine" to extend her detention. Under this doctrine, sentence reductions are applied to the sentences for individual crimes - collectively amounting to 3,828 years - rather than the overall 30-year maximum stay. It meant Del Rio's release would be postponed until 2017. But on Monday the European Court of Human Rights, upholding a July 2012 ruling in favour of Del Rio, condemned Spain for this practice and ordered Spain to ensure her immediate release and to pay her 30,000 euros (£25,400; $41,000) in compensation. Although the Strasbourg court's ruling only applies to Del Rio, the Spanish government says dozens of other convicted Eta members could be eligible for release. </body>

      <title>Cuba to scrap two-currency system</title>

      <body>Cuba is to scrap its two-currency system in the latest financial reform rolled out by President Raul Castro, official media report. Since 1994 Cuba has had two currencies, one pegged to the US dollar and the other worth only a fraction of that. The more valuable convertible peso (CUC) was reserved for use in the tourism sector and foreign trade. Now its value will be gradually unified with the lower-value CUP, ending a system resented by ordinary Cubans. The Cuban economy is almost entirely state-run and the tourism sector has boomed since the collapse of the Soviet Union plunged Cuba into economic isolation and hardship. The two-currency system was supposed to protect Cuba's fragile economy but angered locals paid in the much lower-value CUP and denied access to goods only available for those with convertible pesos. The policy exacerbated the creation of a two-tier class system in Cuba which divided privileged Cubans with access to the lucrative tourist and foreign-trade sectors from those working in the local economy - all-too-visibly contradicting Cuba's supposedly egalitarian society. The council of ministers has approved a timetable for implementing "measures that will lead to monetary and exchange unification", the official Communist Party newspaper Granma said. Unification is "imperative to guarantee the re-establishment of the Cuban peso's value and its role as money, that is as a unit of accounting, means of payment and savings", it said. It gave no details of how quickly the change would be implemented, though Reuters news agency quoted Cuban economists as saying it would take about 18 months. </body>

      <title>Hurricane Raymond prompts evacuation</title>

      <body>Hundreds of people have been evacuated from coastal communities in western Mexico that could lay in the path of Hurricane Raymond. Raymond is currently stalled some 135km (85 miles) off Mexico's Pacific coast and has weakened to a category 2 hurricane. But the authorities asked locals not to let their guard down as heavy rains continued and could set off landslides. A hurricane warning remains in place from Tecpan to Lazaro Cardenas. Torrential rains are forecast to continue for the next 24 hours in the western states of Guerrero and Michoacan. The area is still struggling to recover after it was hit by Tropical Storm Manuel last month. Manuel and Ingrid, another storm which hit Mexico almost at the same time, left more than 150 people dead and caused billions of dollars of damage. The governor of Guerrero state, Angel Aguirre, warned that Raymond's movements were "erratic" and "completely unpredictable" and could still head towards the coast. More than 1,000 people have been evacuated from villages clinging to perilous hillsides and schools remained closed for some 35,000 pupils. In the aftermath of Tropical Storm Manuel an entire village was buried under a landslide in the mountains of Guerrero, and the memory of that disaster has made locals more wary. A resident of Zihuatanejo, where forecasters said Raymond could make landfall, told the Agence France-Presse news agency she was not taking any chances. "When I heard the mayor's warning on the radio, I didn't hesitate, I grabbed my children and went down in a civil protection truck," Bartola Hernandez said. </body>

      <description>A Palestinian militant suspected of planning a 2012 bombing in Tel Aviv has been shot dead by Israeli troops in the West Bank, the Israeli army says.</description>

      <body>A Palestinian militant has been shot dead by Israeli troops in the West Bank, the Israeli army has said. Mohammad Assi, a member of Islamic Jihad, was killed during a gunfight near the village of Bilin, army spokesman Lt Col Peter Lerner said. Assi reportedly exchanged fire for several hours with the soldiers from a cave after escaping an arrest raid. He was suspected of planning a bomb attack on a bus in Tel Aviv on 21 November 2012 that injured 29 people. The attack happened at the end of an eight-day conflict between Israel and militants in the Gaza Strip. "Mohammed Assi was hiding out in various places over the last year trying to avoid detection. This morning his running came to an abrupt end," Col Lerner wrote on Twitter. Israel Radio reported that two associates were arrested in the initial Israeli operation in Bilin in the early hours of Tuesday morning, but that Assi escaped and sought refuge in a nearby cage. The troops surrounded the cave for a number of hours, during which there were exchanges of fire. At one point, a rocket-propelled grenade was launched at the troops, according to Israel Radio. Assi was eventually shot after refusing calls to surrender, it added. Islamic Jihad said he had been one of its members, and that he was "assassinated by the occupation in Kufr Nemeh", a village near Bilin. Two months ago, three Palestinians were shot dead in clashes that erupted when Israeli troops tried to detain a suspect in the Qalandiya refugee camp. </body>

      <description>Egyptian prosecutors refer four police to trial for the manslaughter of 37 Islamist detainees who died when tear gas was fired into a transport vehicle.</description>

      <body>Egypt's state prosecutor has referred four policemen to trial over the deaths of 37 Islamist detainees in August. The officers, including the deputy chief of a Cairo police station, have been charged with manslaughter. The detainees died as a result of suffocation when tear gas was fired into the back of a vehicle transporting 45 of them to a prison outside Cairo. Security officials initially said they had tried to escape, but prosecutors found no evidence to support the claim. The incident sparked international condemnation, with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon saying he was "deeply disturbed" by the deaths and calling for a "full investigation". It took place four days after hundreds of people were killed when security forces cleared two sit-ins in the capital by supporters of President Mohammed Morsi, who was ousted by the military in July. Thousands of Islamists have since been detained, including Mr Morsi and other senior leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood, who have been charged with inciting murder and violence. The detainees who died on 18 August were among 45 being transported to Abu Zabal prison in a vehicle designed to carry only 24 people, the Reuters news agency quoted a prosecution statement as saying. The state-run al-Ahram newspaper said on its website that the state prosecutor had ordered the four policemen charged with their manslaughter to be remanded in custody. </body>

      <title>US added 148,000 jobs in September</title>
      <description>The US economy added a lower-than-expected 148,000 jobs in September, official figures show, but the unemployment rate fell to 7.2%.</description>

      <body>The US economy added 148,000 jobs in September, official figures show, lower than analysts had predicted. The unemployment rate fell to 7.2%, down from 7.3% in August, the US Department of Labor said. The release of the figures was delayed by the partial shutdown of the US government earlier this month. Economists had predicted 180,000 job gains for September, and the lower-than-expected figure could raise fears the US economy is losing momentum. Employment in professional and business services grew at the fastest pace with 32,000 new jobs added. Leisure and hospitality was the only sector to see a fall with 13,000 jobs lost. Carl Leahey, senior adviser at Decision Economics, said the report was "so-so", and meant the US central bank was likely to continue its massive $85bn-a-month economic stimulus programme. "This report will soften people's assessments of current conditions. With the possibility of a replay of the budget showdown as early as mid-January, why would the Fed want to pull any levers now?," he said. Following the figures, stock markets turned higher, with the FTSE 100 up 0.5% at 6,688 and both the Dow futures and broader SandP index futures up 0.3%, as investors bet on the Fed continuing its stimulus programme at the same pace. The dollar fell, under pressure from the expectation that the stimulus programme, which effectively creates more dollars, will continue at the same rate. The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, maintained its economic stimulus programme last month, suggesting it was still uncertain about the strength of the economic recovery. "Today's underperforming jobs number fully justifies September's cautious FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee)," said Joseph Trevisani, chief market strategist at WorldwideMarkets. The Labor Department said the next US unemployment data would be released on 8 November, a week later than scheduled due to the partial shutdown of the US government. Its workers were placed on unpaid leave during the shutdown raising fears the department will struggle to collect accurate data for October. "The October survey will be compromised by the late survey and the unquantifiable indirect private sector job losses triggered by the shutdown, and the November numbers will be compromised by the recovery - we hope - of those same jobs," said Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics. </body>

      <body>Authorities in Nevada are weighing prosecuting the parents of a 12-year-old who shot a teacher dead and wounded two classmates before killing himself. Officials in the city of Sparks have not identified the boy but believe the weapon came from his home. He opened fire at Sparks Middle School on Monday, killing maths teacher and Afghanistan veteran Michael Landsberry. Police say Landsberry, 45, was shot as he tried to coax the boy to drop the gun. "I cannot express enough appreciation for Mr Landsberry," Washoe County Schools Superintendent Pedro Martinez said on Tuesday. "He truly is a hero." The two wounded children are expected to recover. Officials are still working to determine how the boy, who was enrolled at the school, gained access to a semi-automatic handgun. Police say the boy's parents are co-operating with investigators. "We have been in contact with the parents of the suspect in this matter and out of respect for them, we will not be releasing the identity of the shooter," Sparks Deputy Police Chief Tom Miller said at a news conference. "They are grieving parents and are going through a very challenging, difficult time." When asked if the parents would face charges, Mr Miller said, "That is basically a question for the local prosecutor. But the potential is there." The incident occurred at 07:15 local time on Monday (14:15 GMT) shortly before the scheduled start of classes. As many as 200 police officers responded to the scene, authorities said. </body>

      <body>Thousands of clandestine migrants have reached Europe in recent months, with increasing numbers arriving from war-torn Syria. The BBC's Matthew Price has been following the progress of one Syrian family who sought asylum in Austria after arriving on the island of Lampedusa in Italy. The little dark-haired boy is sitting bolt upright on a bench in a cafe just across the road from Vienna's Meidling railway station. His puffer jacket is zipped right up to his neck. He is fast asleep. His younger sister is also trying to sleep, face down with her head on her arms on a table by the window. Their mother lights another cigarette, and draws on it nervously. Theirs has been the longest journey - and it is not over yet. Their train pulled in from Bologna, Italy, a few hours ago. The family huddled together in a carriage, as they had been all night - not knowing what to expect when they arrived, not knowing whether they would arrive. In Italy, "they gave us a choice - to stay or leave," says the mother, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals for her relatives left behind in their native Syria. We shall call her Amal. But "there is no way we could find work in Italy," she adds. The economic situation there is just too tough. Like many migrants, they wanted to head north, to central and northern Europe. Tears begin to wet her eyes. "I want a better life and stability for my children, I want them to go to school and live just like other kids. "My children ask me: 'Where is our house mum?' My daughter asks me about her bed, she wants to sleep in her bed, and I don't know what to say to her." The tears run down her cheeks. In the corner, her husband also starts to cry. Their journey together had started many years earlier. Amal married her husband, an architect, almost two decades ago. Their first child was born a few years later. Amal is a Muslim, her husband a Christian. From the start, they say they were persecuted because of their mixed marriage. So in 2000, they decided to move to Libya. They lived there for 11 years, until the revolution that overthrew Muammar Gaddafi started, and the country grew more and more unstable. So they returned to Syria, where they still owned two properties. "I was arrested when we landed at the airport," says Amal. It was - she says - a post on a social media site, quoting an Arabic poet that drew her to the authorities' attention. Amal received a three-year prison sentence as punishment for "endangering the country's security and humiliating the government", she says. Her husband sold their properties, and managed to bribe the judges on the case with $100,000 (£62,000). They reduced the sentence to eight months. As soon as she was released, the family was on the move again, helped by the rest of the money from the sale of their houses. They flew to Egypt, and there contacted smugglers who got them back into Libya. They hoped to stay, but after a few months they realised the country was too unstable, and they asked the smugglers to take them to Europe. "There were 200 people in the smugglers' house [in Libya]". "We stayed there for eight days." Then they boarded the boat for Europe. "It was like a death trip, a suicide trip." The children "were so scared and I regretted it. The boat was so bad. We were told the boat was big and that the trip would be comfortable. There was no way we could change our minds." They arrived in Lampedusa "thanks to God", says Amal. There they were housed in the island's small refugee centre, overflowing with new arrivals. Then, after a few days, when space became available at another centre in Foggia, southern Italy, they were transferred by plane by the Italian interior ministry. In Foggia, "we were told: 'You have three days to apply for asylum here or leave'." So they left, Amal said. "The Red Cross drove us to the train station. Someone from the refugee camp helped us book the tickets. We took the train to Bologna. Then another to Vienna." Under European Union law, migrants should be processed in the country in which they first arrive. That is where any asylum claim should be considered. According to Amal though, people in some parts of the Italian system allowed them to leave, and indeed actively encouraged them to go. The Austrian authorities are sending back many Syrians arriving through the Brenner Pass from Italy without the correct documents. It is similar to what so angered the French government back in 2011, when Tunisian and Libyan migrants were being granted temporary permits that allowed them to skip across the border using the train from Ventimiglia in north-west Italy to Nice in France. Italian officials say that without more help from the EU they cannot cope with the number of migrants reaching their shores at the moment. It is clear they are also trying to alleviate the pressure, by turning a blind eye to the rules that govern migration into the bloc. "It's a grey area," an EU official says. "It may not actually break the law, but it's not within the spirit of it." Before all this, Amal says, "our life was stable." "We had everything. My husband's job was very good. We lacked nothing. We could provide anything my children wanted." And now? "This is injustice. I don't blame the European countries," says Amal. "I blame the Arab countries who refuse to accept us." It is the Arab countries "who forced us to leave", she continues. If they took in Syrian refugees, families like hers would not have to "follow illegal ways to get here". The coffee and cigarettes finished, they head outside once again, with one suitcase between them, containing all that they own now. They take the tram out of the city, to the asylum centre. The little boy kicks up golden autumn leaves on the pavement. "It's very cold," says Amal. Her younger daughter pulls a towel tightly round her shoulders for warmth. "I want my children to smile again," Amal says. The wind whips up the leaves, scattering them. The sun is low in a hazy sky. That evening, Amal and her family formally request asylum in Austria. Since our correspondent last met them, and less than three weeks since arriving in Italy, Amal and her family were granted asylum in Austria. They are to be housed in a hotel until proper accommodation is found for them in Vienna. </body>

      <title>Grangemouth's economic significance</title>
      <description>The significance of the Grangemouth plant to the UK</description>

      <body>The Scottish government is looking to find a buyer for the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemicals plant. The current owner, Ineos, has said the plant will close without new investment and changes to workers' terms and conditions. Finding a buyer for the plant will be a challenge as there is an excess of refining capacity in Europe, meaning profit margins are low. So what would be the impact of the the closure of Grangemouth? Grangemouth refines 80% of the fuel used in Scotland and it also supplies Northern Ireland and the North of England. Contingency plans are being made to replace petrol and diesel supplies if the refinery closes and experts say that fuel could be sourced from elsewhere. "With petrol and diesel supplies, unless there is panic buying, there should not be a problem as there are plenty of imports," says Alexander Kemp, Professor of Petroleum Economics, at the University of Aberdeen. The number of refineries in the UK has been falling for decades and at the moment there are seven. Coryton in Essex was the most recent to close after its owner Petroplus, filed for bankruptcy in 2012. But analysts say there is still overcapacity in Western Europe and the situation has been made worse recently by cheap fuel imports from the United States. US refineries pay around $15 a barrel less than UK refineries for crude oil, which has helped US firms to export cheap fuel to the UK. But Professor Kemp says there is a longer term issue of energy security for the UK as "we can't always rely on cheap imports of fuel". At the moment the UK imports 47% of the diesel and 50% of the aviation fuel it needs. But for petrol there is currently a 20% oversupply, according to figures from the research group, IHS Purvin and Getz. Its research shows that if two refineries were to close down, the UK would rely on imports for more than 70% of its diesel and jet fuel and more than 20% of its petrol. The Grangemouth refinery has an annual turnover of billions of pounds a year and has 1,370 staff. It also employs another 2,000 contractors and the refinery's owner, Ineos, estimates that 10,000 jobs indirectly rely on the facility. Due to the refinery and the associated chemicals business, the Falkirk area employs more people in manufacturing than the rest of Scotland combined. "It's actually a fundamental part of the infrastructure of the chemical, petrochemical and plastics industries of the UK and it would be madness to have it shut down," said the local Labour MP, Michael Connarty. But Ineos says the refinery is losing £10m a month and needs an investment of £300m. The Forties pipeline delivers a third of the UK's oil output. The steam and power which runs the pipeline and BP's Kinneil terminal comes from Grangemouth. At the moment the supply of steam and power has not been interrupted and Ineos and union workers have been keen to maintain supplies. But if Grangemouth is forced to close then it is not clear what happens next. A strike at Grangemouth in 2008 shut the Kinneil terminal and that forced 70 North Sea oil platforms to shut down or reduce production. PetroChina owns half the refinery which is operated by Ineos. It can process 210,000 barrels of crude daily. Ineos also owns the petrochemical plant which is attached to the refinery. Analysts say the petrochemicals plant would struggle to run profitably without the refinery. </body>

      <title>Antique guns 'adapted' by criminals</title>
      <description>Obsolete guns being adapted by gangs facing weapons shortage</description>

      <body>Antiques and obsolete guns are being adapted and used by criminals facing a shortage of weapons, according to police. A decade ago, Britain's cities were experiencing a surge in gun crime but, following successful interventions by crime agencies and the government, the number of firearms offences annually is now half what it was in 2003, according to the Office for National Statistics. One reason is the supply of weapons has been severely restricted, forcing criminals to seek out other means of sourcing guns. The National Ballistics Intelligence Service (NABIS), established in 2008, helps police forces solve crimes in which guns have been used, identify individuals who import and supply them illegally, and track down people who are illegally converting or adapting them. On the firing range at its base in a Birmingham suburb, ballistics expert Greg Taylor shoots several rounds from a Russian-made Baikal pistol. Built to fire CS gas canisters, they were easily adapted to fire live 9mm ammunition. There was a period, a few years ago, where this was the go-to gun of choice for criminal gangs in the UK, but as a result of international co-operation between British and Russian authorities and those in the Baltic states, the supply has dried up. But other weapons have taken its place. In the laboratory next door cupboards are filled with evidence from active firearms investigations by the 28 police forces in England and Wales which NABIS serves. On the desks are microscopes used by the ballistics experts to match bullets to weapons and in the armoury is a collection of hundreds of different weapons, kept in store in order to be used to provide matches to crime scenes. Many were brought here rather than destroyed after successful prosecutions in the courts. One is the Hungarian Feg pistol which was used during an incident where West Midlands Police officers were attacked during the riots in 2011. They came under fire from gang members outside the Barton Arms pub in Aston. As a result, 10 people were jailed, including Beniha Laing and Wesley Gray, who were sentenced to 35 and 29 years respectively. Another weapon seized after that attack was a French-made Saint-Etienne army revolver, used by the French Army in the 1870s. Like many weapons of that era, spanning from the American Civil War until WWI, they can be legally imported as antiques. Though they were built to fire ammunition that is now obsolete, they can be adapted to fire modern bullets. "You can buy a weapon like that because it's of obsolete calibre, there's no licence required, and criminals are converting or modifying ammunition to fit," said Mr Taylor. As we are discussing the problem, a new addition to the collection is brought in - a single shot Derringer-style pistol, which might have been carried by ladies in the late 19th Century for personal protection. It is thought that a number of burglaries at antiques weapons collectors' homes across the country may have been ordered by gangs who are desperate to source new guns and rifles. There are stringent penalties for possessing a firearm, including imprisonment. However, NABIS say there are now "armourers", who illegally provide guns for hire to gangs because of the shortage of supply. In some cases, the same gun might have been used a number of times by different gangs in different cities. "In the UK, getting your hands on a weapon is probably not as free and easy as it is in some countries," said Det Supt Iain O'Brien. "So you have a situation where weapons can be used by different sides of a dispute." The next potential threat in this country is the introduction of a gun which can be made using a 3D printer. It would not need to be imported. When the ballistics expert tested one on the range, using a remote firing device and behind the safety of a bulletproof screen, it blew up. It would probably have caused more damage to the person firing it than the one being fired at. However, as crude as early versions are, they could become more sophisticated. </body>

      <description>Sir Alex Ferguson on Beckham, Keane and Ronaldo</description>

      <body>Sir Alex Ferguson's eagerly anticipated autobiography provides unprecedented insight into one of football's most successful and iconic managers. The 71-year-old retired last summer after 26 years as manager of Manchester United, having guided the club to 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, four League Cups and two Champions League crowns. In 'Alex Ferguson: My Autobiography', released on Thursday, the Scot, who was succeeded by David Moyes, addresses a number of subjects. Ferguson's falling-out with David Beckham followed United's FA Cup fifth-round defeat to Arsenal in 2003. The United boss was critical of the midfielder's performance - but Beckham did not react well to being singled out. "As usual, with David at that time, he was dismissive of my criticism," wrote Ferguson. "He was around 12 feet from me. David swore. I moved towards him, and as I approached I kicked a boot. It hit him right above the eye. He rose to have a go at me and the players stopped him. 'Sit down,' I said. 'You've let your team down. You can argue as much as you like.' "I called him in the next day to go through the video and he still would not accept his mistake. "The next day, the story was in the press. It was in those days that I told the board David had to go." Ferguson says Ronaldo was the "most gifted player" he managed, adding: "He surpassed all the other great ones I coached at United." The winger spent six years at Old Trafford before he moved to Real Madrid in 2009 for a world-record £80m transfer fee. He might have moved to Real a year earlier, but Ferguson had been unhappy with the Spanish club's public courting of the player, who had joined United from Sporting Lisbon in a £12m deal in 2003. The Scot was so irate with Real president Ramon Calderon that he told Ronaldo he would rather "shoot" him than "sell" him to Real at that stage, before promising the player he could leave Old Trafford the following summer if the right deal came along. Ferguson had several run-ins with Rafael Benitez while the Spaniard was manager of Liverpool. In his book, Ferguson explained that the chief reason for the fall-out was because Benitez chose to "turn our rivalry personal". Ferguson said: "Once you made it personal, you had no chance. Benitez was striving for trophies while also taking me on. That was unwise." Ferguson is a big admirer of Rooney's natural ability but had concerns about his fitness, particularly during his last season in charge. "I felt he was struggling to get by people and had lost some of his old thrust," wrote Ferguson, who signed Rooney from Everton in 2004. "As time wore on, I felt he struggled more and more to do it for 90 minutes." Finally, Ferguson added that Rooney came to see him after United had won the Premier League title last season and asked to leave the club. Ferguson explained: "I left him to discuss his future with David Moyes, hoping to see many more great performances from him at Old Trafford." Perhaps the biggest criticism in Ferguson's book is reserved for former United midfielder Roy Keane. Ferguson wrote the following: "The hardest part of Roy's body is his tongue. He has the most savage tongue you can imagine. "He can debilitate the most confident person in the world in seconds. He was an intimidating, ferocious individual." </body>

      <title>The cult of the French pastry chef</title>
      <description>The new breed of French pastry chefs</description>

      <body>No French high street would be complete without a patisserie, and words such as "gateau", "eclair" and "flan" indicate that French pastry chefs are esteemed as much abroad as at home. But in the last couple of years, patissiers have shot to stardom, joining the top ranks of France's celebrity chefs. French patisserie used to be delicious but predictable - the chocolate eclair, the vanilla or raspberry flavoured macaroon, the classic French apple tart or the mille-feuille (a sophisticated vanilla slice). Something has changed. Ever heard of the caramel popcorn, pistachio-orange or pecan eclair by Christophe Adam? Or the olive-oil macaroon with mandarin orange and cucumber water by Pierre Herme? These are a couple of the audacious creations a new generation of French pastry chefs have launched on a startled but delighted French public. France has always loved patisserie, but for some reason it now loves its patissiers more than ever. Their books are filling the shelves of book shops, and their stores are multiplying - five new "patisseries de luxe" opened in the month of September, in Paris alone. And while The Great British Bake Off has gone from strength to strength, France has developed its own competitive baking shows, such as this year's Who Will be the Next Great Patissier? For the last episode contestants had to make a piece of fashion out of chocolate. Another show, The Gateau of My Dreams, where a chef goes to someone's house to help them bake a challenging cake or dessert, began in February 2012 - starting with mille-feuille with caramelised maple syrup, and Black Forest gateau with acidulated morello cherry - and published a spin-off book in its first year. One explanation for the sudden rise of the pastry chef is as a consequence of the recession. In these times of crisis, patisserie has become a relatively affordable luxury - compared say with going to the restaurant - says Sebastien Gaudard, one of today's up-and-coming pastry chefs. He has noticed a change in his customers' habits. Instead of buying a big cake for a Sunday lunch or a dinner party, couples are now more likely to visit during the week to buy one or two patisseries for themselves alone. Patisserie, he says, is a form of comfort food. "What drives the world of sweets, I think, is that eating sweets brings us back to a time in our lives when we had no worries, the carefree time of childhood." But the growing enthusiasm for patisserie is also due to the fact that a new generation of pastry chefs have re-invented their craft, according to Zakari Benkhadra, managing director of the Ecole Nationale Superieure de la Patisserie (ENSP), in the countryside south of Lyon. Chefs have started to make elaborate and visually interesting creations using techniques such as mixing sweetness and saltiness (salty macaroons), creating original shapes (an audio cassette shaped pistachio-chocolate bar) or making surprising high-quality desserts using mainstream products such as Haribo sweets and Nutella. A parallel piece of culinary invention, which made headlines earlier this year, was the cronut - a cross between a croissant and a donut - created by French chef Dominique Ansel in New York. The patisserie craze has had a direct impact on the ENSP's enrolment numbers. Struggling to fill some classes in 2008, it now turns away some applicants for lack of space. But not all the top patissiers are modernising traditional recipes and improvising with new tastes. Sebastien Gaudard represents another trend, which is to return to authentic and relatively simple creations. "My wish is to render the past marvellously present," says Gaudard, 43. Gaudard, the son of a famous pastry chef in Lorraine, eastern France, is one of a number of contemporary pastry chefs who served an apprenticeship at the Paris institution, Fauchon, which is famed above all for its patisserie. Since November 2011 he has run a shop in the ninth arrondissement of Paris, selling delicacies from the past that are no longer always available in every patisserie. These include the Puits d'amour, a dessert created by the 18th Century chef Vincent La Chapelle, its hollow centre stuffed with vanilla cream, and the classic Paris-Brest, made of choux pastry and a praline-flavoured cream, inspired by the Paris-Brest-Paris cycle race - its circular shape representing a bicycle wheel. A speciality is the Mussipontain a cake made of meringue, vanilla cream and caramelised almonds whose name derives from the inhabitants of the city of Pont-à-Mousson, Gaudard's home town. This is his father's own creation. But whether people prefer startling creativity or traditional pastries, all pastry chefs are out to please their customers - and the customers evidently enjoy being pleased. "We sell pleasure," says Gaudard. "People come to us for pleasure." </body>

      <description>Are people too snobbish about frozen food?</description>

      <body>A new series captures what life is like at frozen food retailer Iceland, but are some of us a little bit snooty in our attitude to frozen food? Google it and you'll see there have been dozens of attempts to establish whether fresh or frozen vegetables are better for you. Many cite a US Food and Drug Administration report from 1998 that established frozen was better than fresh. Advocates of frozen say the process prevents nutrient loss occurring in transport. Even those who plump for fresh admit that frozen vegetables are still a healthy option. And yet there's a marked degree of antipathy towards frozen food. "Iceland is a classic British institution that half the country loves and half the country hates. Half of the population absolutely hate it without ever having, in most cases, been in a shop or bought a product," says Keith Hann, PR consultant for Iceland Foods. "In a word, snobbery." For some, frozen food conjures up images of Mike Leigh's 1977 drama Abigail's Party, with kitsch dishes such as defrosted prawn cocktail, vol-au-vents and black forest gateau, not forgetting the staple of any 70s dinner party - the Arctic roll. Brian Young, director general of the British Frozen Food Federation (BFFF), says he senses a chill in the air when it comes to the British public's opinion of frozen food. "Pretty much every food manufacturer will do blind testing of their product and every blind test that I've known, particularly on fish and other products, will ask the consumer to compare two samples side by side and nearly always they prefer the frozen variety. "If you then show them the packaging and you show it was a frozen product or a fresh product, they then nearly always choose the fresh one, even though they have just tasted something that was significantly better." Price could be a factor, suggests Young. "[Frozen food] can be produced much more efficiently than a fresh or a chilled counterpart, so it finishes up that the price of the product is quite often significantly less. People associate the fact that if you looked at two pizzas and one was £2.50 and one was £1.50 you naturally assume the £2.50 one is better quality." Cutting down on waste in the supply chain is one of the biggest advantages of freezing, says Young. But he also claims there are health benefits. Research conducted recently by Chester University and Leatherhead Food Research - and funded by the BFFF - found in two out of three cases frozen fruit and vegetables contained more antioxidants and nutrients than fresh produce. "They are losing their vitamins, they are losing their antioxidants the minute they come out of the ground or you pick them off the plant or tree, so by freezing them you lock in that goodness for longer," says Young. However Michael Barker, editor of Fresh Produce Journal, says consumers do like the taste and that "just picked" look of fresh produce. "It's true scientifically that you do start to lose [some] nutrients as soon as the product is picked, but I don't think it's such a massive loss that you're not still getting those nutrients. It's still an incredibly healthy product to eat regardless of whether it's fresh or frozen," says Barker. He says fresh and frozen are not rivals when it comes to the food chain. "The number of fruit and vegetables, and particularly fruit, that you find frozen is relatively limited. You think about the biggest selling fruits - bananas, oranges, apples, pears - you don't really see these in frozen formats." Jamie Oliver and Delia Smith have both used frozen vegetables in recipes on their cookery programmes. But David Gray, analyst at Planet Retail, rejects the idea that frozen food has any type of image problem. "Frozen food is a lot more popular than it used to be, a lot more common," says Gray. "It is seen as good value for money by consumers." He believes the industry's reputation was knocked recently by the horse meat scandal which affected frozen meat products, but predicts frozen food sales will keep rising. He also says frozen food could expand into discount stores. Some pound stores are already starting to sell a small selection of frozen food. There has even been a resurgence in the popularity of some retro classics such as chicken Kiev - eaten by Don Draper in the 1960s inspired TV series Mad Men. As well as expanding into new areas of the high street, frozen food manufacturers and retailers are also now offering consumers new ranges at the top end of the market. For example, frozen food store Cook sells handmade food for the freezer. Beef wellingtons are priced at £20 for two portions, and on the packet you will find the name of the chef who prepared the dish before it was frozen. Food critic and regular on BBC's Masterchef Kate Spicer says there is a "revolution in home cooked food being sold on to people". She advocates schemes such as buying homemade food from a neighbour who has more time to spare to prepare meals which can then be frozen. When it comes down to it the British public are not snobbish about the method of preservation, she says. "There's frozen food and there's frozen food, and I think a lot of it has to do with the brand on the box and not the fact that it's frozen," says Spicer.

      <body>To fans of motor racing the banked section of crumbling road in the above picture is instantly recognisable as the home of British motorsport, Brooklands. This was the site of the first purpose-built motor racing circuit anywhere in the world, and one that in its heyday in the 1920s and '30s saw thousands of fans lining the track, hoping to catch a glimpse of those pioneering racers. The course was built in 1907 with sections of concrete banking to allow the cars to reach higher speeds than would otherwise have been possible. The design ensured it was the site of a number of land speed records and was home to the first British Grand Prix in 1927. Alongside its motoring heritage it was also home to aviation pioneers, and by the start of World War II the site was given over to use by Vickers-Armstrongs and Hawker aircraft companies. Sadly, motor racing never returned to the site, though TV presenter James May did attempt to build the biggest Scalextric track along the route. Photographer Douglas Kurn lives locally and decided to undertake the task of documenting the remains of the Brooklands circuit. To contrast with the noise and speed of a race day, Douglas chose to shoot the project at night to give a peaceful, surreal feel to the images. Some of the exposures ran well past the hour and in total the project has taken four years to complete. The Spirit of Brooklands was chosen by the Association of Photographers for its online exhibition of members' work, and a selection of prints was recently exhibited at the Brooklands Museum in Weybridge.

      <title>Britain's Syria dilemma - UK talks</title>
      <description>When is regime change not regime change?</description>

      <body>When is regime change not regime change? That in a sense is the dilemma of British and much of Western policy towards Syria. There is no doubt that Britain - like many other governments - would like to see the back of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. But Britain's policy is not "regime change" if by that is meant the forcible removal of President Assad from power by outside military intervention. The approach taken to oust the Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi is not seen as either practical or appropriate for Syria. The British Foreign Secretary William Hague has always insisted that the agency of change in Syria must be the Syrian people themselves. Britain is certainly backing key elements of the opposition forces - those represented here in London at a meeting with Arab and Western foreign ministers - under the umbrella body the Syrian National Coalition. But Britain's stated goal is a political transition in the country, agreed at the negotiating table, whereby President Assad effectively gives up power. Mr Hague reiterated the primacy of the political track in his comments ahead of the London meeting between the Syrian National Coalition and their key backers among Western and Arab governments. "We want the moderate opposition in Syria to know that we are behind them in going to Geneva," said Mr Hague, "and that we will continue to help them in many ways and to persuade them that this is the only way to solve this tragic and bloody conflict in Syria. There has to be a political process." Of course there have been moments when Britain has been ready to take a very different tack. The British government was willing to participate in military action to punish the Syrian regime for its alleged use of chemical weapons. But the British Parliament was not ready to sanction military force and neither was the US Congress - when push came to shove, military action was removed from the agenda. Of course, the real question is whether the British approach to Syria is likely to succeed in leading to a political transition, and more significantly, what kind of Syria would such a transition produce? The fact is that options are limited. There are only a few levers through which influence can be exerted, and in the final analysis the situation on the ground inside Syria is for now probably just too complex to be amenable to outside diplomatic solutions. Britain, like many other Western governments, threw its weight behind the moderate opposition in Syria in response to the repression of President Assad's government. Before that, President Assad had been something of a favourite of the West, courted especially by London and Paris. Policy in the early stages of the Syrian conflict was heavily influenced by the then limited experience of the "Arab Spring", which was still seen as a broadly positive movement under which tyrannical regimes were overthrown by popular pressure from below. Syria was seen as just the latest such regime to come under threat. Hindsight is wonderful thing. Quite what alternative policy options were open is unclear. But the initial rosy glow of Arab empowerment has given way to a more nuanced and in many cases conflicted analysis. The Arab Spring has overthrown governments offering a measure of stability and unleashed forces that in some cases are antithetical to the democratic values many believed the Arab Spring enshrined. The dilemmas have been seen most profoundly in Egypt where a successor and elected Islamist government was itself overthrown by what many would regard as a military coup. The problems in Syria have manifested themselves even before the collapse of the government. Jihadist groups hold sway in some areas of the country. More moderate Islamists with a largely Syrian agenda are increasingly prominent among the armed groups combating the government on the ground. Many of these groups too are not eager to sit down with President Assad's people in Geneva. Britain is seeking to deal with what it calls "the moderate" opposition. It's an opposition made very much in its own image. Would be democrats, exiles, technocrats, the sort of people Britain and other Western governments believe could create a new open and democratic Syria. But how representative are these groups of the factions on the ground? How well are they linked into the fragmented and volatile world of the opposition? And crucially could they hold power against other centrifugal forces if the political process ever does arrive at the transition that Western governments and many Syrians crave? </body>

      <title>Leadership - Fergie's recipe</title>
      <description>What Sir Alex Ferguson can teach us about leadership</description>

      <body>Loyalty, control, discipline. Those are the ingredients of leadership. So says the man who I once teasingly described as "the greatest living Briton". Sir Alex Ferguson was launching his new autobiography today. I went along to Fergie's news conference to ask the man known simply as "the boss" whether the qualities that make a great leader on and off the pitch can be transferred to other fields and, in particular, to politics. What leaders have to do, he told me, was to create loyalty in their staff, transmit their philosophy and exert control and discipline. Leadership, he says, is a quality which allows your personality to transfer to everyone. Interestingly his book, though largely about football, does include a revelation about his involvement in politics. He denies a claim made in Tony Blair's memoirs that he had advised the former prime minister to sack Gordon Brown. Ferguson's recollection is that while Blair asked him how to handle superstars and not Brown in particular. The advice was clear and is a theme of this book - "the minute they threaten your control, you have to get rid of them". Fergie describes himself as being "on the left" of the Labour party, "closer to Brown (than Blair) in principle" but accepting that "Blair's more populist way was the route to get elected". Today the questions all focussed on the big footballing names Sir Alex struggled to control or to compete with - Beckham, Keane, Mourinho and the rest. There are many more I would love to ask about how a leader inspires loyalty, maintains control and instils discipline. My colleague David Bond's interview with Sir Alex will run soon. </body>

      <title>US agency 'hacked French diplomats'</title>
      <description>New revelations in Le Monde newspaper allege the US National Security Agency spied on French diplomats in Washington and at the UN.</description>

      <body>The US National Security Agency has spied on French diplomats in Washington and at the UN, according to the latest claims in Le Monde newspaper. NSA internal memos obtained by Le Monde detailed the use of a sophisticated surveillance programme, known as Genie. US spies allegedly hacked foreign networks, introducing the spyware into the software, routers and firewalls of millions of machines. It comes a day after claims the NSA tapped millions of phones in France. The details in the latest Le Monde article are based on leaks from ex-intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, through Glen Greenwald, the outgoing Guardian journalist, who is feeding the material from Brazil, says the BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris. It comes on the day the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, is in London meeting foreign counterparts to discuss Syria. The Le Monde report sets out details of Genie, an NSA surveillance programme in which spyware implants were introduced remotely to overseas computers, including foreign embassies. It claims bugs were introduced to the French Embassy in Washington (under a code name "Wabash") and to the computers of the French delegation at the UN, codenamed "Blackfoot". The article suggests that in 2011, the US allocated $652m (£402m) in funding for the programme, which was spent on "spy implants". Tens of millions of computers were reported to have been hacked that year. A document dated August 2010 suggests intelligence stolen from foreign embassy computers ensured the US knew ahead of time the positions of other Security Council members, before a UN vote for a resolution imposing new sanctions on Iran. The US was worried the French were drifting to the Brazilian side - who were opposed to implementing sanctions - when in truth they were always aligned to the US position, says our correspondent. The intelligence agency quotes Susan Rice, then-US ambassador to the UN, who praises the work done by the NSA: "It helped me know... the truth, and reveal other [countries'] positions on sanctions, allowing us to keep one step ahead in the negotiations." On Monday, Le Monde alleged that the NSA spied on 70.3 million phone calls in France between 10 December 2012 and 8 January 2013. At a breakfast meeting with the US secretary of state on Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius demanded a full explanation. Referring to a telephone call between the French and US presidents, Mr Fabius told reporters: "I said again to John Kerry what Francois Hollande told Barack Obama, that this kind of spying conducted on a large scale by the Americans on its allies is something that is unacceptable." Asked if France was considering reprisals against the US, government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem replied: "It is up to Foreign Minister Fabius to decide what line we take but I don't think there is any need for an escalation. "We have to have a respectful relationship between partners, between allies. Our confidence in that has been hit but it is after all a very close, individual relationship that we have." Both French officials made their comments before the latest revelations appeared in Le Monde. Mr Snowden, a former NSA worker, went public with revelations about US spying operations in June. The information he leaked led to claims of systematic spying by the NSA and CIA on a global scale. Targets included rivals like China and Russia, as well as allies like the EU and Brazil. The NSA was also forced to admit it had captured email and phone data from millions of Americans. Mr Snowden is currently in Russia, where he was granted a year-long visa after making an asylum application. The US wants him extradited to face trial on criminal charges. </body>

      <title>Syria opposition urged to join talks</title>
      <description>Syria's moderate opposition should "commit itself fully" to planned peace talks, ministers from the Friends of Syria group of countries say.</description>

      <body>Syria's moderate opposition should "commit itself fully" to planned peace talks, the Friends of Syria group of countries has said. The talks in Geneva next month offered Syrians the "best hope to improve their lives", UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said. Ministers have gathered in London to meet Syrian opposition officials. A key group in Syria's main opposition alliance has threatened to boycott the planned meeting, dubbed Geneva II. Mr Hague's US counterpart John Kerry said he believed and hoped the meeting would go ahead as planned but that Western countries could not control whether all parties would attend. Addressing the opposition, Mr Kerry said: "You can win at the negotiating table what it may take a long time and a lot of... loss of life to win on the battlefield." Ahmad Jarba, head of the main opposition grouping, the Syrian National Coalition (SNC), said the coalition would decide at a meeting next week whether to participate. The SNC has previously been unwilling to talk to representatives of Mr Assad's government. Mr Hague said the process envisaged by the Friends of Syria involved the establishment "by mutual consent" of "a transitional governing body with full executive powers". Participants at the first round of talks in June 2012 (Geneva I) had sought to end the civil war by getting Damascus and the opposition to choose a transitional government. Mr Hague reaffirmed the view of the Friends of Syria group - Britain, Egypt, France, Germany, Jordan, Italy, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United States - that Geneva II must be about a political transition in Syria away from the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Any transitional government could only be agreed with the consent of the SNC, and therefore Mr Assad would play no role in it, Mr Hague added. Mr Kerry said he expected representatives of the government to attend any talks and to "negotiate in good faith". Mr Hague and Mr Kerry also pledged further backing for Syria's moderate opposition, aimed at bolstering them in the face of rising influence extremists from power in the war-gripped country. Mr Jarba also spoke to reporters after meeting, outlining the steps that he considered necessary for the success of the Geneva talks. He called for safe corridors to be established to deliver humanitarian aid to opposition-held areas currently besieged by government forces. Mr Jarba also called for women and children he said were in regime custody to be released. He also expressed opposition to the idea of Iran having an active role in the process, accusing Iran of having tens of thousands of militiamen active in Syria. Iran as yet has no role in Geneva II, but Mr Hague earlier told the BBC he was trying to use new positive diplomatic relations with Iran to encourage it to play a "more constructive role". Also on Tuesday, the UN Special Co-ordinator for the mission to destroy Syria's chemical weapons, Sigrid Kaag, said in a statement that to date, the Syrian government had "fully co-operated" in the mission's work. Western officials have been buoyed by the initial results of the chemical disarmament effort, the BBC's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says. But he adds that they are painfully aware that the recent chemical deal has done nothing to alter the course of the civil war or to reduce the burgeoning humanitarian catastrophe in and around Syria. On Monday, Mr Assad told Lebanon's al-Mayadeen television that he saw no reason why he could not run for the presidency again. "Personally, I don't see any obstacles to being nominated to run in the next presidential elections," he was quoted as saying by the channel. Mr Assad told the channel that his government would take part in the conference without preconditions, but suggested the prospects that it would reach a settlement were, at present, dim. "No time has been set, and the factors are not yet in place if we want to succeed," he told al-Mayadeen. "Which forces are taking part? What relation do these forces have with the Syrian people? Do these forces represent the Syrian people, or do they represent the states that invented them?" he asked. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are key funders of opposition forces in Syria, including, it is believed, hardline Islamist groups. More than 100,000 people have been killed since the Syrian conflict began in 2011. The UN estimates that by the end of 2014 more than eight million Syrians could have been forced from their homes, including 5.2 million who will have fled the country. </body>

      <description>At least six Florida prisoners have attempted to escape using forged release papers, officials say, including two who were successful.</description>

      <body>At least six Florida prisoners have tried to escape using forged release documents, officials say, including two murderers who were successful. Joseph Jenkins and Charles Walker were freed on 27 September and 8 October respectively with bogus papers reducing their life sentences to 15 years. They were captured on Saturday at a motel in Panama City, Florida. Police are investigating if they had help. The mistake has led Florida to change its policy for early prisoner releases. Police said they were looking at several suspects who may have aided Jenkins and Walker, but have made no arrests. Florida law enforcement commissioner Gerald Bailey said the recaptured prisoners were not helping the investigation. "They've lawyered up," Mr Bailey said. "Should they choose to co-operate, we will have the answers we need. The answers we demand sooner than later." Police said someone was coming to the motel to take Jenkins and Walker to Atlanta in the neighbouring state of Georgia. Investigators were also reviewing a tablet computer and mobile phone found at the motel for evidence. Mr Bailey said there was no indication so far that anyone in the corrections department helped the two convicted killers with their escape, but investigators were still looking at any possibilities. Jenkins was released from a prison in the north of the state on 27 September after a clerk's office processed paperwork with a judge's forged signature. Walker was let out of the same prison on 8 October. Both men registered as felons with a local jail several days after their release - a requirement for former prisoners re-entering society. Mr Bailey said Jenkins had tried to escape using bogus documents before. Chief Circuit Judge Belvin Perry, whose signature was faked to released the men, signed an order on Monday that prohibits judicial orders from being accepted at drop-off boxes, and requires assistants to keep of a record of all orders that would change a prison sentence. </body>

      <title>Cuba to scrap two-currency system</title>

      <body>Cuba is to scrap its two-currency system in the latest financial reform rolled out by President Raul Castro, official media report. Since 1994 Cuba has had two currencies, one pegged to the US dollar and the other worth only a fraction of that. The more valuable convertible peso (CUC) was reserved for use in the tourism sector and foreign trade. Now its value will be gradually unified with the lower-value CUP, ending a system resented by ordinary Cubans. The Cuban economy is almost entirely state-run and the tourism sector has boomed since the collapse of the Soviet Union plunged Cuba into economic isolation and hardship. The two-currency system was supposed to protect Cuba's fragile economy but angered locals paid in the much lower-value CUP and denied access to goods only available for those with convertible pesos. The policy exacerbated the creation of a two-tier class system in Cuba which divided privileged Cubans with access to the lucrative tourist and foreign-trade sectors from those working in the local economy - all-too-visibly contradicting Cuba's supposedly egalitarian society. The council of ministers has approved a timetable for implementing "measures that will lead to monetary and exchange unification", the official Communist Party newspaper Granma said. Unification is "imperative to guarantee the re-establishment of the Cuban peso's value and its role as money, that is as a unit of accounting, means of payment and savings", it said. It gave no details of how quickly the change would be implemented, though Reuters news agency quoted Cuban economists as saying it would take about 18 months. </body>

      <title>Eta convict freed after court ruling</title>
      <description>Spain's high court sets a convicted Basque militant free, after a European court rules that prison work should have contributed to her early release.</description>

      <body>A convicted Basque militant has been freed after the Spanish authorities upheld a European Court of Human Rights ruling against her continued detention. Ines Del Rio, of the separatist group Eta, had been serving a 30-year sentence for bomb attacks in the 1980s. Spain's High Court had earlier backed the Strasbourg court's ruling against Spanish laws that denied her right to earn remission through prison work. Spain says dozens of Eta prisoners could now be eligible for release. Ines del Rio left the Teixeiro prison in A Coruna in north-west Spain at 16:25 local time (14:25 GMT). Monday's ruling by the European Court of Human Rights "gives us no choice", concluded a prosecutors' report at the High Court requesting Del Rio's immediate release, reported El Pais newspaper. The penal chamber subsequently ordered her immediate release. Groups representing victims of Eta's bloody four-decade campaign for independence for regions of northern Spain and south-west France denounced the Strasbourg ruling in protests on Monday, while supporters of the prisoners held marches in favour. Eta declared an end to its armed campaign in 2011. Del Rio was arrested in 1987 for her part in 23 murders and car bombings carried out by Eta. She was later sentenced to more than 3,800 years in jail, but the criminal code in force at the time reduced this to a maximum stay of 30 years. Del Rio earned sentence reductions through prison work, making her eligible for release in July 2008 - but two years earlier the High Court applied what is known as the "Parot doctrine" to extend her detention. Under this doctrine, sentence reductions are applied to the sentences for individual crimes - collectively amounting to 3,828 years - rather than the overall 30-year maximum stay. It meant Del Rio's release would be postponed until 2017. But on Monday the European Court of Human Rights, upholding a July 2012 ruling in favour of Del Rio, condemned Spain for this practice and ordered Spain to ensure her immediate release and to pay her 30,000 euros (£25,400; $41,000) in compensation. Although the Strasbourg court's ruling only applies to Del Rio, the Spanish government says dozens of other convicted Eta members could be eligible for release. </body>

      <body>The US has defended its drone strikes in Yemen and Pakistan, saying it takes "extraordinary care" to ensure they comply with international law. The unmanned raids targeting terror suspects were a "course of action least likely to result in the loss of innocent life", the White House said. It follows allegations by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International of the unlawful killing of civilians. Pakistan's PM on Tuesday urged the US to end drone attacks in his country. Speaking at the start of a visit to the US, Nawaz Sharif said the attacks violated his country's sovereignty. He added that the raids were a "major irritant" in relations with Washington. Drone warfare has become common in the US pursuit of al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Few details are known about these covert operations, which are directed remotely from control rooms, often on other continents. Senior militant leaders have been killed but civilians have also died, causing outrage in Pakistan, where many assert that the strikes cause indiscriminate deaths and injuries. In a new report released on Tuesday, Amnesty said it reviewed nine of 45 recent drone strikes in North Waziristan and found a number of victims were unarmed. In a separate report looking at six US attacks in Yemen, Human Rights Watch says two of them killed civilians at random, violating international law. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Washington was "reviewing the reports carefully". "To the extent these reports claim that the US has acted contrary to international law, we would strongly disagree. "The administration has repeatedly emphasised the extraordinary care that we take to make sure counter-terrorism actions are in accordance with all applicable law," he said. In the report, Will I Be Next? US Drone Strikes in Pakistan, Amnesty called on the US to disclose information and the legal basis for strikes carried out in Pakistan. It said US President Barack Obama's pledge earlier this year to increase transparency around drone strikes had not been fulfilled. It called on the governments of Pakistan, Australia, Germany and the UK to investigate drone strikes or other abuses that may constitute human rights violations. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch said in its report that six US drone attacks in Yemen had killed 82 people, including at least 57 civilians. It added that two of the strikes killed innocent people indiscriminately. Last week, a UN investigation found that US drone strikes had killed at least 400 civilians in Pakistan, far more than the US has ever acknowledged. UN special rapporteur Ben Emmerson accused the US of challenging international legal norms by advocating the use of lethal force outside war zones. A controversial aspect of the US policy is that drone attacks are carried out not by the military but by the Central Intelligence Agency. US Defence Secretary Leon Panetta has argued in favour of the policy, saying that the US will continue to defend itself. President Obama has insisted the strategy was "kept on a very tight leash" and that without the drones, the US would have had to resort to "more intrusive military action". </body>

      <body>Two officials in China have been sacked after unauthorised "restoration" work left centuries-old Buddhist frescos ruined, state media report. The paintings were inside a 270-year-old temple in the north-eastern province of Liaoning, and dated back to the early period of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). They have been completely painted over with cartoon-like Taoist figures. The case, exposed by a blogger, has drawn widespread condemnation in China. An official in charge of temple affairs and the head of the cultural heritage monitoring team in the city of Chaoyang, where the temple is located, have been sacked over the affair, the Global Times reported. The Communist Party chief of the office responsible for the scenic area surrounding the temple has also been given a warning, the paper quoted city official Li Haifeng as saying. The scandal was exposed by a blogger nicknamed Wujiaofeng, who posted photos of the "restored" frescos online and compared them with pictures of the originals. The local government in Chaoyang immediately launched an investigation after photos of the new paintings appeared online, the Global Times reported. Permission for the work to go ahead was given by city-level cultural heritage officials after a request by the temple abbot. But it should have been sought from the cultural heritage office at provincial level to ensure national standards were followed. This had not happened, Mr Li said. The project was given to a local firm which was not qualified for carrying out repair works on cultural relics, the official said. With investigations still going on, more officials will be punished, the paper added. Experts who work for the provincial cultural heritage office in Liaoning have suggested the frescos could be restored to how they used to look, but they will never be as good as the originals. The "restoration" work has drawn condemnation from users of Weibo, China's version of Twitter. One user said "I feel some people's brains were kicked by a donkey." Another said: "Ignorance is horrible!" </body>

      <body>Kenya's army chief has denied his troops were involved in looting during last month's siege at a Nairobi mall. Gen Julius Karangi told a parliamentary committee they had only taken water from a store in the Westgate Mall "to quench their thirst". His remarks come after CCTV footage emerged of troops carrying shopping bags out of the Nakumatt store. At least 67 people died when suspected al-Shabab militants stormed the Nairobi shopping centre on 21 September. News agencies say the CCTV footage which was released over the weekend is taken inside the entrance to the Westgate mall's Nakumatt supermarket, which sells everything from food to televisions. In one section of footage, several soldiers are seen walking out of the supermarket, past a blood-spattered floor, carrying plastic carrier bags. In another clip, Kenyan soldiers can be seen next to a mobile phone outlet. Gen Karangi was speaking to the joint committees on National Security and Defence, which are meeting behind closed doors. He said soldiers had only "picked water from the Nakumatt store to quench their thirst" and that they had only done it "with authority from their commanders" Commenting on other items that were taken away, Gen Karangi reportedly said this was "sanitisation to ensure their safety." The Kenyan military says it has launched an investigation into the looting allegations, which correspondents say will have angered many Kenyans. At the weekend, Kenya's biggest-selling newspaper, The Nation, ran an article entitled "Shame of soldiers looting Westgate". The footage of the alleged looting emerged as the Kenyan authorities announced they had recovered the body of what they consider to be a fourth attacker. The Westgate attack sparked a four-day siege in which large parts of the shopping centre were destroyed. </body>

      <body>The trial of Bolshoi ballet dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko over an acid attack on the company's artistic director has opened and been adjourned. Sulphuric acid was thrown at Sergei Filin outside his Moscow flat in January, badly damaging his eyesight. Mr Dmitrichenko denies arranging the attack. If convicted, he could face 12 years in jail. Two other men are being tried with him over the attack. The attack revealed bitter infighting and rivalries inside the Bolshoi. The other two on trial are Yuri Zarutsky, who is accused of throwing the acid, and Andrei Lipatov, who allegedly drove the getaway car. The venue for the trial - a tiny courtroom in Moscow - was packed with journalists as the defendants were led into a caged dock. Before proceedings began, Mr Dmitrichenko, 29, repeated that he was innocent of the charges. "I do not admit that I am guilty," he told journalists. Shortly after the trial got under way, the judge adjourned proceedings for a week because a lawyer for Mr Zarutsky was not present. The BBC's Steve Rosenberg says it was one of the most chaotic court hearings he has attended in Russia. After initially admitting to masterminding the attack, Mr Dmitrichenko later said he had discussed an assault on Mr Filin but not the use of acid. Following a pre-trial hearing, Mr Dmitrichenko's lawyer alleged that the defendant had been beaten by masked police - a claim that the Russian interior ministry has denied. The day before the trial, lawyer Sergei Kadyrov said: "Dmitrichenko does not consider himself guilty of causing grave harm to Filin's health." "I hope the court will be able to distance itself from the public resonance of this case and deliver a well-grounded and just verdict." Mr Filin has had more than 20 operations to try to save his eyesight. Following treatment in Germany, he returned to Moscow for the inauguration of the Bolshoi's season last month, wearing dark glasses. At one point, more than 300 members of the Bolshoi Ballet wrote to President Vladimir Putin, saying that the idea that Mr Dmitrichenko was behind the crime was "absurd". Mr Dmitrichenko has been in custody since March. </body>

      <body>Police in the Republic of Ireland have removed a seven-year-old blonde girl from a Roma family in Dublin. The girl was taken into care after officers called to a house in Tallaght on Monday afternoon. They saw a number of children, including the seven-year-old girl who has blonde hair and blue eyes. The parents told police the child was their daughter, but officers were not satisfied with the explanation nor with the documents that were produced. The Sunday World newspaper reported that a birth certificate was believed to have eventually been produced but officers were not satisfied with it. The paper reported that although the couple claimed the child was born in the Coombe hospital in Dublin in 2006, the hospital had no record of the child being born on the date quoted by the parents. The child was removed from the family under powers in the Child Care Act. It is understood the child is now in the care of the Health Service Executive (HSE). An interim care order is being sought, under which the child can remain in care for up to 28 days while a police investigation continues. Police had been told by a member of the public that a six or seven-year-old girl was living with a large Roma family and looked nothing like any of her siblings. Last week a young blonde girl was found during a raid on a Roma camp in central Greece. A Roma couple have been formally charged with abducting the girl, named Maria, and have been placed in detention pending a trial. DNA tests showed that she was not related to the couple, who insist they were given her legitimately. Maria is being cared for by a charity in Athens, which has received more than 8,000 calls after an appeal. The case has brought a response from two families in the UK with long-missing children. Ben Needham from Sheffield disappeared aged 21 months while on a family holiday on the Greek island of Kos in 1991. His sister said the discovery of the blonde-haired girl in central Greece gave them "great hope". A spokesman for Kate and Gerry McCann, whose three-year-old daughter Madeleine went missing in Portugal in 2007, said the case also gave them hope that she would one day be found alive. </body>

      <title>Australia merges bushfire blazes</title>
      <description>Fire fighters in Australia deliberately join two large fires near the Blue Mountains as part of efforts to control bushfires across New South Wales.</description>

      <body>Firefighters in Australia have deliberately joined up two large fires as part of efforts to control bushfires across New South Wales. The fires near the Blue Mountains had been "tactically joined" to stop them merging with a third, officials say. Teams are engaged in extensive back-burning operations across the state ahead of worsening conditions expected on Wednesday. On Tuesday morning more than 60 blazes were still alight, with 13 uncontained. The region experienced light rain but firefighters say this will not be enough to quench the fires. New South Wales declared a state of emergency on Sunday amid some of the region's worst fires in years. On Monday fire officials feared that three blazes in the Blue Mountains area near Lithgow - at State Mine, Mount Victoria and Springwood - could link up, creating a massive fire. But NSW Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said that joining two of the fires had prevented them linking up with the third. "We are seeing positive results of these very deliberate, very targeted, very decisive strategies being deployed particularly in relation to back-burning operations... particularly in light of [Wednesday's] weather conditions," he said. Back-burning is controlled burning of key areas aimed at depriving a fire of fuel and prevent it travelling in a certain direction. The fire at State Mine has been downgraded to "watch and act" - from "emergency" - after some light rain at the fire zone. However, Mr Fitzsimmons added that "there's still a way to go" and that firefighters would be braced for higher temperatures and stronger winds expected on Wednesday. "We have got now probably 24 hours before we see the worst of the weather starting to develop and build across all these fire ground areas," he said. The conditions on Wednesday would be "about as bad as it gets". NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell told the BBC: "Tomorrow Wednesday in Sydney is expected to be the critical day when weather conditions return to what they were like last Thursday when these fires first started." "Whilst we've lost more than 200 properties [and] another 100 or so damaged, many thousands have been saved by the efforts of our volunteer and other fire fighters who've done a tremendous job for almost a week." Many families have their bags packed and are watching anxiously in case they are forced to flee, the BBC's Jon Donnison in the Blue Mountains reports. In parts of Sydney that has been shrouded in a smoky haze for much of the week air quality levels are reported to have been up to 50 times worse than normal, our correspondent adds. All schools in the Blue Mountains will be closed on Wednesday. One man has died - possibly of a heart attack - while trying to protect his home. Hundreds of people have been left homeless by the bushfires. On Monday, an 11-year-old boy in the Port Stephens area was charged with deliberately lighting two fires on 13 October. Another boy, 15, was also arrested over the fires, reports said. Amid debate over the causes of the fires in Australia, United Nations climate chief Christiana Figueres told US broadcaster CNN bushfires were "absolutely" linked to global warming, hitting out at Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's decision to repeal the carbon tax. "We are really already paying the price of carbon," she said. "We are paying the price with wildfires, we are paying the price with droughts." Mr Abbott has drafted legislation to repeal the carbon tax, introduced under the previous Labor government, which imposed a levy on the country's 300 biggest polluters. The new prime minister, who says the tax cost jobs and forced energy prices up, wants to introduce a Direct Action plan under which farmers and industry will be paid to act to reduce emissions.

      <description>The UN's human rights council criticises China during an official review of the country's human rights record.</description>

      <body>The UN human rights council has criticised China during an official review of its human rights record. Many members of the council expressed concern at the arrest of dissidents, the continued use of the death penalty and the use of torture in prison. But Chinese officials said major progress had been made in improving social and economic rights. They said people had better access to healthcare and education, and incomes had risen across the country. But Julie de Rivero, of Human Rights Watch, told the BBC that China's focus on economic progress was a way of avoiding the real issues. "The question is why does does China continue to torture people in prisons and why is it systematic? Why do they not allow human rights defenders to raise questions that party members are even raising, about corruption? When it comes from the mouth of a human rights defender it earns them a place in prison," she said. All UN member states undergo the review by the UN once every four years. In 2009 it was recommended that China make improvements in reducing poverty and support the rights of ethnic minorities. Human rights groups say China has failed to address these and other issues. Ahead of proceedings on Tuesday, at least three Tibet activists scaled scaffolding at the UN headquarters in Geneva, with a banner saying: "China human rights - UN stand up on Tibet". A Chinese government white paper released on Tuesday said that Beijing had no intention of altering its "correct" policies in Tibet as they had brought "unprecedented achievements". Members of the UN panel also expressed concern about the treatment of a number of Chinese human rights activists in recent weeks. A BBC correspondent says several have been arrested or banned from travelling in a bid to prevent them testifying in Geneva. On Monday, a wealthy Chinese businessman, Wang Gongquan, was formally arrested on suspicion of "gathering crowds to disturb public order". Mr Wang is considered a key supporter of a group of activists pushing for more official transparency, New Citizens Movement, which has been targeted in a crackdown this year. Human Rights Watch has also expressed concern about a well-known legal rights activist who recently disappeared after being questioned by Beijing airport police. The group says Cao Shunli has not been seen since 14 September, when she was barred from boarding a flight to Switzerland to attend a UN human rights training course. A number of bloggers and journalists have also been detained over alleged "rumour-mongering", and high-profile micro-bloggers targeted. The UN panel - with a rotating membership of 47 states that does not currently include China - has no binding powers. The UN is expected to deliver a report on China later this week. </body>

      <title>Facebook adds alerts to death clips</title>
      <description>Facebook adds warning signs to videos of beheadings and other instances of graphic violence, but its safety advisors still have concerns.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24628909</url>
      <date>1382453006</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70637000/jpg/_70637328_facebook.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Facebook has begun adding warning messages to videos on its site showing decapitations and other instances of extreme violence. The alert states: "Warning! This video contains extremely graphic content and may be upsetting." The move follows its decision to allow the clips to be posted to its site following a temporary ban on the material, introduced in May. The prime minister and Facebook's own advisors had criticised the decision. The social network said that it wished to allow its users - who can be as young as 13 - to share and condemn the material. It added that it would continue to block clips if the original poster glorified or celebrated the violence shown. On Monday the firm said it might, in time, add warnings or other controls, but initially allowed a recently uploaded decapitation clip to appear unaltered. This prompted David Cameron to tweet: "It's irresponsible of Facebook to post beheading videos, especially without a warning. They must explain their actions to worried parents." US charity the Family Online Safety Institute - a member of the social network's Safety Advisory Board - also raised concern saying it had not been alerted to the change of policy despite previously stating such videos "crossed the line". A spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment about its latest move. She had previously defended its decision to allow a video showing a woman being beheaded - believed to have been filmed in Mexico - to be shared despite the fact it bans images and videos showing a woman's "fully exposed breast". "Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences, particularly when they're connected to controversial events on the ground, such as human rights abuses, acts of terrorism and other violent events," she said. "People are sharing this video on Facebook to condemn it. If the video were being celebrated, or the actions in it encouraged, our approach would be different." A UK member of Facebook's Safety Advisory Board said he still had concerns despite the addition of the warnings. "It's a step forward but it's still horrific content," said Will Gardner, chief executive of Childnet. He added that he needed to look into the changes before commenting further. Until Monday Facebook had also featured adverts alongside the video of the Mexican murder despite the fact several users had complained to it about the material. Car-sharing firm Zipcar, whose service was one of those shown, said it was disappointed by the discovery. "We want you to know that we do not condone this type of abhorrent content being circulated on Facebook," it said in a statement. "We have expressed to Facebook in the past the critical need to block offensive content from appearing and we will continue to engage with them on this important matter." Facebook has since disabled Zipcar and other firms' ads from appearing on the page in question. One of the Facebook accounts that had requested the death video be removed belongs to the South Australia Police force (Sapol). It said it had been contacted by a member of its local community about the matter. Shelaye Boothey, director of Sapol's media and public engagement section, told the BBC: "Ultimately this is a decision that Facebook is entitled to make, however anyone concerned with the publishing of the video should continue to express their concerns through the appropriate Facebook channels." Hostage UK - a charity that supports kidnap victims and their families - added that it was also urging Facebook to reconsider its decision. "We know first-hand the acute distress these videos and images cause and we stress that this continues to be a source of worry to the families of today's hostages," it said. "We can see no useful purpose being served by the decision to make such recordings available. The public are well aware of the brutalities committed and a public showing of such material adds nothing, other than cause further unimaginable suffering." However, some freedom of speech campaigners believe that Facebook should not block the videos, even if they do celebrate the violence contained. French digital rights group La Quadrature Du Net described the actions as "privatised censorship". "It plays a profoundly anti-democratic role when it makes any such choice, whatever the limits are and whatever the good reasons it uses to make the decision," said the organisation's co-founder Jeremie Zimmermann. </body>

      <title>Jakarta street monkeys confiscated</title>
      <description>The first of some 350 performing street monkeys in the Indonesian capital Jakarta are confiscated to end "abuse", activists say.</description>

      <body>The first 11 out of an estimated 350 performing street monkeys in the Indonesian capital Jakarta have been confiscated and taken into quarantine, animal rights activists say. Jakarta Governor Joko Widodo said he was acting to save the monkeys and because they were a health risk. His move has been welcomed as "groundbreaking and significant" by the Jakarta Animal Aid Network. Spokeswoman Femke Den Haas told the BBC that it ends years of cruelty. The macaque monkeys are often dressed up and made to perform as street buskers, often attracting large audiences. The Jakarta authorities say that they will pay some cash compensation to the owners of the confiscated monkeys. Ms Den Haas said that Tuesday marked the first step in bringing an end to the inhumane treatment meted out to the monkeys. "We have been campaigning since 2009 against the use of street monkeys because they are subjected to a high level of cruelty," she said. "Frequently their teeth are cut out, they are often starved and made to hang upside down for prolonged periods. "They are all traumatised and require at least three months in quarantine before we can even contemplate re-releasing them into the wild - and even then it has to be in an area where there no other wild monkeys." Ms Den Haas said that a group of 40 street monkeys confiscated by the authorities in 2012 were found to be carrying various diseases including tuberculosis, hepatitis and the bacterial disease, leptospirosis. She said that the monkeys' handlers were invariably street children who were often exploited or coerced into becoming their handlers. "The monkeys live in pitiful conditions, are riddled with parasites and forced to live in small cages," she said. The Jakarta authorities initially intended that the monkey confiscations would begin in 2014 but they say that they were forced to act earlier because of the appalling conditions in which they are made to live. "That is related to order on the streets as well as rabies and other sorts of diseases, that is why we want to be free of performing monkeys and why we have started this week," Mr Widodo told local media on Monday. Posters promoting the campaign have been displayed across Jakarta as part of efforts to raise awareness of the issue. Mr Widodo said the city government would place the confiscated monkeys under the control of the Jakarta Marine and Agriculture Office while their owners were trained to learn new skills for other jobs. "We will think about them later, especially keeping in mind that most of the owners are not residents of Jakarta," he said. "The exploitation of monkeys for performances has become an international issue and the city administration will act immediately to save them." </body>

      <title>Brunei unveils tough Sharia code</title>
      <description>Brunei is to enforce a strict new Islamic legal code, expected to include death by stoning for adultery and flogging for consuming alcohol.</description>

      <body>The sultanate of Brunei has announced it will enforce a tough new Sharia law penal code. The code - to apply only to Muslims - is expected to introduce death by stoning for adulterers and the severing of limbs for theft. Brunei already adheres to a stronger form of Islamic law than neighbouring Malaysia and Indonesia, banning the sale and consumption of alcohol. The new code, to be enforced in six months, will strengthen that policy. Punishments could also include flogging for such crimes as consumption of alcohol or abortion, according to a copy of the code seen by news agency AFP. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, 67, who is one of the world's wealthiest men, introduced the code, calling it "a part of the great history of our nation". The sultan had already made religious education compulsory for Muslim children and ordered businesses to close during Friday prayers. But until now, Brunei's Sharia courts were limited to family matters like marriage and inheritance. Its civil courts are based on British law, a leftover from the sultanate's days as a British protectorate. Brunei's citizens have one of the highest standards of living in Asia, thanks to revenues from oil and gas, and enjoy free medical care and education. The sultan pledged the new code would not change his country's policies and officials have said in the past judges would be given discretion in sentencing. The code is to be applied only to Muslims, who make up about two-thirds of a population of 420,000. Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, told AFP the situation shows "respect for basic civil and political rights is near zero in Brunei". </body>

      <title>Apple shows off thinner iPad Air</title>
      <description>Apple shows off a new thinner top-of-the range iPad, which it says is lighter than any other full-sized tablet on the market.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24629711</url>
      <date>1382470481</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70645000/png/_70645910_air.png</thumbnail>
      <body>Apple has unveiled a top-of-the-range tablet called the iPad Air that is 20% thinner than the previous version. The 9.7in (24.6cm) computer is 7.5mm (0.3in) thick and weighs 1lb (469g), which the firm claims is the lightest full-sized tablet on the market. It is powered by the same A7 chip found in the company's iPhone 5S. The launch comes at a time when some analysts have suggested that Google's Android is about to overtake Apple's iOS as the bestselling tablet platform. Apple also announced a new version of its iPad Mini. Its 7.9in (20cm) screen has been upgraded to feature 2048 by 1536 pixels - the same as the larger model. It is being branded as "retina" to highlight the increased resolution. Amazon and Google have already announced small tablets - the Kindle Fire HDX and Nexus 7 - with similar high definition displays. "We've got the retina upgrade to the smaller iPad that many thought should have been there in the first place," Tony Cripps, principal analyst at tech consultants Ovum, reflected after the announcement in San Francisco. "Market share slip is inevitable because so many rival devices are coming out, which is not necessarily a bad thing as the overall sector is growing. "Apple does now have a cheaper model thanks to it offering the original iPad Mini at a lower price - but the firm doesn't really want to go to the low-end because that's not where the greatest profit is extracted." Apple also announced that the latest version of its Mac operating system, Mavericks, would be offered at no cost to owners of any compatible computer. It is the first time the company has not charged for a major Mac OS upgrade. By contrast the full version of Windows 8.1 is sold for about £100, although it is free to existing Windows 8 users. Linux-based Ubuntu has always been offered without charge. New laptops, productivity and leisure apps were also unveiled. However, Apple did not show off a new TV set-top box as some had speculated. The California-based firm's most recent financial release said that its iPad range accounted for $25.8bn (£17.6bn) worth of sales in the nine months leading up to July. That represented 19% of its revenue for the period. However, Apple acknowledged that the amount of money it was making from the product line was growing three times slower than the growth in unit sales since many customers were opting for its cheaper iPad Mini and iPad 2 models rather than its top-of-the -range "retina display" versions. It also faces the fact it is losing market share to rivals. Apple's iOS operating system accounted for 53.9% of all tablets shipped in 2012, according to Gartner. The tech research firm forecasts that Android will become the market leader with a 49.6% share, versus Apple's 48.6% this year, adding that it expects that gap to widen further in 2014. However, consultants at IHS iSuppli said those figures needed to be put in context thanks to Apple's success at making money by taking a cut of app sales. "It is in terms of revenue per active device where Apple's lead is strongest," said the firm's mobile media analyst Jack Kent. "An iOS device generates around three to four times as much app revenue through Apple's App Store as an Android device through Google Play. "Apple has so far offered a more compelling range of tablet-specific content, but Google is clearly looking to address this." He added that many Android tablets, including Amazon's Kindle and most products sold in China, did not have Google's store pre-installed. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook noted there were now 475,000 apps designed for iPads available through its online marketplace. But another market watcher suggested that Apple's priority remained securing a "premium" margin on the shop price of its hardware, and that add-on software sales were of secondary interest. "Some players, like Amazon, can afford to slash prices because they have a different business model based on content and commerce," said Thomas Husson, from the tech industry analysts Forrester. "While Apple has shared $13bn to developers since 2008, it has made less than $6bn out of apps. "It's a huge stat, but low in comparison with Apple's quarterly results." </body>

      <body>The Vatican has launched its own official cricket club as part of efforts to encourage interfaith dialogue. The St Peter's Cricket Club is the brainchild of Australia's ambassador to the Holy See, John McCarthy. He described it as an example of "sporting diplomacy" which would present the opportunity to play the Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. The next stage is to select an official cricket team. Mr McCarthy estimates that there are between 250 and 350 potential players from around the world studying in seminaries and religious universities in Rome - many of them from cricket loving countries. The board will stage a limited-overs tournament which will give students and priests a chance to compete for a place on the team, to be known as the Vatican XI. The team will sport the official colours of the tiny city-state - yellow and white. Their jackets will have the seal of the papacy - two crossed keys. Speaking at the launch, Monsignor Melchor Sanchez, who is the honorary president of St Peter's Cricket Club said "this represents the council's desire to go to the peripheries of the world that Pope Francis has spoken of." And the chairman of the club, Father Theodore Mascarenhas, an Indian priest known for his off-spin bowling, was confident about the Church's skills. "The team will be strong enough to beat anyone in the world," Father Mascarenhas said. Pope Francis is known to like football. He is a fan of the San Lorenzo football club in his native Argentina. But Father Mascarenhas said the Pope - who he described as an open man - would embrace a new sport. "I think cricket is another thing that would be part of that openness." The St Peter's Cricket Club has already laid down its first challenge to the Church of England and asked for a match at Lord's in September next year. </body>

      <body>A cemetery in the US state of Ohio has angered the family of a military veteran by removing a SpongeBob SquarePants headstone from her grave. Kimberly Walker's loved ones erected a 7ft (3.7m) stone of her favourite cartoon character wearing an Army uniform with her name and rank. The cemetery in the city of Cincinnati initially approved the headstone, then said it was not appropriate. Walker's family want the memorial to be put back. The cemetery said it would refund the $26,000 (£16,000) spent on the headstone and a near-exact copy for a plot for Ms Walker's living twin sister, and pay for new ones. "We've decided that they aren't appropriate for our historic cemetery and they can't be displayed here," Spring Grove cemetery president Gary Freytag said. The employee who approved the headstones made an inexplicable error in judgment, he added. They said they would discuss a compromise with the Walker family, including a more traditional gravestone bearing a small likeness of SpongeBob SquarePants. Walker, who served two tours in Iraq in 2006 and 2010 as a petroleum supply specialist, was 28 years old when she was found strangled and beaten to death in a Colorado hotel room in February. Her Army sergeant boyfriend was arrested and charged with her death. Her twin, Kara Walker, said: "For them not to accommodate and respect what my sister sacrificed, not only for my family, but for everyone else in this country, really bothers me." </body>

      <body>The US economy added 148,000 jobs in September, official figures show, lower than analysts had predicted. The unemployment rate fell to 7.2%, down from 7.3% in August, the US Department of Labor said. The release of the figures was delayed by the partial shutdown of the US government earlier this month. Economists had predicted 180,000 job gains for September, and the lower-than-expected figure could raise fears the US economy is losing momentum. Employment in professional and business services grew at the fastest pace with 32,000 new jobs added. Leisure and hospitality was the only sector to see a fall with 13,000 jobs lost. Carl Leahey, senior adviser at Decision Economics, said the report was "so-so", and meant the US central bank was likely to continue its massive $85bn-a-month economic stimulus programme. "This report will soften people's assessments of current conditions. With the possibility of a replay of the budget showdown as early as mid-January, why would the Fed want to pull any levers now?," he said. Following the figures, stock markets turned higher, with the FTSE 100 up 0.5% at 6,688 and both the Dow futures and broader SandP index futures up 0.3%, as investors bet on the Fed continuing its stimulus programme at the same pace. The dollar fell, under pressure from the expectation that the stimulus programme, which effectively creates more dollars, will continue at the same rate. The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, maintained its economic stimulus programme last month, suggesting it was still uncertain about the strength of the economic recovery. "Today's underperforming jobs number fully justifies September's cautious FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee)," said Joseph Trevisani, chief market strategist at WorldwideMarkets. The Labor Department said the next US unemployment data would be released on 8 November, a week later than scheduled due to the partial shutdown of the US government. Its workers were placed on unpaid leave during the shutdown raising fears the department will struggle to collect accurate data for October. "The October survey will be compromised by the late survey and the unquantifiable indirect private sector job losses triggered by the shutdown, and the November numbers will be compromised by the recovery - we hope - of those same jobs," said Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics. </body>

      <body>Authorities in Nevada are weighing prosecuting the parents of a 12-year-old who shot a teacher dead and wounded two classmates before killing himself. Officials in the city of Sparks have not identified the boy but believe the weapon came from his home. He opened fire at Sparks Middle School on Monday, killing maths teacher and Afghanistan veteran Michael Landsberry. Police say Landsberry, 45, was shot as he tried to coax the boy to drop the gun. "I cannot express enough appreciation for Mr Landsberry," Washoe County Schools Superintendent Pedro Martinez said on Tuesday. "He truly is a hero." The two wounded children are expected to recover. Officials are still working to determine how the boy, who was enrolled at the school, gained access to a semi-automatic handgun. Police say the boy's parents are co-operating with investigators. "We have been in contact with the parents of the suspect in this matter and out of respect for them, we will not be releasing the identity of the shooter," Sparks Deputy Police Chief Tom Miller said at a news conference. "They are grieving parents and are going through a very challenging, difficult time." When asked if the parents would face charges, Mr Miller said, "That is basically a question for the local prosecutor. But the potential is there." The incident occurred at 07:15 local time on Monday (14:15 GMT) shortly before the scheduled start of classes. As many as 200 police officers responded to the scene, authorities said. </body>

      <body>Hundreds of people have been evacuated from coastal communities in western Mexico that could lay in the path of Hurricane Raymond. Raymond is currently stalled some 135km (85 miles) off Mexico's Pacific coast and has weakened to a category 2 hurricane. But the authorities asked locals not to let their guard down as heavy rains continued and could set off landslides. A hurricane warning remains in place from Tecpan to Lazaro Cardenas. Torrential rains are forecast to continue for the next 24 hours in the western states of Guerrero and Michoacan. The area is still struggling to recover after it was hit by Tropical Storm Manuel last month. Manuel and Ingrid, another storm which hit Mexico almost at the same time, left more than 150 people dead and caused billions of dollars of damage. The governor of Guerrero state, Angel Aguirre, warned that Raymond's movements were "erratic" and "completely unpredictable" and could still head towards the coast. More than 1,000 people have been evacuated from villages clinging to perilous hillsides and schools remained closed for some 35,000 pupils. In the aftermath of Tropical Storm Manuel an entire village was buried under a landslide in the mountains of Guerrero, and the memory of that disaster has made locals more wary. A resident of Zihuatanejo, where forecasters said Raymond could make landfall, told the Agence France-Presse news agency she was not taking any chances. "When I heard the mayor's warning on the radio, I didn't hesitate, I grabbed my children and went down in a civil protection truck," Bartola Hernandez said. </body>

      <description>Venezuelan divers recover the remains of five bodies from a crashed plane believed to have been carrying Italian fashion boss Vittorio Missoni.</description>

      <body>Divers searching for Italian fashion boss Vittorio Missoni have taken samples from five bodies they found in the wreckage of a plane in the Caribbean, Venezuelan officials say. Venezuelan Attorney General Luisa Ortega said it could take up to a month to identify the remains. But she said that the luggage found in the plane indicated they were those of Mr Missoni, his wife and friends. The group disappeared on 4 January on a flight from Los Roques islands. Mr Missoni, 58, his wife Maurizia Castiglioni, and their Italian friends Guido Foresti and Elda Scalvenzi had been on holiday on Los Roques. They were flying back to Caracas when the plane flown by Venezuelan pilots Hernan Merchan and Jose Ferrer lost touch with the control tower some 10 nautical miles off Los Roques. The last radar report showed the aircraft accelerating at a height of 1,650m (5,400ft) before it rapidly lost altitude and speed, veering to the right until it disappeared from the radar. Following the plane's disappearance, investigators from the Italian Agency for Air Safety (ANSV) said the company that owned the small plane was not fully licensed to operate. The plane's wreckage was spotted in June at a depth of 75m (250ft), but Venezuelan navy divers were only able to reach it over the past 10 days. The divers said they also located a sixth body, but were not able to extract any samples from it because it was too difficult to access. Ms Ortega said that the DNA tests "could take 48 hours, but also up to a month, depending on the quality of the samples". Mr Missoni was the son of the fashion brand's founder, Ottavio Missoni, and co-owned the firm with his siblings. </body>

      <description>Mozambique's opposition Renamo attacks a police station in the central town of Maringue a day after annulling a 1992 peace accord, officials say.</description>

      <body>Mozambique's opposition Renamo movement has attacked a police station in the central town of Maringue a day after annulling a 1992 peace accord with the government, officials say. Police are said to have fled their posts after gunmen opened fire and there are no reports of casualties. A Renamo spokesman said party leader Afonso Dhlakama had "lost control of the situation". On Monday, the army captured Mr Dhlakama's base, forcing him to flee. About a million people were killed in Mozambique's civil war. The conflict ended in 1992 when Renamo and the Frelimo government signed a peace accord. After the seizure of Mr Dhlakama's Sathunjira base on Monday, Renamo said it had pulled out of the peace deal. However, its 51 MPs have not withdrawn from parliament. The clashes have raised fears among many Mozambicans that the civil war could resume, threatening stability and the economic boom the southern Africa state is currently experiencing, reports the BBC's Jose Tembe from the capital, Maputo. However, some people trust the army, he adds. Mozambique's President Armando Guebuza addressed rallies in central Mozambique on Tuesday, urging people to remain calm. State-run Radio Mozambique quoted a police source as saying that Renamo fighters attacked the police station in Maringue, about 35km (20 miles) from Mr Dhlakama's former base in central Sofala province. The attack was intense, but there were no casualties, Radio Mozambique reported. A teacher in Meringue, Romao Martins, told AFP news agency that residents had fled their homes during the assault. Schools have also shut amid fears that the violence could escalate, AFP reports. "The situation is horrible here. Early this morning, armed men supposed to be Renamo, attacked and it was a mess," Mr Martins is quoted as saying. "For one hour, shooting could be heard from all directions and people fled from their homes." On Monday, defence ministry spokesman Cristovao Chume said government forces had taken control of Mr Dhlakama's base in response to an earlier attack on an army post by Renamo fighters. He confirmed that Mr Dhlakama had fled. Renamo spokesman Fernando Mazanga said that government soldiers had bombarded the Sathunjira base with heavy weapons before occupying it. "Peace is over in the country... The responsibility lies with the Frelimo government because they didn't want to listen to Renamo's grievances," Mr Mazanga told Reuters news agency. Our correspondent says it is unclear whether Renamo intends to withdraw its members from parliament. A Renamo MP told him that no official position had as yet been taken, he adds. The government has repeatedly accused Renamo of trying to drag the country back to war, an allegation it denies. In April, at least five people were killed in central Mozambique after Renamo members attacked a police post. A force of about 300 Renamo men has remained armed since the peace accord, despite efforts to integrate them into the army or police force. Mr Dhlakama has said he needs his own personal bodyguards, and the men usually stay in his war-time camp in the Gorongosa mountains in centre of the country. After the civil war ended, Mr Dhlakama moved out of the camp to live in Maputo and later in the northern Nampula province But he returned to the mountains last year, saying he needed to be close to his men who were feeling ignored. Mozambique is due to hold local elections in November, and presidential and parliamentary elections next year. Frelimo has governed Mozambique since independence in 1975. Renamo, which was formed around the same time, was backed by the white minority governments in neighbouring South Africa and what is now Zimbabwe. </body>

      <description>A brigade of Libyan former rebels in Benghazi detains several people accused of carrying out attacks during a recent wave of violence in the city.</description>

      <body>A brigade of former rebels in the Libyan city of Benghazi has detained several people they say carried out recent car bombings in the city. Most of those held are foreigners, including several from Chad. But a military source told the BBC that the brigade had no official authority, and had made the arrests in an effort to show that it could provide security. Benghazi has seen frequent bombings and assassinations since Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in an uprising in 2011. Libya is due to mark the second anniversary of the former leader's fall on Wednesday. The arrests were made on Monday by the Martyrs' brigade of Libya, said Abdullah al-Zaidi of the Benghazi Joint Operations Room - a security force set up jointly by the ministries of defence and interior. The brigade is essentially a militia made up of former rebels against Gaddafi's rule, the BBC's Rana Jawad reports from the capital, Tripoli. Mr Zaidi said those held were part of a network and that they had confessed to at least 15 car bombings in the eastern city. A local TV station showed three people reported to be from neighbouring Chad standing against a wall following their detention. They were said to be mercenaries recruited by Gaddafi supporters. Mr Zaidi has given conflicting accounts on the number of people arrested and their nationalities in the past 24 hours. The Libyan military source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, called the arrests a "theatrical act". "These armed groups are trying to show that... they can replace the army," he said. "They sacrificed migrant workers for their propaganda. "Most of the perpetrators of these attacks are known to us and by the people, but the officials don't want to say... There is a fear of announcing who is behind all this." No-one has yet said they carried out the recent attacks in Benghazi. On average, there has been one attack every week. On social media, some Libyans suggested that the arrests might be a cover up for local groups, including hardline Islamists who are widely suspected of being responsible for much of the violence. </body>

      <body>China's CCTV News has deleted an "incorrect" tweet on its account that said a former security chief is being investigated for corruption. CCTV claimed its Twitter account had been hacked after the post reported that President Xi Jinping had set up a unit to investigate Zhou Yongkang. The episode will embarrass the state broadcaster and fuels rumours that have swirled for months about Mr Zhou. China blocks Twitter - some state media use it to reach foreign audiences. "President Xi Jinping has set up a special unit to investigate corruption allegations against the retired leader Zhou Yongkang," read the swiftly deleted tweet, according to a screen grab on freeweibo.com, which is run by an anti-censorship site, greatfire.org. The tweet, which appeared on Monday evening, seemed to refer to an article in Hong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper. Within a couple of hours the tweet had been removed. "The CCTV News Twitter account was targeted on 21 October and used illegally to post incorrect information copied from other sources," CCTV said through its English-language Twitter account. "The unauthorised information was deleted." Reuters news agency quoted CCTV spokeswoman Zhang Xiaojian as confirming that one of the broadcaster's Twitter accounts had been hacked, but did not elaborate. The CCTV Twitter account has more than 2,500 followers. In contrast, it has 9.9 million followers on its main account on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter. Mr Zhou retired from the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee during a sweeping leadership reshuffle last November. The reports that he is under investigation for alleged corruption have not been officially confirmed. President Xi has identified corruption as a threat to the survival of the ruling Communist Party, and has promised to crack down on both high-flying "tigers" and lowly "flies". </body>

      <body>The Australian Capital Territory has become the first part of Australia to legalise same-sex marriage. The ACT parliament passed a bill that will allow gay couples to marry, after a short debate on Tuesday. Celebrants will now be allowed to marry same-sex couples inside the ACT, regardless of which state they live in. Federal law, however, specified in 2004 that marriage was between a man and a woman, and the federal government is expected to challenge the move. The move was passed in the 17-member ACT Legislative Assembly, backed by Labor and the Greens, with the Liberals voting against. "There is no longer any excuse, if there ever was, to discriminate against same-sex couples in our community," ACT Chief Minister Katy Gallagher told the parliament. "They are our children, our parents, our brothers, our sisters, our leaders, our business people, our mentors and our colleagues." "More than anything, they are our equals. The Marriage Equality Act puts this fundamental principle and human right into law," the Australian Broadcasting Corporation quoted her as saying. Ms Gallagher said that the first weddings could take place by the end of the year. Attorney-General George Brandis, however, says the local law will face a legal challenge, because it is inconsistent with the national-level Marriage Act. "It would be very distressing to individuals who may enter into a ceremony of marriage under the new ACT law, and to their families, to find that their marriages were invalid," a statement from the Attorney-General's Office said. The ACT bill was amended shortly before it passed in an attempt to strengthen it against a potential challenge. Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who leads a Liberal-National coalition, opposes same-sex marriage. His sister, however, has recently disclosed that she is engaged to her female partner. Last year, a bill allowing same-sex marriage was voted down in both houses of Australia's national parliament. </body>

      <title>Critics dismiss new data legislation</title>
      <description>Major new European data-protection laws may have serious loopholes, say critics.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24622919</url>

      <body>Critics have said new European data-protection laws have loopholes that could render the legislation useless. The rules are the first attempt to create strong data-protection laws for Europe's 500 million citizens. They include a clause to strengthen online privacy in the wake of whistleblower Edward Snowden's allegations about US spying. They also set out ways citizens can erase their personal data - the so-called right to be forgotten. Lawmakers have toughened the initial draft regulation, prepared by the European Commission, to make sure companies no longer share European citizens' data with authorities of another country, unless explicitly allowed by EU law or an international treaty. This is a direct response to allegations from former intelligence analyst Edward Snowden about the US National Security Agency (NSA) snooping on European citizens' data. Another clause seeks to limit user profiling, requiring companies to explain their use of personal data in detail to customers and to seek prior consent. To ensure that the regulation is properly applied, most businesses would have to designate or hire data-protection officers. After 18 months of fierce industry lobbying, the legislation was passed with a 49-3 committee vote, with one abstention. The European Parliament still needs to hold another vote and seek agreement with the EU's 28 member states though — which is likely to result in some changes. "Tonight's vote sends a clear signal - as of today, data protection is made in Europe," said EU justice commissioner Viviane Reding. But French consumer group La Quadrature du Net was disappointed with the draft law. "There are some big loopholes that could void the effectiveness of the whole legislation," said Jeremie Zimmermann, from the organisation. He said vague wording such as "legitimate interest" could allow businesses to "exonerate themselves from the legislation". "A business could say that it is a legitimate interest to collect data in order to provide a better service for consumers or to enable it to make money," he said. He was also surprised that the rules around data profiling were not tougher. "Machines that crunch data are used to make important decisions such as who can get a job, who can get a loan, who can get insurance," he said. "This legislation allows firms to continue to collect and process more data and profile individuals." Bridget Treacy, partner and head of UK privacy and cyber-security at law firm, Hunton and Williams thinks that companies will have to ring the changes in order to comply with the legislation. "It enhances consumer rights and means businesses are going to have to focus on making sure they know what data they've got and what they do with it," she said. "One of the requirements of the legislation is that companies only collect the minimum amount of data that they require for a specific purpose. Firms are going to have to be much clearer about what data they are collecting and why." "It means that they will not be able to hold on to data as a bit of a comfort blanket," she added. Companies that fail to comply with the new law could be subject to a fine of up to 5% of their annual turnover — which could be hundreds of millions of dollars, or even a few billion dollars for internet giants such as Google. Now begins a long process during which the approved legislation will be debated among between the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council. It is expected to be concluded in March. </body>

      <body>An Italian court has halved the amount of alimony payments that former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi must pay to his ex-wife, Italian media report. Berlusconi - one of Italy's richest men - will now give the equivalent of $1.9m (£1.17m) a month to Veronica Lario and their three children. Ms Lario, a former actress, filed for divorce in 2009. Berlusconi said the three judges who had issued the earlier "unreal" verdict were "feminists and communists". The couple met in a dressing room in 1980 after Berlusconi saw Ms Lario strip during a performance in a theatre in Milan. They wed in 1990 and were married for 22 years. The former prime minister has been embroiled in a series of financial and sex scandals. Ms Lario demanded an apology for one of his flirtations in a letter carried on the front page of national newspaper La Repubblica in 2007. She began divorce proceedings in 2009 after her husband attended the birthday party of an 18-year-old aspiring model. She accused him of consorting with minors. Berlusconi lamented the end of the marriage, which he called his "love story". In December 2012, a court ordered the billionaire media tycoon to pay Ms Lario more than $4m a month. But Italian media are reporting that a review has now led to the alimony payments being cut in half. Economic conditions were cited as a reason for the reduction to the alimony payments initially established by a Milan court, according to the Corriere della Sera. Berlusconi, 77, has two other children from his first marriage. He is engaged to Francesca Pascale, who is in her 20s. </body>

      <body>A Palestinian militant has been shot dead by Israeli troops in the West Bank, the Israeli army has said. Mohammad Assi, a member of Islamic Jihad, was killed during a gunfight near the village of Bilin, army spokesman Lt Col Peter Lerner said. Assi reportedly exchanged fire for several hours with the soldiers from a cave after escaping an arrest raid. He was suspected of planning a bomb attack on a bus in Tel Aviv on 21 November 2012 that injured 29 people. The attack happened at the end of an eight-day conflict between Israel and militants in the Gaza Strip. "Mohammed Assi was hiding out in various places over the last year trying to avoid detection. This morning his running came to an abrupt end," Col Lerner wrote on Twitter. Israel Radio reported that two associates were arrested in the initial Israeli operation in Bilin in the early hours of Tuesday morning, but that Assi escaped and sought refuge in a nearby cage. The troops surrounded the cave for a number of hours, during which there were exchanges of fire. At one point, a rocket-propelled grenade was launched at the troops, according to Israel Radio. Assi was eventually shot after refusing calls to surrender, it added. Islamic Jihad said he had been one of its members, and that he was "assassinated by the occupation in Kufr Nemeh", a village near Bilin. Two months ago, three Palestinians were shot dead in clashes that erupted when Israeli troops tried to detain a suspect in the Qalandiya refugee camp. </body>

      <body>Egypt's state prosecutor has referred four policemen to trial over the deaths of 37 Islamist detainees in August. The officers, including the deputy chief of a Cairo police station, have been charged with manslaughter. The detainees died as a result of suffocation when tear gas was fired into the back of a vehicle transporting 45 of them to a prison outside Cairo. Security officials initially said they had tried to escape, but prosecutors found no evidence to support the claim. The incident sparked international condemnation, with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon saying he was "deeply disturbed" by the deaths and calling for a "full investigation". It took place four days after hundreds of people were killed when security forces cleared two sit-ins in the capital by supporters of President Mohammed Morsi, who was ousted by the military in July. Thousands of Islamists have since been detained, including Mr Morsi and other senior leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood, who have been charged with inciting murder and violence. The detainees who died on 18 August were among 45 being transported to Abu Zabal prison in a vehicle designed to carry only 24 people, the Reuters news agency quoted a prosecution statement as saying. The state-run al-Ahram newspaper said on its website that the state prosecutor had ordered the four policemen charged with their manslaughter to be remanded in custody. </body>

      <title>Major calls for energy windfall tax</title>
      <description>Former prime minister Sir John Major calls for a windfall tax on the profits of the UK's top energy firms.</description>

      <body>Former prime minister Sir John Major has called for an emergency tax on the profits of the UK's top energy firms. The ex-Conservative leader said recent price rises of more than 10% were "unacceptable" and action was needed. The government could claw back the cost of extra winter fuel payments through a one-off tax, he suggested. Downing Street said there was no such plan but called Sir John's comments "interesting". Energy firms said they were helping customers keep bills down. Ministers have rejected a call by Labour leader Ed Miliband for a price freeze, describing it as a "con" and urging hard-pressed consumers to switch suppliers instead. Three of the "big six" energy firms - Npower, SSE, and British Gas - have announced plans to raise gas and electricity bills by between 8% and 10%. Analysts expect the others - Scottish Power, E.On and EDF - to follow suit with similar price increases. Speaking at a lunch for political journalists, Sir John - prime minister between 1990 and 1997 - said price rises of this kind were not justified and it would be "entirely reasonable" for the government to impose a one-off levy to recover the cost of cold weather payments this winter. Cold weather payments are triggered when the temperature falls below a certain level for a prolonged period. Those on income support and other work-related benefits are eligible for a £25 payment if temperatures drop to zero degrees Celsius or below for seven consecutive days. Fuel poverty campaigners have said the price rises will leave some people with the choice of having to "heat or eat" this winter but energy firms say they are needed to cover the cost of rising wholesale prices and environmental obligations. Asked about Labour's plan for price freeze if it is elected in 2015, Sir John said "Ed Miliband's heart was in the right place but his head has gone walkabout", adding that the plan was unworkable. "But he did touch on an issue that's very important. The private sector is something the Conservative party support but when the private sector goes wrong or behaves badly I think it is entirely right to make changes and put it right. "At the moment I do not see how it can be in any way acceptable that with energy prices rising broadly 4% in terms of costs that the price to the consumer should rise by the 9-10% that we are hearing." He later told the BBC that the was a "crisis" in the energy market and there was a "very real chance" that the government would have to increase the amount of assistance it gave to people in the event of cold snap. Should this happen, he said a "one-off retrospective" tax should be considered "given the scale of their (energy firms') profits and the unjustified nature of the price increases they have just proposed". The BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said the prime minister and his chancellor were instinctively opposed to short-term fixes and believed only action on competition and supply would reduce bills. But he said intervention from such a senior figure would increase pressure on them to do something. In response to the ex-PM's comments, Ed Miliband tweeted: "Sir John Major makes Labour's argument: David Cameron stands up for the energy companies not hard-pressed families." Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint said the former PM was "joining a chorus of voices who are concerned about the way the public has been left out of pocket". But she said Labour opposed a windfall tax, as it would be complicated and it was unclear how it would benefit consumers, while a price freeze was a "simple measure" to give consumers immediate respite. The government has said the price rises are "disappointing" but has insisted a price freeze could actually lead to higher prices in the long-term and what is needed is more competition. "There are a number of initiatives that the government has to support vulnerable people, such as the cold weather payments," a No 10 spokesman said. "We have a range of ways in which support is given and those are the right ones." Conservative business minister Michael Fallon said: "It's an interesting idea but we think a faster way to bear down on prices is more competition, simpler tariffs and making it much easier for people to switch to a cheaper supplier." The Energy UK trade association said: "No one should be afraid to put the heating on this winter. If customers are worried they should get in touch with their energy supplier and they should be able to help. "The energy industry is doing an increasing amount to help vulnerable customers and we will be looking at what more can be done to help people worried about their bills." The bosses of the leading energy firms have been called to appear before MPs next week to explain the price rises. Earlier on Tuesday, Scottish Power was told to pay £8.5m to many of its customers after being found to have misled them about the benefits of switching to alternative suppliers and other breaches of its licence obligations. More than 140,000 customers on the warm homes discount schemes, designed to support those at risk of fuel poverty, will receive about £50 in compensation each. </body>

      <title>'Go home' vans not good idea - May</title>
      <description>Vans telling illegal immigrants to "go home" or face arrest will not be rolled out across the UK, Home Secretary Theresa May says.</description>

      <body>Theresa May has said vans telling illegal immigrants to "go home" or face arrest will not be rolled out across the UK. A trial of the controversial vans in London is still being evaluated. But the home secretary told MPs she accepted they had "not been a good idea" and were too much of a "blunt instrument". Labour said Mrs May must take responsibility for the "complete failure" of the policy. Explaining her decision to ditch the campaign in the Commons, the home secretary said: "What I've done is looked at the interim evaluation in relation to the plans - and there were some returns achieved as a result of that. "Politicians should be willing to step up to the plate and say when they think something actually hasn't been as good an idea, and I think they were too blunt an instrument." But she defended government attempts to tighten up immigration enforcement when people overstay their visas, which she said had resulted in "something around 4,000 people leaving the UK". The government pilot, which saw vans driving around parts of London for a week in July, drew criticism from across the political spectrum. Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable described the campaign as "stupid" while UKIP said the scheme was "disturbing" and reminiscent of a fascist dictatorship. The vans were also criticised by the Advertising Standards Authority, which said the arrest statistics on them were misleading, although the watchdog cleared the campaign of being offensive and irresponsible. During the campaign, the vans drove around the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow - all ethnically diverse areas where it is thought a lot of illegal immigrants live and work. The poster displayed a picture of handcuffs and read: "In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest." Home Office ministers insisted the pilot had worked - and they were considering extending it elsewhere. Speaking earlier this month, Police Minister Damian Green said the "hard-hitting" campaign had "let people know that 'the traditional view that if you have been here illegally nothing would happen to you' is not the case". The Lib Dems say they were not consulted about the idea and would have opposed it had they known, and party president Tim Farron has suggested they should take credit for not allowing it to go any further. "This is a failed project and the Home Office should hold their hands up and admit it was wrong both practically and morally," he said. But Labour said it "beggared belief" that the Lib Dems were trying to "claim victory for ending a policy that they signed off in the first place". Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said her Conservative counterpart must take responsibility for the "complete failure" of the idea. "You agreed to that slogan," she said during heated exchanges in the Commons. "And you agreed to send it round communities whose parents heard it from the National Front in the 1970s and whose British citizens work in our public services, build our businesses and fight in our armed forces today. "You signed this policy off, you defended it, all for the sake of one person returning. You should be better than that. I hope you are ashamed of what you did. "You should confirm that you will never pursue such divisive gimmicks again. It is beneath you and it ought to be beneath this government." Conservative MP Henry Smith told the BBC's Daily Politics it had been an idea "worth looking at" but it had been practically flawed and made "people less willing to report if they were in the country illegally rather than more willing". A request by the BBC to see the Home Office's initial evaluation of the pilot has been turned down. The BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani requested information about the response to the ad campaign, under Freedom of Information laws. But he was told the details were intended for "future publication" and therefore were exempt from disclosure rules. It is not clear when the study will be published. </body>

      <title>Nokia reveals phablets and tablets</title>
      <description>Two Windows Phone phablets and a Windows RT tablet are among the final devices unveiled by Nokia ahead of the sale of its hardware unit to Microsoft.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24608498</url>
      <date>1382455107</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70623000/jpg/_70623410_noka.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Nokia has unveiled its first phablets - extra-large phones - as well as its first tablet computer. The Windows Phone handsets introduce the ability to change which objects in a photo are in focus after it is taken. The Windows RT tablet has a 4G data chip, unlike Microsoft's recently unveiled Surface 2. Nokia World in Abu Dhabi is likely to be remembered as the Finnish firm's last major event before it completes the sale of its hardware unit. Microsoft agreed to buy the business for 5.4bn euros ($7.4bn; £4.6bn) in a deal which the companies have said should be finalised by early 2014. Nokia's former chief executive Stephen Elop, who resigned to become head of the company's devices and services division until his transfer to Microsoft, admitted to the BBC that choosing Windows Phone rather than Android as an operating system had presented the company with "a very difficult challenge." "It's been hard. It's a very difficult challenge; it's a very competitive environment, but we're pleased with the fact that we're building momentum," he said. One analyst said the sale should aid the US firm's efforts to promote its mobile platforms against the market leaders, Google Android and Apple iOS. "For the last two years Microsoft and Nokia's marketing efforts have jarred against each other at times - having one big effort should be better than two smaller ones," said Martin Garner, from the consultancy CCS Insight. "Microsoft can also spend a lot more marketing the devices than Nokia could. That does seem to be a key criteria - both Samsung and Apple's spends are very high indeed." Microsoft's share of the handset and tablet markets is growing but from a relatively low level, according to market research firm Gartner. Windows Phone took a 3.3% share of smartphone sales in the April-to-June quarter, said the firm, with Nokia proving the most popular brand. It also forecast that about 1.7% of all tablets shipped over 2013 as a whole would be powered by either Windows RT or the full Windows 8 operating system. Nokia showed off two phablets at the UAE launch. Both the Lumia 1520 and Lumia 1320 feature 6in (15.2cm) displays, allowing extra rows of apps to be displayed on their home screens than possible on smaller models. The firm said that the extra space would also make it easier to use the phones' touchscreen keyboards, suggesting this would appeal to business users who used productivity software. A new Beamer app will allow the phones to stream the contents of their screens onto to a web browser on a separate display. It works by sending data via Nokia's computer servers. Another new app - Refocus - lets owners determine which parts of a photograph are in focus and which are blurred after it is taken. The phones achieve this by taking a series of images in quick succession at different focus lengths rather than replicating the light field effect captured by a Lytro camera. Blackberry is among the other companies to have recently launched a phablet, but one expert said doubts about the Canadian firm's future meant that its existing users might be tempted to switch. "There's definitely a chance for Nokia to gain ground, of course everyone else is interested in that space too," said Mr Garner. "It's not a slam dunk, but Microsoft is as well placed as others - better in some respects." The Lumia 2520 becomes the only Windows RT tablet made by a manufacturer other than Microsoft. Dell, Asus, Lenovo, Acer and Samsung had all initially backed the platform only to later change tack. The operating system runs on an ARM-based chip allowing it to offer superior battery life to the full Windows 8 system running on tablets powered by x86 processors, but it does not support as many programs. Nokia's tablet is slightly more compact than Microsoft's version and also distinguishes itself by supporting an optional 4G Sim card. However, bearing in mind Microsoft has already taken a $900m writedown after weak sales of its original Surface RT tablet, one analyst questioned whether the firm would want to produce two competing models. "I don't think that having two devices in that space makes a lot of sense," said Carolina Milanesi, consumer devices analyst at Gartner. "I believe Microsoft may keep the Nokia model on as a cheaper consumer-targeted device focused on media consumption and gaming in order to capture more market share, and also keep on the more expensive Intel-based Surface Pro - but it will phase out the Surface 2 RT model." Nokia also added three models to its Asha range of low-end handsets targeted at emerging markets and shoppers on a budget. They run Nokia's proprietary Series 40 OS rather than Windows Phone. The most expensive of the devices, the Asha 530, now supports 3G data in addition to 2G, allowing faster internet access. "It's important for Nokia and Microsoft to connect the next billion people," said Mr Elop, suggesting that Microsoft would find Asha's popularity a convenient way to promote other services such as its Skydrive cloud storage product. But one market watcher questioned Asha's future. "There's still quite a lot of demand for Asha in developing markets where the phones offer brand-value against other low-cost mass-market handsets," said Chris Green from the Davies Murphy Group consultancy. "So, there's no sense to killing the business while it remains highly profitable. "But will it be a core focus? Absolutely not. It will be a distraction and Microsoft will be keen to migrate users to the Windows Phone platform." </body>

      <title>Starbucks prices criticised in China</title>

      <body>The world's largest coffee chain, Starbucks, has come under fire in China for reportedly charging locals higher prices than in other major markets. The official China Central Television (CCTV) claimed Starbucks earns higher margins in China due to its pricing. Starbucks is the latest foreign company to come under scrutiny from Chinese media over its pricing practices. Earlier this year, Apple and Nestle were also put under pressure to review their prices or customer service. Starbucks is rapidly expanding in China, which is set to overtake Canada as its second-biggest market next year. In the CCTV report that aired on Sunday, it said a medium-size latte in Beijing costs 27 yuan (£2.70;$4.43), or about one-third more than at a Starbucks in Chicago. "Starbucks has been able to enjoy high prices in China, mainly because of the blind faith of local consumers in Starbucks and other Western brands," Wang Zhendong, director of the Coffee Association of Shanghai, told CCTV. Starbucks said its prices reflect higher food and logistical costs in China. The issue became one of the most popular talking points on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter, where many users seemed to rally to Starbucks' side. "Those who are saying Starbucks is expensive are probably those who don't drink much coffee," one user said. "The prices are competitive and the quality makes people feel safe." </body>

      <body>China's four major cities saw record rise in new home prices in September, stoking fears of a housing bubble. Prices in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou saw their biggest jump since the government changed its calculation method in January 2011. Property remains a popular investment choice in China and prices have now risen for nine months in a row. Analysts say Beijing has so far held back on imposing fresh curbs due to concerns over slowing economic growth. However, data released last week showed that China's growth rate picked up in the July-to-September period - the first rise in three quarters. Many believe that with the economy picking up and property prices continuing to rise, policymakers may soon implement measures to control speculation in the sector and also keep price rises in check. Data released by the by China's National Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday showed that new home prices rose in 69 of China's 70 major cities in September. In the capital city of Beijing, new home prices were 16% higher in September than they were a year earlier. In Shanghai, prices rose by 17% compared to a year earlier. The southern manufacturing-based cities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou saw prices rise by 20%. The eastern city of Wenzhou was the only Chinese city to post a decline. Prices fell by 1.7% from last year. </body>

      <title>Why Beckham had to go - Ferguson</title>

      <body>Sir Alex Ferguson says David Beckham had to leave Manchester United because the former England captain thought he was "bigger than the manager". In his latest autobiography, Ferguson said he fell out with Beckham after criticising his performance during an FA Cup defeat by Arsenal in 2003. "The minute a Manchester United player thought he was bigger than the manager, he had to go," he wrote. "David thought he was bigger than Alex Ferguson. "That was the death knell for him." Ferguson also said he had concerns about Beckham's celebrity lifestyle, following the player's marriage to Victoria Adams, a member of the pop group the Spice Girls. "David was the only player I managed who chose to be famous, who made it his mission to be known outside the game," wrote Ferguson. "I felt uncomfortable with the celebrity aspect of his life." In a press conference on Tuesday to launch his book, Ferguson added: "He fell in love with Victoria - that changed everything." But he also praised Beckham for his contribution to United's success and called him an "icon to every kid in the world". Beckham, who won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups and one Champions League crown during his United career, was eventually sold to Real Madrid for £25m in the summer of 2003, before moving to the United States to play for LA Galaxy. As for Ferguson, he brought his career as United boss to a close in May, ending one of the most successful managerial reigns in British history. During his 26 years in charge at Old Trafford, he won 38 trophies and managed some of the biggest names in football, like Beckham, Eric Cantona, Cristiano Ronaldo, Peter Schmeichel, Bryan Robson, Roy Keane, Jaap Stam and Ruud Van Nistelrooy. Ferguson also writes in 'Alex Ferguson: My Autobiography' that: Ferguson also describes in detail his version of the dressing-room bust-up with Beckham that followed the FA Cup loss to Arsenal. "He was around 12 feet from me," wrote Ferguson. "David swore. I moved towards him and, as I approached, I kicked a boot. It hit him right above the eye. "Of course, he rose to have a go at me and the players stopped him. 'Sit down,' I said. 'You've let your team down. You can argue as much as you like.' "I called him in the next day to go through the video and he still would not accept his mistake. "The next day the story was in the press. It was in those days that I told the board David had to go." After helping Real Madrid win La Liga, Beckham moved to the United States in 2007, guiding LA Galaxy to victory in the MLS Cup. "I imagine he also had his eyes on Hollywood and the impact it would have on the next phase of his career," Ferguson added. "There was no footballing reason to go to America." Keane was another player who Ferguson decided was no longer wanted at Old Trafford. The Scot describes how his relationship deteriorated with the Republic of Ireland midfielder, to the point that he became a negative influence. "With Roy, there were episodes of great friction and drama as he tried to impose his will on the team," wrote Ferguson. "On one occasion, as I came in to the dressing room, Roy and Ruud van Nistelrooy were at it, hammer and tongs. They had to be pulled apart by the players." Keane left United in November 2005, just a few weeks after angering Ferguson for criticising team-mates in an interview for MUTV. Ferguson also allowed Ronaldo to leave Old Trafford in 2009, but only after Real Madrid had agreed to pay £80m for the winger. "Cristiano was the most gifted player I managed," wrote Ferguson. "He surpassed all the other great ones I coached at United - and I had many." Ronaldo had wanted to move to Real Madrid the previous summer, but Ferguson blocked a potential transfer because he was unhappy with the way Real president Ramon Calderon had behaved. Ferguson told Ronaldo he would rather "shoot" him than sell him to Real, claiming he would lose his "honour" if he agreed to a sale. However, the Scot promised to let the player leave the following year, which he did when Madrid made a world record bid. Ferguson, whose trophy haul at United includes 13 league titles, two Champions League crowns, five FA Cups and four League Cups, decided to quit as manager in May and was replaced by David Moyes. Under Moyes, who left Everton to take the Old Trafford job, the defending Premier League champions have made their worst league start in 24 years and lie eighth in the table, eight points adrift of leaders Arsenal. </body>

      <body>Serena Williams powered past Angelique Kerber in her opening match at the WTA Championships in Istanbul. The world number one broke the German's serve at the first opportunity in each set on the way to a 6-3 6-1 success. Second seed Victoria Azarenka was made to work hard for a 7-6 (7-4) 6-2 victory over Italian world number seven Sara Errani. Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska, seeded third, lost 6-4 6-4 to the Czech Republic's fifth seed Petra Kvitova. American Williams, already guaranteed to end the season on top of the world rankings, is aiming to become the first player to successfully defend the season-ending title since Justine Henin in 2007 and win a fourth crown overall. She was simply too strong for world number nine Kerber, conjuring 31 winners, but also mixing her game to win the point on each of the 14 occasions that she ventured to the net. "I feel really good," said Williams. "She's beaten me before so I was a little nervous and really focused. "I never usually say I'm happy about a match, but I am now and I'm excited about that. "It's such a tough tournament. Every match you have to be focused. I'm happy, but I have to get focused again." Williams's dominance was in contrast to the earlier struggles of Azarenka, who was 5-2 down to Errani in the first set before fighting back to take it on a tie-break in an hour and 28 minutes. Only when Errani called the trainer for treatment on a calf injury did matters become simpler for the Belarusian, with the two-time Australian Open champion winning the final four games to complete victory. Meanwhile, British number three Heather Watson claimed only a second win in two months with a hard-fought success over American Christina McHale at the ITF tournament in Poitiers, France. Watson, who reached a career-high ranking of 39 in February, has struggled since returning from a bout of glandular fever at the French Open in May and has slipped to 133. Dropping down from the WTA Tour to play one of the bigger events on the second tier, Watson lost the first set and, after fighting back, trailed 4-2 in the decider. But she won four successive games to come through 2-6 7-5 6-4. </body>

      <description>Roy Keane questions Sir Alex Ferguson's loyalty after the release of the ex-Manchester United's manager's autobiography.</description>

      <body>Roy Keane has questioned Sir Alex Ferguson's loyalty after comments made in the former Manchester United manager's autobiography. Former United captain Keane was strongly criticised in the book but told ITV: "I'm OK, quite relaxed. "I remember having conversations about loyalty when I was at the club. I don't think he knows the meaning of the word. "To constantly criticise other players that brought him success… I won't be losing any sleep over it." In his book, Ferguson claimed Irishman Keane, who played a key role in the club's success during his 12-year stay at Old Trafford, became an increasingly negative influence. The Scot wrote about Keane: "The hardest part of Roy's body is his tongue. He has the most savage tongue you can imagine. "He can debilitate the most confident person in the world in seconds. He was an intimidating, ferocious individual." Former Republic of Ireland midfielder Keane, 42, won seven Premier League titles, four FA Cups and the Champions League during his time at Old Trafford between 1993 and 2005. Ferguson also criticised other former United players including David Beckham, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Owen Hargreaves, as well as current Red Devils striker Wayne Rooney, in his new book, 'Alex Ferguson: My Autobiography'. Keane, who released his own autobiography in 2002, says such harsh judgements are unfair given the success and trophies he and his fellow players brought the club under Ferguson. "I just don't think the manager needs to do it. I'm not sure how many books he's written now," Keane said. "But he has to draw the line eventually and say, 'Listen, these players have all been top servants to Manchester United'. A lot of these players helped the manager win lots of trophies.

      <body>Singer Noel Harrison has died at his home in Devon, aged 79. The son of the actor Rex Harrison, he was best known for recording the hit song The Windmills Of Your Mind on The Thomas Crown Affair soundtrack. It won best song at the 1968 Oscars and was later covered by artists including Dusty Springfield. Harrison spent much of his life in America, as an actor and performer, but moved back to the UK in the last decade or so to live in South Devon. He once said, of recording The Windmills Of Your Mind: "It didn't seem like a big deal at the time. I went to the studio one afternoon and sang it and pretty much forgot about it." Harrison continued: "I didn't realise until later what a timeless, beautiful piece Michel LeGrand and the Bergmans had written. It turned out to be my most notable piece of work." After moving to the US, he starred in the TV series The Girl from UNCLE and had chart hits with A Young Girl and Suzanne, by Leonard Cohen. On his website he wrote: "I was part of the 'British Invasion' spearheaded by The Beatles. I bought a nice house in Los Angeles. "There was another US charts record and four years of endless TV appearances, theatre tours and star-studded social occasions." However he revealed he "didn't like being a celebrity" and spent his sixties mixing performing with construction work before moving back to the UK, adding, "I was well out of the goldfish bowl and I liked it." Harrison was born in London on 29 January 1934, to Rex Harrison and his mother, Collette Thomas, the first of six Mrs Rex Harrisons. They later divorced and he lived in Bude, Cornwall, with his mother's parents before she took him to live in the Swiss Alps at 15. Harrison never went to school again but indulged his passion for ski-racing instead, becoming British champion in 1953. He was married three times and had children and grandchildren from his first two marriages. An admirer of Jacques Brel, Harrison created a one-man musical, Adieu, Jacques in the 1980s and, in 2002, released an album of songs from the show. Harrison played Glastonbury Festival's Spirit of '71 stage in 2011, marking 40 years since his first appearance at the festival. </body>

      <title>Queen visits National Theatre at 50</title>
      <description>The Queen meets one of the puppets from stage show War Horse during her tour of the National Theatre as the institution celebrates its 50th birthday.</description>

      <body>The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have visited the National Theatre, as the institution celebrates its 50th birthday. During the tour, the Queen met one of the puppet horses from the NT's acclaimed production of War Horse. The Queen has previously seen the show, based on Michael Morpurgo's novel, which tells the story of Joey, a horse who serves in World War I. NT director Sir Nicholas Hytner said it had been "a very special day". Tuesday is 50 years to the day since the first National Theatre production. Peter O'Toole played Hamlet on 22 October 1963 at the Old Vic theatre, the NT's original home, under the direction of its founder Sir Laurence Olivier. Among the cast in that first performance was the 23-year-old actor Michael Gambon. Speaking at a 50th anniversary talk at the National's Olivier Theatre on Tuesday night, Sir Michael recalled: "I never had to speak. I was just at the back with a spear." He added: "I used to walk out of the stage door at night at the Old Vic and put myself just behind Sir Laurence as he was going out to his car to seem as though I was one of his friends." Actress Sheila Reid, who appeared in Olivier's Othello in 1964, said that appearing stage with Sir Laurence "was a bit like playing tennis with somebody better than yourself". The NT moved to its current home on the South Bank in 1976. More than 800 productions have taken place over the last 50 years, including premieres of plays by Tom Stoppard, Peter Shaffer, Harold Pinter, Alan Bennett and David Hare. During their visit on Tuesday, the Queen and Prince Philip were were given a tour by outgoing director Sir Nicholas Hytner. They heard a musical number from Guys and Dolls, the first musical staged to be staged at the National in 1982, and watched a rehearsal for the forthcoming production Emil And The Detectives, based on the story of a boy living in 1920s Berlin. Dame Joan Plowright, who was married to Sir Laurence Olivier when he led the National Theatre, also met the Queen. The actress said: "It's a very special day, it's quite hard not to feel quite emotional about it. "I remember what the day was like when it was about to open - the nerves and apprehension. It's a huge task to take on the first season of a new national theatre." Dame Joan added: "It's had quite a history - I would say more triumphs then disasters." The Queen also unveiled a plaque to mark her visit and the 50th anniversary. Tuesday's encounter with War Horse puppet Joey wasn't the first time the Queen had met the mechanical star of the show, which is in the West End and abroad. During the Diamond Jubilee River Thames pageant last summer, the Queen appeared to enjoy watching the animal running across the roof of the National Theatre, which first staged the play, as the royal barge sailed past. As her tour of the theatre company ended, she told the puppet horse: "It's lovely to see you again." Puppeteer Gareth Aled said after meeting the Queen: "She's familiar with horses and with Joey, it's a very lovely privilege to have that meeting, she knows horses probably better than we do." Joey walked up to the Queen and followed her as she walked to her waiting state limousine before rearing up on his hind legs as the car departed. Mr Aled added: "It's all about striving for realistic horse movement, every horse movement should feel life-like." The National Theatre's 50th year is being marked by a series of events, including a star-studded gala on 2 November which will be shown on BBC Two. Famous alumni including Dame Judi Dench, Simon Russell Beale, Sir Michael Gambon, Sir Derek Jacobi and Dame Maggie Smith will perform speeches from roles they have played there. Dame Maggie will reprise her role as Mrs Sullen in George Farquhar's comedy The Beaux' Stratagem, Russell Beale will return to Hamlet, while Dame Judi, who appeared in Antony and Cleopatra in 1987, will re-enact the elegy to Antony. "I'm frightened, but I'm thrilled to be part of it," Dame Judi told the BBC. Sir Nicholas Hytner even hinted to the Evening Standard that blockbuster show The History Boys, which launched the career of James Corden, could even make a return for the gala. Dame Judi said the institution was still "essential" as it celebrated its golden anniversary. "The place is absolutely buzzing with people," she told BBC entertainment correspondent Lizo Mzimba. "There are exhibitions, there is music, there are three theatres going. It's a very alive place. "We need that to stimulate our emotions. We need to see things that make us cry, laugh, think about something, be excited, be saddened, be angry. "We were so long without a National Theatre," she added, "and we've been very, very lucky." Sir Nicholas Hytner leaves the National Theatre in 2015, when he will be replaced by Rufus Norris, whose credits include The Amen Corner and Dr Dee: An English Opera. The role is widely regarded as the biggest job in British theatre. Norris, who was appointed last week, called it "a great honour". </body>

      <title>Unheard Bowie radio show to be aired</title>
      <description>A previously unheard radio show recorded by David Bowie to promote his album Pin Ups is to be broadcast for the first time in 40 years.</description>

      <body>A previously unheard radio show recorded by David Bowie to promote his album Pin Ups is to be broadcast for the first time in 40 years. The 15-minute mock radio show, made in 1973, will be aired on BBC Radio 6 Music on Wednesday. The show features five tracks from Pin Ups, a covers album that features Bowie and Twiggy on the sleeve. The recording was discovered by Nigel Reeve, who oversees Bowie's back catalogue. He said it was a "jaw-dropping" moment when he played it for the first time. The five songs in the show - The Pretty Things' Rosalyn, Them's Here Comes the Night, The Yardbirds' I Wish You Would, The Merseys' Sorrow and The Who's I Can't Explain - are interspersed with Bowie's own musings on the London music scene. The show was produced by Bowie and Ken Scott, who worked with Bowie on his albums from Hunky Dory through to Pin Ups. Reeve discovered the recording during research several years ago. "It was in an old tape vault on 1/4" tape with simply the words 'Radio Show' written on it," he said. "This is such a rare find. No one knew of its existence, apart from David and Ken. To play it for the first time was quite simply a jaw-dropping moment." Clips of the show will be broadcast across Wednesday on BBC 6 Music and will be available to listen to until midnight on Sunday 27 October. Presenter Shaun Keaveny said: "It's beyond exciting for 6 Music to be showcasing the first-ever airing of this historic recording, in a year that has been all about the Bowie comeback." David Bowie broke a 10-year silence in January, releasing a new single, Where Are We Now, completely out of the blue. It was the first sign of his 24th studio album The Next Day, recorded in secret over two years with long-time producer Tony Visconti. The album is nominated for the Mercury Music Prize, which will be announced on 30 October. "As a network showcasing music of alternative spirit, David Bowie is at our core," said James Stirling, Editor, 6 Music. "It's fantastic that our listeners will have the opportunity to hear this radio show for the first time ever." </body>

      <title>Drones kill rescuers in 'double tap', say activists</title>
      <description>Drones hit targets twice, killing rescuers, say activists</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24557333</url>

      <body>Drones are often lauded for their supposed precision and accuracy. Sometimes, though, the machines - and their human operators - make mistakes, as two new reports from human rights organisations show. The first round of missiles struck a tent in Zowi Sidgi, a village in North Waziristan, at dusk on 6 July 2012. A small group of miners and woodcutters had gathered there for dinner, according to Amnesty International's Mustafa Qadri. The tent burned. Friends and family members came running to help. A moment later, there was another drone strike. Many of the people who had come to assist their friends and relatives in the tent were also killed. Altogether 18 people died in the two rounds of drone strikes. One of the victims was a 14-year-old boy. The strikes in Zowi Sidgi fall into a special category of attacks, said Qadri, a lethal operation that includes two phases. For these attacks, the US relies on consecutive rounds of strikes - missiles are dropped, killing people. A moment later - when people in the area have raced to the scene to help the wounded, another round of missiles is dropped. This practice, known as a "double tap", as journalists have described, is being used more often. "They appear to be targeting those who have come in to help those who are injured," said Qadri. "And that's particularly shocking." His research appears in an Amnesty International report. In a May speech at Fort McNair in Washington, however, US President Barack Obama said the drone strikes in Pakistan and other countries are "effective" and "legal". "Before any strike is taken, there must be near certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured - the highest standard we can set," he said. A Human Rights Watch study on drone strikes in Yemen has also been released. For the Human Rights Watch report, researchers looked at six strikes that took place in Yemen from 2009-13. Researchers claim that two of the attacks violated the laws of war "because they struck only civilians or used indiscriminate weapons". More than 640 people have been killed in US-directed drone strikes in Yemen over the past decade, according to New America Foundation. During this period of time, about 2,065 people were killed in strikes in Pakistan. Most of the people who have been killed in the strikes were militants, as research done byaccording to New America Foundation has shown. But sometimes the wrong individuals are targeted. Americans rely on information gathered by the CIA, the National Security Agency and other US agencies, as documents from former contractor Edward Snowden reveal, to plan some of the strikes. Individuals who are planning the strikes use the information in order to determine whether or not to carry out an assault - and who should be targeted. When contacted by the BBC, CIA officials declined to comment. In addition Americans may rely on so-called "pattern of life" analysis, which means they study a group of people over time in order to see if they are doing anything suspicious. The definition can be broad. Indeed Qadri and other activists believe the definition is so vague that innocent people are killed as a result. "If you're a military-aged male, you're considered a target," he said. For the Amnesty International report, researchers interviewed more than 60 people, including individuals who saw the strikes in Pakistan occur. Some of the interviews were done in North Waziristan. Based on this research, Qadri and others believe the drone strike in Zowi Sidgi was wrong. "Let's assume the US made a mistake in the first strike," he said. "But in the second round it should have been clear that they were killing civilians. A child was killed. "It's up to the US to tell us why they were targeted," he said. "In the absence of that, it's an unlawful killing." </body>

      <title>Returning to Sudan's Abyei region to vote for secession</title>
      <description>Why Julia is risking her life in comfort to go back to Sudan</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24611597</url>

      <body>Fears are growing that violence could erupt once more in the disputed region of Abyei, claimed by both Sudan and newly independent South Sudan, as southerners plan to hold a unilateral referendum, reports Hannah McNeish from the area. With suitcases on heads and babies in arms, thousands of people are braving rivers of mud, bumpy truck rides and shelling out all their savings to get back to Abyei. Hailing from the Dinka Ngok ethnic group, they are determined to hold an unofficial referendum next week to decide whether the small heart-shaped area should be part of Sudan or join South Sudan. The move comes after both countries failed to meet a deadline to organise an internationally-backed referendum this month, threatening to poison the fragile peace between former civil war foes and once again send residents running for their lives. Julia William Deng, 23, gave up her nursing course, a 24/7 Facebook addiction and thousands of dollars to go back from Australia to Abyei, where power and water have dried up and many people displaced by violence live in flimsy, cramped huts. Sporting a tattoo representing the curse of Abyei, with a bird of peace but a flower that everyone wants to own, Ms Deng accepts that she is risking her life to return to an area rich in green pastures and oil but decimated by an ongoing, violent tug of war. "I know it's not safe for me, but at the end of the day, it's my place, it's my village where I belong," she says. Choking back the tears, Ms Deng says that she cannot escape the stories of orphans, widows and those sent mad by seeing family members killed in fighting in 2008 and 2011. "There's kids that told me stories that their mothers aren't alive, because of what happened… Every day, the story gets worse. The more I talk to people, the more they tell me about what happened to them." Abyei's Dinka Ngok residents are culturally and ethnically allied to South Sudan and backed its rebel army during decades of civil war against Khartoum's rule. However, the Arabic-speaking Misseriya people, who have traditionally grazed their cattle in Abyei and like the Dinka Ngok see it as their ancestral homeland, want to remain in Sudan. The two sides cannot agree on who is eligible to vote in the referendum and so it has not been held. A 2005 peace deal that paved the way for a Southern vote on independence in 2011 was supposed to give Abyei a separate referendum on whether to be part of Sudan or South Sudan. But in Abyei, ballot boxes never appeared and tanks rumbled in, bomber planes buzzed overhead and militias stormed in alongside Sudanese troops. A raft of internationally brokered deals have fallen by the wayside, analysts say. Khartoum is not keen to implement an African Union (AU) proposal to hold a referendum this month to solve the impasse in the absence of a negotiated settlement. After losing the South and 75% of its oil at secession, diplomats say that for Sudan's governing National Congress Party, keeping Abyei has become a political necessity at a time when tensions are running high following a wave of recent protests. But in bombed-out Abyei, where telephone masts twist through houses like a macabre runaway rollercoaster, and the wind whistles through abandoned buildings stripped of roofs and fittings, nothing suggests a vote is being organized. AU representatives would not comment on Abyei. Deng Alor, a former South Sudan minister now championing the unofficial referendum, says Sudan has thwarted efforts to hold the vote. Regardless, he says that the people of Abyei will have their say now or never in a vote that Sudan "has rejected five times," most recently on the grounds that the Misseriya are not adequately represented. "President Bashir is determined, no matter how long it takes him, he will not accept the referendum commission to be formed. He will not accept the referendum to be held here, so it's a waste of time." Mr Alor says that if the AU does not support a vote, the Dinka Ngok will simply declare their choice of South Sudan and then lobby for international support. "If they say the referendum cannot happen this month, the people of Abyei will hold [a] community based referendum, and that would be unilateral, and organised by the people of Abyei," he says. Zacharia Diing Akol, an analyst at South Sudanese think-tank The Sudd Institute, says that history dictates that this would only produce one result: "Violence. Remember we are talking about an area that has been attacked in the recent past by Sudan twice, in 2008 and in 2011," he says. "The attack on each occasion was coming out of the fear that they were losing, that they were no longer in control and they wanted to control the place." People on the ground agree, and are warning the uninitiated like Ms Deng about what to expect. "They have told me stories: 'Can you run? Can you do this or that? Can you stay for 4-5 days without eating?' And I've told them that I don't think I can do it." Anger over the killing of Dinka Ngok paramount chief Kuol Deng Kuol in May could boil over in the coming weeks when Misseriya are due to cross with their cattle through Abyei into South Sudan. As rumours swirl about Sudan massing men in northern Abyei and South Sudan boosting plain-clothes forces in villages further south, some fear that this year's migration could spark clashes that the 5,000 UN peacekeepers in the region would fail to extinguish. Abyei also remains a thorn in relations between the two countries and fresh fighting could derail other agreements on oil exports and contested borders that last year provoked weeks of heavy border fighting and fears of a return to all-out war. While analysts say that Sudan is loath to let Abyei's vast arable land and oil fields go, South Sudan's largest ethnic group, the Dinka, cannot bear to lose what they regard as the land of their forefathers. Sudanese officials and the Misseriya have already threatened violence if a unilateral referendum is held, while the AU and UN have warned of wider conflicts if Abyei erupts. In an Abyei camp with no water, little food and only enough tents for the children, returnee Mary Ajok is content to sleep outside and wait until she can reclaim her homeland for future generations. "We are just hoping this referendum succeeds so the children can come back," she says of her eight children and the many orphans waiting further South, whose memories of Abyei are of indelible bloodshed. "We ran for our lives, and because there was war and a lot of destruction and the killing and the burning of houses was too much. The men were dead and the widows had to take the kids away for survival. "Now we are back in the hope that there will be a referendum... We don't know what will happen but we cannot leave this land. It's ours." A steady stream of people is returning to vote with their feet if nothing else. But if there is no real agreement, they may soon have to turn on their heels and flee. </body>

      <title>The cult of the French pastry chef</title>
      <description>The rise and rise of the celebrity patissier</description>

      <body>No French high street would be complete without a patisserie, and words such as "gateau", "eclair" and "flan" indicate that French pastry chefs are esteemed as much abroad as at home. But in the last couple of years, patissiers have shot to stardom, joining the top ranks of France's celebrity chefs. French patisserie used to be delicious but predictable - the chocolate eclair, the vanilla or raspberry flavoured macaroon, the classic French apple tart or the mille-feuille (a sophisticated vanilla slice). Something has changed. Ever heard of the caramel popcorn, pistachio-orange or pecan eclair by Christophe Adam? Or the olive-oil macaroon with mandarin orange and cucumber water by Pierre Herme? These are a couple of the audacious creations a new generation of French pastry chefs have launched on a startled but delighted French public. France has always loved patisserie, but for some reason it now loves its patissiers more than ever. Their books are filling the shelves of book shops, and their stores are multiplying - five new "patisseries de luxe" opened in the month of September, in Paris alone. And while The Great British Bake Off has gone from strength to strength, France has developed its own competitive baking shows, such as this year's Who Will be the Next Great Patissier? For the last episode contestants had to make a piece of fashion out of chocolate. Another show, The Gateau of My Dreams, where a chef goes to someone's house to help them bake a challenging cake or dessert, began in February 2012 - starting with mille-feuille with caramelised maple syrup, and Black Forest gateau with acidulated morello cherry - and published a spin-off book in its first year. One explanation for the sudden rise of the pastry chef is as a consequence of the recession. In these times of crisis, patisserie has become a relatively affordable luxury - compared say with going to the restaurant - says Sebastien Gaudard, one of today's up-and-coming pastry chefs. He has noticed a change in his customers' habits. Instead of buying a big cake for a Sunday lunch or a dinner party, couples are now more likely to visit during the week to buy one or two patisseries for themselves alone. Patisserie, he says, is a form of comfort food. "What drives the world of sweets, I think, is that eating sweets brings us back to a time in our lives when we had no worries, the carefree time of childhood." But the growing enthusiasm for patisserie is also due to the fact that a new generation of pastry chefs have re-invented their craft, according to Zakari Benkhadra, managing director of the Ecole Nationale Superieure de la Patisserie (ENSP), in the countryside south of Lyon. Chefs have started to make elaborate and visually interesting creations using techniques such as mixing sweetness and saltiness (salty macaroons), creating original shapes (an audio cassette shaped pistachio-chocolate bar) or making surprising high-quality desserts using mainstream products such as Haribo sweets and Nutella. A parallel piece of culinary invention, which made headlines earlier this year, was the cronut - a cross between a croissant and a donut - created by French chef Dominique Ansel in New York. The patisserie craze has had a direct impact on the ENSP's enrolment numbers. Struggling to fill some classes in 2008, it now turns away some applicants for lack of space. But not all the top patissiers are modernising traditional recipes and improvising with new tastes. Sebastien Gaudard represents another trend, which is to return to authentic and relatively simple creations. "My wish is to render the past marvellously present," says Gaudard, 43. Gaudard, the son of a famous pastry chef in Lorraine, eastern France, is one of a number of contemporary pastry chefs who served an apprenticeship at the Paris institution, Fauchon, which is famed above all for its patisserie. Since November 2011 he has run a shop in the ninth arrondissement of Paris, selling delicacies from the past that are no longer always available in every patisserie. These include the Puits d'amour, a dessert created by the 18th Century chef Vincent La Chapelle, its hollow centre stuffed with vanilla cream, and the classic Paris-Brest, made of choux pastry and a praline-flavoured cream, inspired by the Paris-Brest-Paris cycle race - its circular shape representing a bicycle wheel. A speciality is the Mussipontain a cake made of meringue, vanilla cream and caramelised almonds whose name derives from the inhabitants of the city of Pont-à-Mousson, Gaudard's home town. This is his father's own creation. But whether people prefer startling creativity or traditional pastries, all pastry chefs are out to please their customers - and the customers evidently enjoy being pleased. "We sell pleasure," says Gaudard. "People come to us for pleasure." </body>

      <description>Are people getting too snobbish about frozen food?</description>

      <body>A new series captures what life is like at frozen food retailer Iceland, but are some of us a little bit snooty in our attitude to frozen food? Google it and you'll see there have been dozens of attempts to establish whether fresh or frozen vegetables are better for you. Many cite a US Food and Drug Administration report from 1998 that established frozen was better than fresh. Advocates of frozen say the process prevents nutrient loss occurring in transport. Even those who plump for fresh admit that frozen vegetables are still a healthy option. And yet there's a marked degree of antipathy towards frozen food. "Iceland is a classic British institution that half the country loves and half the country hates. Half of the population absolutely hate it without ever having, in most cases, been in a shop or bought a product," says Keith Hann, PR consultant for Iceland Foods. "In a word, snobbery." For some, frozen food conjures up images of Mike Leigh's 1977 drama Abigail's Party, with kitsch dishes such as defrosted prawn cocktail, vol-au-vents and black forest gateau, not forgetting the staple of any 70s dinner party - the Arctic roll. Brian Young, director general of the British Frozen Food Federation (BFFF), says he senses a chill in the air when it comes to the British public's opinion of frozen food. "Pretty much every food manufacturer will do blind testing of their product and every blind test that I've known, particularly on fish and other products, will ask the consumer to compare two samples side by side and nearly always they prefer the frozen variety. "If you then show them the packaging and you show it was a frozen product or a fresh product, they then nearly always choose the fresh one, even though they have just tasted something that was significantly better." Price could be a factor, suggests Young. "[Frozen food] can be produced much more efficiently than a fresh or a chilled counterpart, so it finishes up that the price of the product is quite often significantly less. People associate the fact that if you looked at two pizzas and one was £2.50 and one was £1.50 you naturally assume the £2.50 one is better quality." Cutting down on waste in the supply chain is one of the biggest advantages of freezing, says Young. But he also claims there are health benefits. Research conducted recently by Chester University and Leatherhead Food Research - and funded by the BFFF - found in two out of three cases frozen fruit and vegetables contained more antioxidants and nutrients than fresh produce. "They are losing their vitamins, they are losing their antioxidants the minute they come out of the ground or you pick them off the plant or tree, so by freezing them you lock in that goodness for longer," says Young. However Michael Barker, editor of Fresh Produce Journal, says consumers do like the taste and that "just picked" look of fresh produce. "It's true scientifically that you do start to lose [some] nutrients as soon as the product is picked, but I don't think it's such a massive loss that you're not still getting those nutrients. It's still an incredibly healthy product to eat regardless of whether it's fresh or frozen," says Barker. He says fresh and frozen are not rivals when it comes to the food chain. "The number of fruit and vegetables, and particularly fruit, that you find frozen is relatively limited. You think about the biggest selling fruits - bananas, oranges, apples, pears - you don't really see these in frozen formats." Jamie Oliver and Delia Smith have both used frozen vegetables in recipes on their cookery programmes. But David Gray, analyst at Planet Retail, rejects the idea that frozen food has any type of image problem. "Frozen food is a lot more popular than it used to be, a lot more common," says Gray. "It is seen as good value for money by consumers." He believes the industry's reputation was knocked recently by the horse meat scandal which affected frozen meat products, but predicts frozen food sales will keep rising. He also says frozen food could expand into discount stores. Some pound stores are already starting to sell a small selection of frozen food. There has even been a resurgence in the popularity of some retro classics such as chicken Kiev - eaten by Don Draper in the 1960s inspired TV series Mad Men. As well as expanding into new areas of the high street, frozen food manufacturers and retailers are also now offering consumers new ranges at the top end of the market. For example, frozen food store Cook sells handmade food for the freezer. Beef wellingtons are priced at £20 for two portions, and on the packet you will find the name of the chef who prepared the dish before it was frozen. Food critic and regular on BBC's Masterchef Kate Spicer says there is a "revolution in home cooked food being sold on to people". She advocates schemes such as buying homemade food from a neighbour who has more time to spare to prepare meals which can then be frozen. When it comes down to it the British public are not snobbish about the method of preservation, she says. "There's frozen food and there's frozen food, and I think a lot of it has to do with the brand on the box and not the fact that it's frozen," says Spicer.

      <description>The winners and losers of Burma's opening up</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24605695</url>
      <date>1382395048</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70603000/jpg/_70603579_55313388.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>The economy of Burma, officially called Myanmar, is open for business. That's the message the reformist government of President Thein Sein is sending out, and it has got an overwhelmingly positive response from investors. But behind the impressive headline figures of planned ventures and promised aid, who is actually doing well in the new Burma? There have been some high-profile announcements - Nissan and Suzuki want to manufacture cars, Ford has opened a dealership, Coca-Cola already has a local bottling plant. But many foreign investors are waiting both for infrastructure to improve and for greater political certainty before jumping in. The indigenous Burmese business community, on the other hand, has been a hive of activity. Inevitably, the companies best placed to profit from the new opportunities are the so-called cronies - those who built up their businesses through close co-operation with the old military regime. Despite still being listed on US sanctions lists, with their resources and experience, they are winning many of the new infrastructure contracts. Smaller companies, though, are cashing in on booming demand for property, consumer goods and services. Wai Thit Lwin, a graduate from Berkeley in her 20s, juggles looking after her two young daughters, expanding a local chain of 50 convenience stores, and helping manage a company that operates hospitals, hotels, and markets brands such as Sony and LG in Burma. Everything she is involved in is growing fast. Her main concerns? The inadequacy of Burma's banking system - local companies have to pay punishing interest rates for capital - and the threat of competition from the convenience store giant 7-11. Then there was Cho Thet Nwe, who left school to help bring up her brothers, but is now the brand manager for the French cosmetics company L'Oreal. "When we started selling European products here in 1996, it was so difficult," she recalls. "Back then the whole family would use the same soap, from head to toe. We were trying to sell facial foams and shampoo - we had to start educating them from zero. But now lifestyles have changed tremendously." One of the most conspicuous improvements in consumer choice is the availability of mobile phones. When I first reported from Burma 12 years ago only a tiny elite were allowed to buy mobiles. The phones themselves were heavy, ancient, first generation models. Today Sim cards are available, although still in limited numbers and for a much higher price than in neighbouring countries. And you can buy pretty much any model of phone, from the numerous, glaringly lit shops in Rangoon (also known as Yangon). Myat Thiri Khaing studied Chinese at university, intending to work as a translator. Instead she joined one of Burma's first phone retailers, Lu Gyi Min, excited by the possibilities of technology. Today she is the manager of the busy Latha Street branch, doing evening classes in management to improve her chances of promotion. The business is growing quickly, she told me, especially outside Rangoon, where they have plans to open more branches. But amid these positive stories, the majority of Burmese have yet to feel any material benefits from the reforms. And there are some who feel they are losing out in this new and unpredictable environment. A few kilometres from downtown Rangoon is south Dagon, designated an industrial zone back in the days of military rule. Part of it is given over to rows of small iron foundries, operating the most primitive technology. Sweat-grimed workers pull glowing strips of metal from open furnaces, and toss them expertly to others who catch them with tongs, and run them through clattering presses. I met U Mitthya, who assembles small pick-up trucks, his workers welding them by hand. In the days of military rule, when car imports were tightly restricted, it was a good business. Now as inexpensive vehicle imports flood in, it is no longer a viable business. He said the three trucks in his workshop were probably the last he would make. The big plans to expand Burma's industrial base have caused casualties too. The most ambitious project is a planned industrial estate next to the port of Thilawa, south of Rangoon, to provide an area of reliable power and suitable infrastructure for Japanese manufacturers. But this requires moving the people who have been living on the land for many years. Daw Htay Htay and a few of her neighbours say that under military rule they had been forced to give up their land for paltry compensation. But as the planned project never took off, they simply carried on cultivating it. Now the government wants to start construction of Thilawa, as early as the end of this year. It has offered the value of six years' rice harvests, and an alternative plot of land. Daw Htay Htay says she is being put under pressure by officials to accept, but feels the compensation is not enough. In this time of change, she told me: "I feel it is only we who are losing." But it is not only her. Land disputes have erupted all over the country, as new economic opportunities make previously worthless land valuable again. This is an emotional issue, with the potential to overshadow much of the good news that is coming out of Burma these days. </body>

      <title>Canine virus threatens Siberian tiger</title>
      <description>Canine distemper is latest threat to Siberian tiger</description>

      <body>The Siberian tiger: majestic, enigmatic - the classic big cat precariously balanced on the edge of extinction. Threatened by deforestation and poaching to supply the black market trade in tiger body parts, it is one of the most endangered cats on the planet. But over the past decade or so, a new threat has emerged - a silent, insidious one - canine distemper virus. Worldwide there are an estimated 400-500 Siberian or Amur tigers. Exact numbers are hard to determine because this is a reclusive animal that is rarely observed. Yet, at the turn of the century, some of these otherwise withdrawn animals were seen wandering onto roads and into villages in the Russian Far East. They were fearless and docile, confused and dazed; the antithesis of their usual ferocious and wary demeanour. Over the next few years evidence mounted that this, the largest living felid, was suffering from an infectious agent and the indications - the nature of the illness, historical understanding of wild cat infections and the diagnosis, in a single wild tiger, of a virus belonging to the morbillivirus genus - provided a likely culprit. A study published in the journal mBio, confirmed these suspicions. Genetic analysis of several dead tiger samples showed that canine distemper virus was the cause. Canine distemper virus (CDV), a relative of the human measles virus, was first described in dogs and infection causes fatal pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). But this virus is incredibly promiscuous and can infect jump into a variety of different animals - usually with catastrophic effects. Two suspected CDV outbreaks, the first in 1988 and a second in 2000, killed thousands of Baikal then Caspian seals. The virus has also ripped through Africa, with fatal outbreaks in silver-backed jackals and bat-eared foxes and catastrophic die-offs in wild dog populations that continue to this day. For years, cats were thought resistant to CDV. Yes, domestic cats could be infected in the laboratory, but this was inefficient and the virus was unable to pass from one animal to another. A massive demise in 1994 of African lions living in the Serengeti national park in Tanzania showed that this was fallacy. This population of closely monitored lions succumbed to CDV. Whilst only 34 lion deaths were documented during the outbreak, this was only the tip of the iceberg. Before CDV struck, the lion population numbered 3,000, but afterwards this had fallen by a third. In the same outbreak, countless hyenas, bat-eared foxes and leopards also perished. Add to this the recent report of infection of large numbers of South American jaguar and it is evident that this virus has little, if any respect for the so-called species barrier - the unique inherent host factors and properties that prevent viruses from jumping from one species to another. In an intriguing turn of events, CDV was also starting to spark fatal outbreaks in various primates. So what should we make of the emergence of CDV infection in primates. Is this an indication of the potential for a more compelling species jump? Could CDV do the unthinkable and infect humans? The simple answer is a resounding yes. At least, in theory it is. To replicate, a virus has to get into a host cell. It does this through interactions between proteins on its surface with proteins - receptors - on the surface of the cell. These receptors act as gateways into the cell and if the virus protein fits then infection takes place. Different animals possess slightly different versions of these receptors on their cells so the virus proteins also have to change to be able to unlock them. A single mutation in one of surface proteins in CDV present in primates is all it takes for the virus to successfully use the human receptor. This is a tiny species barrier. But before banishing the pet dog to a high containment kennel then donning personal protective clothing before you go near, there's a key part of the story we need to consider - one that's probably been protecting us for all of these years. When you're exposed to a virus your body recognises it as foreign and your blood cells generate antibodies which bind to the virus surface proteins and protect us from infection. It's the basis for vaccination. Fortunately, the surface protein of the measles virus is so similar to CDV that antibodies generated by the measles vaccine also protect against CD; and other morbilliviruses too. But, if we ever eradicate measles and stop vaccination, maybe then we will be susceptible to CDV. But what of the Amur tiger - will CDV ensure its ultimate demise? As Dr Denise McAloose, lead author on the mBio paper, explained: "When you're talking about four to five hundred animals and your losing reproductive females and their offspring, the overall impact on populations is huge. "Some of the earlier modelling work, if it were to pan out, does suggest that this is a significant disease even at the levels of disease we are detecting now, which is probably just the tip of the iceberg." A bleak outlook that is shared by a University of Nottingham colleague, veterinary virologist Dr Rachael Tarlinton: "Because they are such tiny populations even relatively small mortality events can seriously harm their genetic diversity and this might just be enough to push them over the edge." Hopefully it's not too late. We know that CDV vaccines work and a targeted vaccination programme might just pull Amur tigers back from the brink. Current CDV vaccines have to be injected - no trivial task when the animal you want to protect is so difficult to track down and so dangerous to handle. But not all vaccines need to be injected - some very effective vaccines have been developed for oral delivery and these have been pivotal in our fight against rabies. In the late 1970s, Switzerland pioneered the widespread deployment of enticing baits laced with rabies vaccine that would be eaten by rabies-susceptible wild animals, thereby protecting them. So successful was this approach that following a similar campaign that spanned more than two decades, Germany was declared rabies-free. Whilst development of an oral vaccine is scientifically feasible, it is unlikely ever to become a reality. As Dr Tarlinton explains: "It was worth developing the oral bait vaccines for rabies because of the human zoonosis risk, but something for a purely veterinary disorder, particularly one that infects wildlife rather than livestock? It's difficult to justify the economics of doing it, even if we should." Even though vaccinating tigers is unfeasible there is an alternative: identify the reservoir and remove the virus at source through vaccination campaigns. This has proven very effective in protecting CDV-threatened lion populations in Africa. But do we know what the reservoir is? Domestic dogs have been implicated in all epidemics involving wildlife but, because the virus can infect other animals, you have to be sure. And this is what Dr McAloose and her colleagues have turned their attention to. "We have to understand if there's a reservoir. "We're trying to identify how the virus is cycling through the system to understand what the carriers are, and only with these results would we be able to make the appropriate recommendations." For the sake of the Amur tigers, I wish them well in their quest. </body>

      <title>Exoplanet tally soars above 1,000</title>
      <description>The number of observed exoplanets - those orbiting distant stars - passes 1,000 and of these, 12 might be habitable, scientists claim.</description>

      <body>The number of observed exoplanets - worlds circling distant stars - has passed 1,000. Of these, 12 could be habitable - orbiting at a distance where it is neither "too hot" nor "too cold" for water to be liquid on the surface. The planets are given away by tiny dips in light as they pass in front of their stars or through gravitational "tugs" on the star from an orbiting world. These new worlds are listed in the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia. The tally now stands at 1,010 new exoplanets, bolstered by 11 new finds from the UK's Wide Angle Search for Planets (Wasp). Abel Mendez of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico, said that although the number has rapidly increased in recent years, due to a lack of funding this figure is much lower than it could be. "We have more techniques and proven technology to detect more exoplanets, but the limit has been telescopes, especially space telescopes. "If we had more funding there would be more telescopes and that count would be much larger by now." The Kepler space telescope, which spotted many of these worlds in recent years, broke down earlier this year. Scientists still have to trawl through more than 3,500 other candidates from this mission so the number could rapidly increase. In January 2013, astronomers used Kepler's data to estimate that there could be at least 17 billion Earth-sized exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy. They said that one in six stars could host an Earth-sized planet in close orbit. The number of confirmed planets frequently increases because as scientists analyse the data they are able publish their results online immediately. But as the finds are not yet peer reviewed, the total figure remains subject to change. "Each night we get a list of astronomy papers where there might be an exoplanet announcement. When we get that we have to review it," explained Prof Mendez. This exoplanet catalogue is organised by Jean Schneider, an astronomer at the Paris Observatory. For the past 18 years he has catalogued new exoplanets on the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia. Others in the field, like Prof Mendez, are then able to review and comment on the findings, which makes it "more dynamic" he explained. "That's why the other catalogues just lag behind. The review is reliable as it's exactly the same as what the journals do." Prof Mendez told BBC News. Nasa will only accept those announced in an academic journal, so it updates its list far less frequently. Their tally currently stands at 919 confirmed worlds. Jean Schneider said it was also important to note that there was "no consensus for the definition of a planet" and that past experience had shown that a few objects declared as planets were actually artefacts or low-mass stars. "Some objects, like some Kepler planets, are declared 'confirmed planets' but have not been published in [referenced] articles. It does not mean that they will not be published later on, but it introduces another fuzziness in the tally," he added. Even if there was a generally adopted definition, Mr Schneider said that for some objects "there is a large uncertainty on parameters, so that the planetary nature of the object is uncertain". For Prof Mendez reaching 1,000 marks an important milestone in the quest to understand the history of the evolution of the cosmos. "I don't just want to know where the exoplanets are, I want to understand the stars, because they are the hosts for the planets. I want to understand the whole galaxy and the distribution of the stars because everything is connected," he explained. For him, the most exciting discoveries are Earth-like planets which could be habitable. "We want to know how unique our planet is, that's a big question and we are now closer than ever," he added. For Mr Schneider the most interesting is the candidate exoplanet around Alpha Centauri, as it is circling a star only four light-years away. This planet likely has the same mass as Earth but is outside the "habitable zone" as it circles its star far closer than Mercury orbits our Sun. </body>

      <body>A meteorite reveals clues to how Mars lost its thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere and became a cold, rocky desert, researchers say. They say the Lafayette meteorite shows signs of carbonation - where minerals absorb CO2 in a reaction with water. Mars lost its protective blanket about 4 billion years ago, perhaps because of the loss of its magnetic field, space impacts, or chemical processes. Carbonation may be the key factor, they write in Nature Communications. The process occurs naturally on Earth - and has been proposed as a technique for mitigating climate change, by capturing CO2 from the atmosphere. The 4.5cm Lafayette meteorite was discovered in Indiana, US in 1931, having plummeted to Earth about 3,000 years ago. It formed in the Red Planet's crust about 1.3 billion years ago, and was ejected from the surface by a massive impact. A team from the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC) performed microscopic analysis on a section of the rock - borrowed from the Natural History Museum in London. They found that silicate minerals, such as olivine and feldspar, had interacted with CO2-rich liquid water to form siderite crystals. The team says their discovery suggests liquid water was present on Mars more recently than some had thought. They also say it represents the first direct evidence for carbonation on the Red Planet - and ties in with the discovery of carbonates by Nasa's Curiosity Mars rover. "Carbonation could be the main force that turned Mars to stone," said lead author Dr Tim Tomkinson, of SUERC. "We can't say for certain it's the dominant cause - the loss of Mars' magnetic field may also have led to the stripping of its atmosphere by the solar wind. And CO2 is also frozen in the poles of Mars. "But carbonates do seem to be very abundant on the Martian surface." The loss of its carbon dioxide cloak is likely to have caused Mars to cool. So understanding how the CO2 was removed "could provide vital clues to how we can limit the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere and so reduce climate change" said Dr Tomkinson. Mineral carbonation is widespread on Earth. For example, in Oman's Samail mountains, weathering of peridotite rocks has been estimated to bind more than 10,000 tons of CO2 per year. Speeding up this natural process - by fracking rocks and pumping in purified CO2 - has been proposed as a technique for carbon capture and storage. "From our analysis of the meteorite, it seems that carbonation occurs in certain orientations - we see amazing saw-tooth edges, all lining up," Dr Tomkinson told BBC News. "It could be for example that if you wanted to frack rocks and introduce CO2 you should do it from a certain angle." Dr Caroline Smith, curator of meteorites at the Natural History Museum, said: "These findings show just how valuable meteorites from collections like those we have here really are. "There is so much important and useful scientific information locked away in these rare rocks. "Our study shows that as we learn more about our planetary next door neighbour, we are seeing more and more similarities with geological processes on Earth." </body>

      <body>Experts have found the first venomous crustacean - a centipede-like creature that lives in underwater caves. The blind "remipede" liquefies its prey with a compound similar to that found in a rattlesnake's fangs. It lives in underwater caves of the Caribbean, Canary Islands and Western Australia, feeding on other crustaceans. The venom contains a complex cocktail of toxins, including enzymes and a paralysing agent. The findings are detailed in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution. The remipede (Speleonectes tulumensis) breaks down body tissues with its venom and then sucks out a liquid meal from its prey's exoskeleton. Co-author Dr Ronald Jenner, a zoologist at London's Natural History Museum said: "The unique insights from this study really help improve our understanding of the evolution of animal venoms. "The spider-like feeding technique of the remipede is unique among crustaceans. This venom is clearly a great adaptation for these blind cave-dwellers that live in nutrient-poor underwater caves." Crustaceans are a large group of the wider category of animals known as arthropods. They include shrimp, krill, lobsters and crabs. Most are aquatic, but a few - such as woodlice - live on land. Dr Bjoern von Reumont, also from the Natural History Museum commented: "This is the first time we have seen venom being used in crustaceans and the study adds a new major animal group to the roster of known venomous animals. "Venoms are especially common in three of the four major groups of arthropods, such as insects. Crustaceans, however, are a glaring exception to the rule. "While they can be as varied as tiny waterfleas, krill, crabs and barnacles, not one of the approximately 70,000 described species of crustaceans was known, until now, to be venomous." </body>

      <title>UN climate chief's tears over future</title>
      <description>A passionate concern over the world that children will inherit sees the head of the UN's climate body break down in tears.</description>

      <body>The head of the UN body tasked with delivering a global climate treaty broke down in tears at a meeting in London as she spoke about the impact of global warming on coming generations. Christiana Figueres told the BBC that the lack of an agreement was "condemning future generations before they are even born". Ms Figueres said this was "completely unfair and immoral". Despite the slow pace of negotiations, she said a deal can be done by 2015. Costa Rica-born Christiana Figueres has been the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for the last three years. Taking over after the failure of the talks process in Copenhagen in 2009, Ms Figueres has carefully steered the parties forward. Delegates agreed in Durban in 2011 that a new global deal must be signed by 2015 and come into force from 2020. But Ms Figueres' passionate approach to progress has been tested by the slow, tortuous UN process, where consensus is the only way forward. "I am always frustrated by the pace of the negotiations, I was born impatient. We are moving way, way too slowly, but we are moving in the right direction and that's what gives me courage and hope," she said. Speaking to the BBC on the sidelines of a climate conference at Chatham House in London, Ms Figueres became tearful when she reflected on the impact that climate change might have on coming generations. "I'm committed to climate change because of future generations, it is not about us, right? We're out of here," she said. "I just feel that it is so completely unfair and immoral what we are doing to future generations, we are condemning them before they are even born." "We have a choice about it, that's the point, we have a choice. If it were inevitable then so be it, but we have a choice to change the future we are going to give our children." She said that she was hopeful an agreement could be signed in Paris in 2015 but if that was going to happen, then significant progress had to be made in the next 12 months. There would need to be the draft text of an agreement when the parties meet in Peru in 2014. She said she was determined to avoid the mistakes that were made in the run up to Copenhagen in 2009, when expectations of a far reaching global compact faltered. "We are not going to have another Copenhagen - the leaders of the world are not just being brought in at the last minute, to face 300 pages of text that is completely impossible to digest. Next year would see a special climate summit of world leaders called by UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon. Ms Figueres is hopeful that this will clear the road ahead of the Paris meeting in 2015. "It is not going to be in Paris, going into all the technical details of how to build the agreement which is what we had in Copenhagen. The structure and logic of an agreement need to be in place. "This is way too complex and way too challenging to wait until the last minute in 2015." This year's Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC will take place next month in Poland. Some environmental campaigners are concerned that because of the country's heavy dependence on coal, it is less committed to strong action on climate change. Critics took issue with comments on an official website for the conference that suggested there were many positives to the unprecedented melting of Arctic ice, including the opportunity to chase "pirates, terrorists and ecologists". But Ms Figueres dismissed concerns about the meeting. "They have shown themselves to be very committed to this process, the COP president (Polish environment minister Marcin Korolec) has put in an extraordinary amount of time into learning and making himself familiar with the endless intricacies of this issue," she said.

      <title>Badger group disruption aids TB flow</title>
      <description>Badgers with TB spread the infection more easily to other badgers and to cattle when social groups are disturbed, a new study confirms.</description>

      <body>Badgers with TB spread the infection more easily to other badgers and to cattle when social groups are disturbed, a new study confirms. Vaccination has the potential to reduce the spread of infection without disturbing local populations, scientists report in Current Biology. The findings help explain why culling badgers can cause TB infection in cattle to rise, as infected badgers roam into new territory, they say. Pilot culls are underway in England. Badgers are being culled in west Somerset; with a decision due shortly on whether to extend a pilot cull in west Gloucestershire. In the study, researchers at the University of Exeter and the National Wildlife Management Centre at Woodchester Park, Gloucestershire, fitted 51 badgers in eight different social groups with electronic collars. They monitored the range of the wild badgers and their social interactions over the course of a year. The researchers were able to build a detailed picture of the social network of a wild population of badgers for the first time. We think of badgers as living in tight knit social groups and "sleeping in a big heap underground", but there is more complexity to it, said Prof Robbie McDonald of the University of Exeter, who led the study. "What our study shows is that social structure is very important for the transmission of infection in wild badgers," he told BBC News. "It also suggests that social stability is a good way of mitigating disease spread. So if you can intervene in a system and maintain social stability that's likely to be the best of both worlds." Vaccination does not disrupt social structure, he said, suggesting the social network in badgers - where relatively few individuals might be responsible for disease spread - lends itself to vaccination and could lead quite rapidly to herd immunity. "If you are trying to control disease, it may be advantageous not to disrupt social structure and so you could disrupt flow through those sorts of individuals by using vaccination," Prof McDonald added. "But of course vaccination doesn't do any good to an animal that's already infected." A 9-year trial found that culling badgers could reduce infection in cattle by 12-16% (after four years of culling and five years of follow-up). But if too few badgers are killed over too long a time period, TB infections in cattle can rise as badgers roam further afield to establish new social groups. Prof Rosie Woodroffe of the Institute of Zoology, London, said the study provided clarity about how badgers' social behaviour helps to constrain the spread of TB. "Genetic studies in the Randomised Badger Culling Trial found that culling increased badgers' movements, with especially marked increases for infected badgers," she said. "This new study helps to understand how such behavioural changes could prompt the major increases in disease prevalence which we saw as a result of culling. "The authors are right to highlight that their work shows how the benefits of badger vaccination are likely to be enhanced by badgers' social behaviour, because badger social networks are small and local, so vaccinating small numbers of badgers could still have benefits at a local scale. In contrast, culling disrupts badger social behaviour and spreads disease across the landscape." The Welsh government has chosen to vaccinate badgers in an effort to control TB in cattle, while the government policy in England is to cull badgers in high TB areas. Around 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in 2012 at a cost of £100m to taxpayers. Ministers and the NFU say culling is needed to fight bovine TB, but animal welfare and wildlife groups say scientific evidence does not support the policy of shooting badgers in an attempt to control the disease. </body>

      <title>Dung beetle has galloping gait</title>
      <description>Three species of desert dung beetle move with a newly discovered "galloping gait", rather than walking like other insects, scientists say.</description>

      <body>Scientists have discovered that three species of dung beetle walk with a "galloping" gait not seen in any other insect. The vast majority of insect species walk with what is known as an alternating tripod gait - steadily moving forward three legs at a time. It is not clear why these flightless beetles have shifted so radically from the usual way of walking. The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology. The researchers wrote: "Like a bounding hare, the beetles propel their body forward by synchronously stepping with both middle legs and then both front legs." The beetles appeared simply to "drag" their back legs, they added. Dr Jochen Smolka, from the University of Lund in Sweden, who carried out the research in South Africa, was studying wingless desert dung beetles in order to find out how they navigated to their burrows. "We noticed that [one species we were looking at] was kind of bobbing along in a peculiar manner," he told BBC News. "At first we thought that maybe there was something wrong with it - that maybe it had some damage to its hind legs. "And then we noticed that all of the beetles of that species move like that most of the time." The researchers used high-speed camera to film the beetles' motion in detail. They then carried out tests in the lab, tracing the exact movement of the insects' legs as they walked across sandpaper. If the group of species the team was studying, known as Pachysoma, they found three species to have this same unusual gait. Dr Bill Sellers, who studies biomechanics at the University of Manchester, described the findings as "very peculiar". He explained that almost all of about one million insect species that have been described to science walk with the classic tripod gait. "They form a triangle with their legs," he explained. "So they have the left-front, right-middle and left-back legs on down at once, and then the opposite ones." "It's a very easy gait to control, and we know it's quite efficient." "So it's difficult to see why these beetles do what they do - it's a real puzzle." Dr Smolka and his colleagues carried out miniature time trials in their lab to see if this beetle was able to move any faster than beetles that walked normally. "But it turned out that the normally walking insects were up to 50% faster," he said. "What we're going to look at in the future is if it has something to do with their navigation." Their latest studies have suggested that the galloping beetles are able to stabilise their vision better when they are on slippery surfaces. "So it could be that if you're moving really fast [in a tripod gait], your head just moves from side to side so much that vision could be blurred," Dr Smolka explained. "Whereas in the galloping beetles, vision is always stabilised towards the front." </body>

      <title>UK set to guarantee energy projects</title>
      <description>A string of renewable energy projects are earmarked for possible government backing in an effort to speed up infrastructure schemes.</description>

      <body>A string of renewable energy projects have been earmarked for possible government backing. The private schemes, including a Forth Estuary wind farm and a biomass plant in Bristol are in line for up to £33bn in government guarantees. The Treasury has agreed to step in and underwrite part of the building costs if they cannot get funding elsewhere. Ministers said it would boost growth and jobs, but Labour said their record on infrastructure was "appalling". The Treasury has announced details of 13 energy, transport and education schemes that could get government backing if they do not attract financial backing by other means. The £40bn UK Guarantee Scheme, launched by Chancellor George Osborne last year, is part of ministers' efforts to encourage private sector investment and to boost spending seen as vital to the economy's long-term development. The new projects eligible for potential support are: Should the projects fail to attract commercial funding, the government has agreed to step in to underwrite part or all of the capital spending - charging the contractors a fee for doing so. The government has previously announced that it is prepared to guarantee the proposed £16bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, due to be built by French firm EDF, with support from Chinese investors. The extension of the Northern Line Tube network in London and the Mersey Gateway bridge have also been offered guarantees, in principle, as have 24 other projects whose details have not been released for commercial reasons. Guarantees are not awarded until detailed feasibility and due diligence studies have been completed and contractors are ready to approach financial markets for funding. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the government was the first ever to use the strength of its balance sheet to facilitate infrastructure projects. He defended the number of projects that had been backed so far, saying the mere offer of a guarantee had helped some projects to get alternative sources of funding. "The offer of a guarantee is helping to get projects going," he told the BBC News Channel. "There is a lot of infrastructure happening in this country because of this programme." In 2010, the government pledged to spend £200bn on major infrastructure projects by 2015, with an emphasis on delivering key projects on time and on budget. It has also announced additional spending after 2015. The Institute of Civil Engineers welcomed Tuesday's announcement and said the guarantee scheme had enabled "viable projects to secure finance in difficult market conditions". "It is an excellent example of government making creative use of its resources to get projects moving," said the organisation's director general Nick Baveystock. But Labour said the government had wasted the past three years. The opposition said only one project - the £700m partial conversion of the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire from coal to biomass - had actually taken advantage of the UK Guarantee scheme to date while, in total, work had only begun on one in five of infrastructure projects. "There's lots more that could be done but they just don't seem to have their heart in it," said shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie. "The energy isn't there and there's a question of competence now about whether they can deliver on some of these infrastructure promises that they're making." Labour has called for an independent commission to be set up to end what it says are "decades of drift and delay" on major infrastructure decisions. Business groups have also warned about the slow pace of infrastructure spending, saying it holds the key to a sustainable long-term recovery. "Despite the scale of the UK Guarantee Scheme, only around a third of firms are aware of it, so this announcement will help raise awareness to other projects struggling to find finance," said the CBI's Rhian Kelly. "The government now needs to push more of these pre-qualification projects through the approval stage so that they can get off the drawing board." </body>

      <title>Worldwide ban on bird pollutant</title>
      <description>A pollutant that killed thousands of birds off the coast of Britain earlier this year can no longer be dumped at sea after a worldwide ban was agreed.</description>

      <body>A pollutant that killed thousands of birds off the coast of Britain earlier this year will no longer be dumped at sea after a worldwide ban was agreed. More than 4,000 birds were killed or injured by the chemical polyisobutene (PIB) between Cornwall and Sussex, and on the Channel Islands. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has reclassified PIBs from 2014. It means ships will only be able to wash their tanks and dispose of all PIB residues while in port. Until now it has been legal for discharges to be made when vessels wash out their tanks, as long as they are further than 12 nautical miles from the nearest point of land. The ban had been recommended by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), on behalf of the government, and was welcomed by the RSPB, RSPCA and other wildlife charities. The decision was taken by the IMO at a meeting in London on Monday. "There was only one entry for PIBs before," said the IMO's Natasha Brown. "We are keeping the current category but will create a new entry for the high viscosity PIB, which is the problem chemical if you like, in terms of these discharges." The substance - a lubricant used to improve the engine performance of ships - was found on seabirds, mainly guillemots, in two separate instances between January and May. In the sea, high viscosity PIB becomes "glue-like", covering birds and restricting their movements and ability to feed, causing them to eventually die from hypothermia or starvation. In August, the MCA said it had been unable to trace the vessel the contamination spill had come from and closed its investigation. Adam Grogan, RSPCA senior wildlife scientist, said: "Our staff worked around the clock washing and treating these poor birds in January and April and it was heartbreaking seeing the pitiful state they were in. "Hopefully this will help stop incidents like these happening again, and save wildlife from suffering and dying like this in the future." Alec Taylor, from RSPB, said wildlife charities worked hard for the ban, with support from several south coast MPs. "But the huge support we received from members of the public, many of whom experienced the effects of this pollution first hand as they walked the beaches, was perhaps the clinching factor in achieving such a quick decision to prevent discharges of harmful PIBs," he added. The IMO is the United Nations agency responsible for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships. It consists of 170 member states, of which the UK is one. The organisation confirmed a number of other European countries had also been investigating the discharge of "high viscosity products" by chemical tankers, including PIBs. </body>

      <title>Baldness cure a 'step closer'</title>
      <description>Scientists have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory.</description>

      <body>Scientists say they have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory. A joint UK and US team was able to create new hairs from tissue samples. Far more research is needed, but the group said its technique had the "potential to transform" the treatment of hair loss. The study results were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. There are baldness therapies including drugs to slow the loss of hairs, and transplants, which move hair from the back of the head to cover bald spots. The scientists at the University of Durham, in the UK, and Columbia University Medical Centre, in the US, were trying to actually grow new hairs. Their plan was to start with material taken from the base of a hair and use it to grow many new hairs. But human hair has been tricky to grow despite successes in animal studies. Whenever human tissue was taken from the dermal papillae, the cells which form the base of each hair follicle, the cells would transform into skin instead of growing new hairs. However, the group found that by clumping the cells together in "3D spheroids" they would keep their hairy identity. Tissue was taken from seven people and grown in 3D spheroids. These were then transplanted into human skin which had been grafted on to the backs of mice. After six weeks, new hair follicles formed in five out of the seven cases and some new tiny hairs began to form. Prof Colin Jahoda, from Durham University, told the BBC a cure for baldness was possible but it was too soon for men to be hanging up the toupee. "It's closer, but it's still some way away because in terms of what people want cosmetically they're looking for re-growth of hair that's the same shape, the same size, as long as before, the same angle. Some of these are almost engineering solutions. "Yeah I think it [baldness] will eventually be treatable, absolutely." He added: "It's hard to say exactly how long that would take, but the fact that we've done it now should reawaken interest." Any future therapy would involve transplanting cells which have been grown in the laboratory so safety is a concern. There would be a risk of infection and the cells could become abnormal, or even cancerous, while being grown. Baldness cures may not be the first application of the research. Prof Jahoda believes the findings will be used to improve the quality of skin grafts used after severe burns. Prof Angela Christiano, from Columbia University, said: "This approach has the potential to transform the medical treatment of hair loss. "Current hair-loss medications tend to slow the loss of hair follicles or potentially stimulate the growth of existing hairs, but they do not create new hair follicles. "Our method, in contrast, has the potential to actually grow new follicles using a patient's own cells." </body>

      <title>British forests under threat</title>
      <description>New global threats from pests and diseases could spell disaster for British forests, experts warn.</description>

      <body>A year after the first case of ash dieback in wild trees in Britain, the disease has now spread across much of England, Wales and Scotland. The public is being asked to be the "eyes and ears" of the countryside amid concern about new global threats that could spell disaster for forests. In a London park, forester Simon Levey is checking a moth trap strung high in the canopy of an oak tree. He is searching for signs of the oak processionary moth, which is present in parts of the capital and Berkshire. When the moth's caterpillars emerge from their nests, they can strip oak trees bare and harm human health. "What we're looking for in these oak trees we see around us is their nests," says Mr Levey. "They're like a grey wart on the side of a tree that can range from the size of a golf ball, if not smaller, to things that are almost a couple of foot in size." It is the moth's caterpillars - with their thousands of tiny hairs - that are the hazard. Touching the caterpillars or their nests can cause skin rashes or, in extreme cases, sore throats, breathing difficulties and eye problems. In Croydon, inspections are being carried out for the moth around a 2km zone as part of a rigorous programme of control and monitoring. Infected areas are sprayed with a bacteriological agent to destroy nests and caterpillars. The traps - which contain a sex hormone that attracts male moths - are set outside from July to September, when adult moths are in flight, to see how far they have spread. "We've actually created a ring of traps for these moths round the infected area just to see if the moths are flying beyond where we would expect them to be," says Mr Levey. Dr Nigel Straw from the Centre for Forestry and Climate Change at the Forestry Commission says monitoring is key to organising a control programme - including surveys from the ground and pheromone trapping. Any moths captured are sent to the Forestry Commission's research station in Hampshire for analysis. "We will look at how many moths have been caught and at which locations and this will tell us where we are likely to have trees with eggs which will lead to infestations next year," says Dr Straw. Officials hope the outbreak in Croydon can be contained. But they accept the battle is lost in west and south-west London - where the moth is here to stay. Britain should expect "many hundreds" more pests and pathogens to arrive in the coming years, say scientists at Exeter University. The rise in global trade means pests that damage crops such as fungi, beetle and moths are now moving into new territories faster than other wildlife, aided by climate change, they report in the journal Nature Climate Change. Hundreds of pests and pathogens have shifted their ranges towards the poles by an average of about 3km a year since 1960. Insects are moving even faster, expanding their range by tens of kilometres a year, says Dr Daniel Bebber. "We know things are spreading and part of that spread is due to climate change. It's just one more impact that climate change is having on us. Things are being introduced all the time to different places. Climate change can help things to establish." In Croydon, Simon Levey is concerned about a decline if not a "potentially catastrophic loss" of some of Britain's dominant tree species, including the oak. He says acute oak decline is present in the area, but it is difficult to identify. "There's huge pressure on resources in terms of actually getting out there and identifying them," he says, "I suspect that if things progress as they do, we might face a real problem with our oak trees - a significant change in our landscape similar to the landscape changes when Dutch elm disease had its heyday in the '70s." With only limited government resources to monitor for new pests, some of that job may fall to the public. This is not unprecedented. In the past, the citrus longhorn beetle, which can arrive on deliveries from Asia of tree and shrub plants, and goods in wooden crates and packaging, has been spotted by vigilant members of the public. In July, Martin Ward, the UK government's chief plant health officer, asked for help from the public to spot Asian longhorn and citrus longhorn beetles. "Government plant health services cannot do this work alone, and we need the public to act as our eyes and ears in gardens, parks, woodlands and workplaces to help us spot threats quickly before they become a serious problem," he said. "The public can really help us at this time of year by looking out for these two potentially serious beetle pests. They thrive in climates similar to ours, and their establishment could result in losses of trees from a wide range of species." The Woodland Trust is currently training volunteers to look out for signs of tree diseases, while a citizen science project, known as Opal (Open Air Laboratories), is harnessing people-power to build a national picture of tree health. In the long term, however, there are big questions about the future shape and role of Britain's treescape. "What protects trees in the long term is diversity both in species and genetics," says Dr Bebber. "We don't have a very diverse tree flora - both in genetics and species diversity. We lost our elms in large because they were so genetically uniform. "We can learn from the science of ecology and evolution and look at the natural world and see that diversity is the protection. We certainly don't want to see the oak disappearing, the ash disappearing - it would be a sadder Britain." </body>

      <body>The US space agency has said it will allow Chinese scientists to attend an astronomy conference in California next month, reversing an earlier ban. Nasa put the earlier ban down to a misinterpretation of its policy on foreign nationals. Chinese officials had called the rejection of Chinese scientists' applications a form of discrimination. The event for scientists who research planets beyond the solar system will be held at Ames Research Center. The bar on Chinese scientists, revealed earlier this month, was prompted by new counter-espionage legislation restricting foreign nationals' access to Nasa facilities, Nasa spokesman Allard Beutel told the BBC. The conference will be attended by US and international researchers who work on Nasa's Kepler space telescope programme. The agency faced criticism from Chinese officials and US scientists who claimed Chinese students and researchers in their labs were being subjected to discrimination. In recent weeks, a growing number of US scientists decided to boycott the meeting in protest, with senior researchers withdrawing individually or pulling out their entire research groups. "The initial decision was based on a misinterpretation of the agency's policy regarding foreign nationals," Mr Beutel said. "We were able to clarify that interpretation and correct the decision, but it didn't happen until the federal government reopened last Thursday." Earlier this month the US government partially shut down operations for 16 days, putting hundreds of thousands of federal employees on leave. The counter-espionage legislation passed in March was part of a broad and aggressive move initiated by Congressman Frank Wolf, Republican chairman of the House of Representatives subcommittee that has jurisdiction over Nasa's budget. Mr Wolf later called Nasa's reading of the legislation "inaccurate" and sought to clarify the original intent of the law. "The congressional provision - which has been in place since early 2011 - primarily restricts bilateral, not multilateral, meetings and activities with the Communist Chinese government or Chinese-owned companies," Mr Wolf wrote in an 8 October letter to Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden. "It places no restrictions on activities involving individual Chinese nationals unless those nationals are acting as official representatives of the Chinese government," he wrote. </body>

      <title>Cheney: Heart implant hack credible</title>
      <description>Dick Cheney, the former US vice-president, reveals that he had his wireless heart implant modified for fear of terrorist attack back in 2007.</description>

      <body>Dick Cheney, the former US vice-president, has revealed that he had his heart implant modified for fear of terrorist attack. Mr Cheney's doctor disabled the heart defibrillator's wireless function in 2007 to prevent would-be assassins from interfering with it and causing a fatal heart attack. A similar scenario featured in an episode of the hit TV series Homeland. "I found it credible," Mr Cheney told CBS TV's 60 Minutes programme. "I know from the experience we had, and the necessity for adjusting my own device, that it was an accurate portrayal of what was possible,'' said Mr Cheney, who was President George W Bush's right-hand man during the "war on terror". "Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) can be vulnerable to a range of electronic signals," said Adrian Culley, global technical consultant for security company Damballa. "Research has been undertaken which shows it is entirely feasible to potentially exploit someone's ICD, given close proximity to the individual." But he said the chance of a successful attack on Mr Cheney would have been "slim". An ICD monitors heartbeat and if it detects an irregular rhythm, sends low-energy electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. In 2008, researchers from the University of Washington, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Harvard Medical School, claimed that they could carry out software radio-based attacks on ICDs that could "compromise patient safety and patient privacy". More recent research has also highlighted the security and data privacy weaknesses of some implantable medical devices. "Since the experiments in 2008, experts have acknowledged that greater security of these devices is required, and encryption has been introduced to prevent the loss of personal data," a spokesman for the Institute of Risk Management told the BBC. "As with all electronic devices, the possibility of targeted hacking still exists given the right physical situation, expert knowledge of the device and the necessary equipment. "However, it is much more likely that a strong electromagnetic field will cause the device to malfunction," he said. The American Heart Association warns ICD users against too much close-range exposure to a number of electronic devices, from mobile phones to metal detectors, retail security systems to powerful CB radios. But it points out that, in most cases, the risks are small. Cardiologist Jonathan Reiner has co-written a book with Mr Cheney called, Heart: An American Medical Odyssey, chronicling the former vice-president's many heart problems. Mr Reiner told 60 Minutes that on 11 September 2001, the day of the al-Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington, the potassium in Mr Cheney's blood rose to levels that could have caused abnormal heart rhythms and cardiac arrest - a condition called hyperkalemia. Mr Reiner feared the vice-president was going to die that night. Mr Cheney, 72, has a long history of heart troubles culminating in a heart transplant last year. </body>

      <title>Nuclear power plant gets go-ahead</title>
      <description>The government has signed a deal for the construction of Hinkley Point C, the UK's first nuclear station in a generation.</description>

      <body>The government has given the go-ahead for the UK's first new nuclear station in a generation. France's EDF Energy will lead a consortium, which includes Chinese investors, to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Ministers say the deal will help take the UK towards low-carbon power and lower generating costs in future. Critics warn guaranteeing the group a price for electricity at twice the current level will raise bills. "For the first time, a nuclear station in this country will not have been built with money from the British taxpayer," said Secretary of State for Energy Edward Davey. The two reactors planned for Hinkley, which will provide power for about 60 years, are a key part of the coalition's drive to shift the UK away from fossil fuels towards low-carbon power. Ministers and EDF have been in talks for more than a year about the minimum price the company will be paid for electricity produced at the site, which the government estimates will cost £16bn to build. The two sides have now agreed the "strike price" of £92.50 for every megawatt hour of energy Hinkley C generates. This is almost twice the current wholesale cost of electricity. This will fall to £89.50 for every megawatt hour of energy if EDF Group goes ahead with plans to develop a new nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk. Doing both would allow EDF to share costs across both projects. Mr Davey said the deal was "competitive" with other large-scale clean energy and gas projects. "While consumers won't pay anything up front, they'll share directly in any gains made from the project coming in under budget," he added. John Cridland, director-general of business lobby group the CBI, welcomed what he said was a "landmark deal". "It's important to remember this investment will help mitigate the impact of increasing costs. The fact is whatever we do, energy prices are going to have to go up to replace ageing infrastructure and meet climate change targets - unless we build new nuclear as part of a diverse energy mix." However, Dr Paul Dorfman, from the Energy Institute at University College London, said "what it equates to actually is a subsidy and the coalition said they would never subsidise nuclear". He added: "It is essentially a subsidy of between what we calculate to be £800m to £1bn a year that the UK taxpayer and energy consumer will be putting into the deep pockets of Chinese and French corporations, which are essentially their governments." Chinese companies China National Nuclear Corporation and China General Nuclear Power Corporation will be minority shareholders in the project. The move follows Chancellor George Osborne's announcement last week that Chinese firms would be allowed to invest in civil nuclear projects in the UK. Prime Minister David Cameron said that the new Hinkley Point plant was "an excellent deal for Britain and British consumers". "This underlines the confidence there is in Britain and makes clear that we are very much open for business," he added. Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has pledged to freeze energy prices for 20 months if he wins the next election, said the party supported the development of new nuclear power stations, but would scrutinise the terms of the deal to ensure it delivered value for money for consumers. "We've got the Prime Minister who says he can fix prices 35 years ahead for the energy companies but he can't freeze prices now for the consumer. No wonder we've got a cost of living crisis in this country," he added. The existing plant at Hinkley currently produces about 1% of the UK's total energy, but this is expected to rise to 7% once the expansion is complete in 2023. The announcement is not legally binding and it will be 2014 before EDF makes a final investment decision on the project. The plans will also require state aid clearance from the European Commission. But it comes as concerns about domestic energy bills move up the agenda, with SSE, British Gas and Npower, three of the UK's "big six" gas and electricity suppliers, all having announced price increases. The government estimates that with new nuclear power - including Hinkley - the average energy bill in 2030 will be £77 lower than it would have been without the new plants. Energy UK, the trade body for the industry, said the agreement on Hinkley was "good news". "Building new power stations is never quick or cheap, but in the case of Hinkley development, nothing goes on the bill until 2020," it said. About 25,000 jobs are expected to be created during construction of the power plant, as well as 900 permanent jobs during its 60-year operation. </body>

      <title>UK first in heart failure operation</title>
      <description>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time.</description>

      <body>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time. Patients with heart failure struggle to pump blood around the body and mild exercise can leave them breathless. Surgeons used a form of "cardiac sewing" to remove scar tissue and reduce the size of the heart so it pumps more efficiently. The operation took place at King's College Hospital in London. One common cause of heart failure is when the arteries which nourish the organ become blocked, leading to a heart attack. Heart muscle dies and is replaced by hard scar tissue which does not beat. Over time, the scar tissue can stretch so chambers of the heart become larger, meaning the organ has more blood to force out with each heartbeat. The overall effect is a weaker heart, less able to do its job, transforming simple day-to-day tasks like climbing stairs into extreme exertions. In the operation, surgeons used a wire with anchors at both ends to pierce two sections of heart muscle. When the wire was tightened, the walls of the heart were "remodelled". The scar tissue was effectively removed and the volume of one of the chambers of the heart was reduced by a quarter. Sevket Gocer, 58 and from Bromley in south-east London, was the first patient to be treated in the UK. His heart function is said to have "improved significantly" after the operation. A similar procedure used to be performed by opening up the chest and stopping the heart, but it was a very risky operation and fell out of medical practice. Surgeons hope the less invasive operation, which can be performed while the heart is still pumping, will be a better option for patients. Mr Olaf Wendler, a professor of cardiac surgery at King's College Hospital, told the BBC: "In the technique we have now used for the first time in the UK, one does not need to stop the heart, one does not even necessarily need to place the patient on a heart-lung machine. "It's a less traumatic and less invasive type of procedure." He said the operation was being tested in a trial at hospitals across Europe and that the procedure could make a difference to patients' lives. He said: "[If successful] it's bringing them on to an exercise level where they're able to look after themselves properly including going to do the shopping and having a social life." Prof Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: "The results of this trial will determine if this experimental procedure is safe. "If the trial is successful, there will be further use of the technology as surgeons gain expertise in the technique. As more people are treated with this procedure, it will become fully clear whether it will have a real benefit for patients." </body>

      <body>A school has been forced to close because of an outbreak of Britain's most venomous spider. The Dean Academy, in the Forest of Dean, said it "had identified an issue with false widow spiders" in its ICT block and other areas of the site. A letter from vice-principal Craig Burns to parents said the school would be shut on Wednesday to be fumigated. Conservationists believe a change in the climate could be the cause of an increase in sightings of the species. In the letter, Mr Burns said the school had taken immediate pest control advice on discovery of the spiders. Initially the decision was taken to close the ICT block but further discoveries of the species elsewhere have led to a full school closure. "This will enable pest control to fumigate every area in the academy and ensure everyone's health and safety," Mr Burns wrote. "There have been no reports of anyone being bitten by the false widow spiders at the academy but if you have any concerns please seek medical advice." The school is expected to be open as normal on Thursday. The false widow (Steatoda nobilis) is about the size of a 50p coin and is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known in Britain. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Symptoms can include severe swelling, chest pains and tingling of fingers, with the severity depending on the amount of venom injected. Gloucestershire spider recorder David Haigh said people would have to be "very unlucky" to be bitten by one as they do not move very quickly and are not aggressive. He said he has never heard of a school being closed due to spiders, but said recent media attention on the False Widow has led to greater awareness. </body>

      <body>Social media has lit up with earthquake rumours after a giant oarfish washed up on a California beach - the second such discovery in several days. The 4.3m (14ft) dead snake-like fish was found in the city of Oceanside - five days after another and larger specimen (5.5m) had been found. Reports on social media recall an ancient Japanese myth linking extremely rare oarfish sightings to tremors. But scientists remain sceptical of any link to increased tectonic activity. They remain puzzled, however, by the two discoveries of this rare deepwater fish near the beach. The larger specimen, found on Santa Catalina island, has now been dissected and it appears well-fed, healthy and with little sign of disease. "It looks good enough to eat - if you have a 13ft pan," biologist Ruff Zetter said. Tests are also being done for radiation, following Japan's Fukushima nuclear leak on the other side of the Pacific. But it is also a rare chance to gather information about a little-known species that hovers vertically in the ocean and grazes on passing proteins. The elusive fish - which can grow up to 15m - dives to depth of up to 1,000m and is found in all temperate to tropical waters. </body>

      <title>'Electronic blood' computer tested</title>
      <description>A new brain-inspired computing device powered via a liquid instead of through wires has been demonstrated at IBM's Zurich laboratory.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24571219</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70552000/jpg/_70552415_8549310302_50612fbc36_c.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>IBM has unveiled a prototype of a new brain-inspired computer powered by what it calls "electronic blood". The firm says it is learning from nature by building computers fuelled and cooled by a liquid, like our minds. The human brain packs phenomenal computing power into a tiny space and uses only 20 watts of energy - an efficiency IBM is keen to match. Its new "redox flow" system pumps an electrolyte "blood" through a computer, carrying power in and taking heat out. A very basic model was demonstrated this week at the technology giant's Zurich lab by Dr Patrick Ruch and Dr Bruno Michel. Their vision is that by 2060, a one petaflop computer that would fill half a football field today, will fit on your desktop. "We want to fit a supercomputer inside a sugarcube. To do that, we need a paradigm shift in electronics - we need to be motivated by our brain," says Michel. "The human brain is 10,000 times more dense and efficient than any computer today. "That's possible because it uses only one - extremely efficient - network of capillaries and blood vessels to transport heat and energy - all at the same time." IBM's brainiest computer to date is Watson, which famously trounced two champions of the US TV quiz show Jeopardy. The victory was hailed as a landmark for cognitive computing - machine had surpassed man. But the contest was unfair, says Michel. The brains of Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter ran on only 20 watts of energy, whereas Watson needed 85,000 watts. Energy efficiency - not raw computing power - is the guiding principle for the next generation of computer chips, IBM believes. Our current 2D silicon chips, which for half a century have doubled in power through Moore's Law, are approaching a physical limit where they cannot shrink further without overheating. "The computer industry uses $30bn of energy and throws it out of the window. We're creating hot air for $30bn," says Michel. "Ninety-nine per cent of a computer's volume is devoted to cooling and powering. Only 1% is used to process information. And we think we've built a good computer?" "The brain uses 40% of its volume for functional performance - and only 10% for energy and cooling." Michel's vision is for a new "bionic" computing architecture, inspired by one of the laws of nature - allometric scaling - where an animal's metabolic power increases with its body size. An elephant, for example, weighs as much as a million mice. But it consumes 30 times less energy, and can perform a task even a million mice cannot accomplish. The same principle holds true in computing, says Michel, whose bionic vision has three core design features. The first is 3D architecture, with chips stacked high, and memory storage units interwoven with processors. "It's the difference between a low-rise building, where everything is spread out flat, and a high rise building. You shorten the connection distances," says Matthias Kaiserswerth, director of IBM Zurich. But there is a very good reason today's chips are gridiron pancakes - exposure to the air is critical to dissipate the intense heat generated by ever-smaller transistors. Piling chips on top of one another locks this heat inside - a major roadblock to 3D computing. IBM's solution is integrated liquid cooling - where chips are interlayered with tiny water pipes. The art of liquid cooling has been demonstrated by Aquasar and put to work inside the German supercomputer SuperMUC which - perversely - harnesses warm water to cool its circuits. SuperMUC consumes 40% less electricity as a result. But for IBM to truly match the marvels of the brain, there is a third evolutionary step it must achieve - simultaneous liquid fuelling and cooling. Just as blood gives sugar in one hand and takes heat with another, IBM is looking for a fluid that can multitask. Vanadium is the best performer in their current laboratory test system - a type of redox flow unit - similar to a simple battery. First a liquid - the electrolyte - is charged via electrodes, then pumped into the computer, where it discharges energy to the chip. Redox flow is far from a new technology, and neither is it especially complex. But IBM is the first to stake its chips on this "electronic blood" as the food of future computers - and will attempt to optimise it over the coming decades to achieve zettascale computing. "To power a zettascale computer today would take more electricity than is produced in the entire world," says Michel. He is confident that the design hurdles in his bionic model can be surmounted - not least that a whole additional unit is needed to charge the liquid. And while other labs are betting on spintronics, quantum computing, or photonics to take us beyond silicon, the Zurich team believes the real answer lies right behind our eyes. "Just as computers help us understand our brains, if we understand our brains we'll make better computers," says director Matthias Kaiserswerth. He would like to see a future Watson win Jeopardy on a level playing field. Other experts in computing agree that IBM's 3D principles are sound. But as to whether bionic computing will be the breakthrough technology, the jury is out. "The idea of using a fluid to both power and cool strikes me as very novel engineering - killing two birds with one stone," says Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey's computing department. "But every form of future computing has its champions - whether it be quantum computing, DNA computing or neuromorphic computing. "There is a long way to go from the lab to having one of these sitting under your desk." Prof Steve Furber, leader of the SpiNNaker project agrees that "going into the third dimension" has more to offer than continually shrinking transistors. "The big issue with 3D computing is getting the heat out - and liquid cooling could be very effective if integrated into 3D systems as proposed here," he told the BBC. "But all of the above will not get electronics down to the energy-efficiency of the brain. "That will require many more changes, including a move to analogue computation instead of digital. "It will also involve breakthroughs in new non-Turing models of computation, for example based on an understanding of how the brain processes information." </body>

      <body>A study on a Jersey site that revealed a significant piece of late Neanderthal history has been published. Scientists working on an archaeological dig in St Brelade said teeth found at La Cotte suggest Jersey was one of the last places Neanderthals lived. The team of British archaeologists have unearthed items which show the presence of Stone Age hunters at the headland. They said the finds were helping scientists understand more about the early relatives of modern humans. A large portion of the site contains sediments dating to the last Ice Age, preserving 250,000 years of climate change and archaeological evidence. The site, which has produced more Neanderthal stone tools than the rest of the British Isles put together, contains the only known late Neanderthal remains from North West Europe. Dr Matt Pope of the Institute of Archaeology at University College London, who helped lead the research, said: "In terms of the volume of sediment, archaeological richness and depth of time, there is nothing else like it known in the British Isles. "Given that we thought these deposits had been removed entirely by previous researchers, finding that so much still remains is as exciting as discovering a new site." The team dated sediments at the site using a technique called optically stimulated luminesce, which measures the last time sand grains were exposed to sunlight. Dr Pope said the results showed that part of the sequence of sediments dates between 100,000 and 47,000 years old, indicating that Neanderthal teeth which were discovered at the site in 1910 were younger than previously thought, and "probably belonged to one of the last Neanderthals to live in the region". Professor Clive Gamble, from the University of Southampton and archaeology member of the Natural Environment Research Council, said: "Archaeologists need dates like an artist needs paint. Without a sound chronology the power of our other techniques for probing the past are severely restricted. "This is a great step forward on what looks like being a fascinating journey." The wider project, supported also by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the Jersey Government, will continue to investigate the site and material excavated from it over the past 110 years. </body>

      <title>Syria: Polio outbreak fears</title>
      <description>Experts are concerned that polio may have made a return in war-torn Syria.</description>

      <body>Experts are concerned that polio may have made a return to war-torn Syria. The World Health Organization says it has received reports of the first suspected outbreak in the country in 14 years. Syrian's Ministry of Public Health is launching an urgent response, but experts fear the disease will be hard to control amid civil unrest. Immunisation is almost impossible to carry out in regions under intense shellfire. As a result, vaccination rates have been waning - from 95% in 2010 to an estimated 45% in 2013. At least a third of the country's public hospitals are out of service, and in some areas, up to 70% of the health workforce has fled. Outbreak risks have also increased due to overcrowding, poor sanitation and deterioration in water supply. More than four million Syrians who have relocated to less volatile areas of the country are mostly living in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. The WHO says it is already seeing increased cases of measles, typhoid and hepatitis A in Syria. Dr Jaouad Mahjour, director of the department for communicable diseases at WHO's regional office for the Eastern Mediterranean, said: "Given the scale of population movement both inside Syria and across borders, together with deteriorating environmental health conditions, outbreaks are inevitable." The cluster of suspected polio cases was detected in early October 2013 in Deir al-Zour province. Initial results from a laboratory in Damascus indicate that at least two of the cases could indeed be polio. A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases. Supplementary immunisation activities in neighbouring countries are currently being planned. WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-infected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Most people infected with the poliovirus have no signs of illness and are never aware they have been infected. These symptomless people carry the virus in their intestines and can "silently" spread the infection to thousands of others before the first case of polio paralysis emerges. Polio is spread by eating food or drink contaminated with faeces or, more rarely, directly from person-to-person via saliva. </body>

      <body>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking, researchers have shown. The US team believe the "waste removal system" is one of the fundamental reasons for sleep. Their study, in the journal Science, showed brain cells shrink during sleep to open up the gaps between neurons and allow fluid to wash the brain clean. They also suggest that failing to clear away some toxic proteins may play a role in brain disorders. One big question for sleep researchers is why do animals sleep at all when it leaves them vulnerable to predators? It has been shown to have a big role in the fixing of memories in the brain and learning, but a team at the University of Rochester Medical Centre believe that "housework" may be one of the primary reasons for sleep. "The brain only has limited energy at its disposal and it appears that it must choose between two different functional states - awake and aware or asleep and cleaning up," said researcher Dr Maiken Nedergaard. "You can think of it like having a house party. You can either entertain the guests or clean up the house, but you can't really do both at the same time." Their findings build on last year's discovery of the brain's own network of plumbing pipes - known as the glymphatic system - which carry waste material out of the brain. Scientists, who imaged the brains of mice, showed that the glymphatic system became 10-times more active when the mice were asleep. Cells in the brain, probably the glial cells which keep nerve cells alive, shrink during sleep. This increases the size of the interstitial space, the gaps between brain tissue, allowing more fluid to be pumped in and wash the toxins away. Dr Nedergaard said this was a "vital" function for staying alive, but did not appear to be possible while the mind was awake. She told the BBC: "This is purely speculation, but it looks like the brain is losing a lot of energy when pumping water across the brain and that is probably incompatible with processing information." She added that the true significance of the findings would be known only after human studies, but doing similar experiments in an MRI machine would be relatively easy. Commenting on the research Dr Neil Stanley, an independent sleep expert, said: "This is a very interesting study that shows sleep is essential downtime to do some housekeeping to flush out neurotoxins. "There is good data on memory and learning, the psychological reason for sleep. But this is the actual physical and chemical reason for sleep, something is happening which is important." Dr Raphaelle Winsky-Sommerer, a lecturer in sleep at Surrey University, said: "It's not surprising, our whole physiology is changing during sleep. "The novelty is the role of the interstitial space, but I think it's an added piece of the puzzle not the whole mechanism. "The significance is that, yet again, it shows sleep may contribute to the restoration of brain cell function and may have protective effects." Many conditions which lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease are characterised by the build-up of damaged proteins in the brain. The researchers suggest that problems with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to such diseases, but caution more research is needed. The charity Alzheimer's Research UK said more research would be needed to see whether damage to the brain's waste clearance system could lead to diseases like dementia, but the findings offered a "potential new avenue for investigation". </body>

      <title>Clawed fossil had spider-like brain</title>
      <description>A clawed spider-like creature reveals the most intact nervous system ever observed in an ancient fossil, 520 million years old.</description>

      <body>Scientists have discovered the best-preserved nervous system in an ancient fossil. Dating back 520 million years, the clawed spider-like fossil shows clear evidence of a brain and of nerve cords running through the creature's trunk. The specimen now confirms that the ancestors of spiders and scorpions were related, but branched off more than half-a-billion years ago. A team of international scientists present their work in Nature. The "great appendage" arthropods, are an extinct group of joint-legged creatures with large claw-like appendages - or growths - protruding from their heads. The nervous system tends to be similar between major groups of animals, which helps palaeontologists work out how they are related, explained Greg Edgecombe from the Natural History Museum in London. "The nervous system is one of the more reliable tool-kits we have. We were trying to investigate whether there was evidence for the preservation of neural tissues from very early parts of the animal fossil record," he told BBC News. "What we've been working with is fossils with very fine anatomical preservation from the Cambrian period. These have given us information about brains, the nerve cords and the neural tissue that goes into the eyes." New to science, the fossil was recently discovered in South China and is part of the genus Alalcomenaeus. This group had segmented bodies equipped with about a dozen pairs of appendages which enabled the creatures to swim or crawl. It was placed in a CT scanner and compared with other arthropods in order to understand its evolution. The team then used 3D software to see structures not visible on the surface of the fossil. "People like myself who are mad keen on creepy crawlies want to understand how very strange early arthropods relate to living ones," added Dr Edgecombe. "By having access to the nervous system it allows us to study the evolutionary relationships of very ancient fossils using the same kind of information that we would use for living animals." Co-author, Xiaoya Ma, also from the Natural History Museum, said: "It is very exciting to use new techniques to successfully reveal such a complete central nervous system from a 520-million-year old fossil, and in such detail." She told the BBC's Science in Action programme that the high resolution of the reconstructed image allowed the team to see "the concentrated neural structures in the head region". They could also observe the segments of the brain associated with the claw-like appendages. The fossil belongs to an extinct group of marine arthropods known as megacheirans, Greek for "large claws". To infer the evolutionary relationships between species, the fields of palaeontology and neuroanatomy together. Nicholas Strausfeld was from the anatomy side of the team at the University of Arizona, US. "We now know that the megacheirans had central nervous systems very similar to today's horseshoe crabs and scorpions," said Prof Strausfeld. "This means the ancestors of spiders and their kin lived side by side with the ancestors of crustaceans in the Lower Cambrian." He added that their prominent appendages were clearly used for grasping and holding. "Based on their location, we can now say that the biting mouthparts in spiders and their relatives evolved from these appendages." The team says they expect to find more fossils dating even further back, which will shed new light onto the ancestors of many of today's arthropods. </body>

      <title>Meteorite pulled from Russian lake</title>
      <description>Divers working at a Russian lake have recovered a 570kg chunk of the space rock that exploded over Chelyabinsk earlier this year.</description>

      <body>Divers working at a Russian lake have recovered a half-tonne chunk of the space rock that exploded over Chelyabinsk earlier this year. The object plunged into Lake Chebarkul in central Russia on 15 February, leaving a 6m-wide hole in the ice. Scientists say that it is the largest fragment of the meteorite yet found. More than 1,000 people were injured when a 17m, 10,000-tonne space rock burned up over Central Russia, breaking windows and rocking buildings. Live footage showed a team pull out a 1.5-metre-long (five-foot-long) rock from the lake after first wrapping it in a special covering and placing it on a metal sheet while it was still underwater. The rock broke into three parts as it was pulled from the depths. Once ashore, it was placed on top of a scale for weighing. However, the scale broke as it hit the 570kg (1,255lb) mark. Dr Caroline Smith, curator of meteorites at London's Natural History Museum, confirmed that the object was a meteorite from characteristic features known as fusion crust and regmaglypts, which are obvious in images. She told BBC News: "Fusion crust forms as the meteoroid is travelling through the atmosphere as a fireball. "The outer surface gets so hot it melts the rock to form a dark, glassy surface crust which we term a fusion crust. Regmaglypts are the indentations, that look a bit like thumbprints, also seen on the surface of the meteorite." Sergey Zamozdra, an associate professor at Chelyabinsk State University, told the Interfax news agency: "The preliminary examination... shows that this is really a fraction of the Chelyabinsk meteorite. "This chunk is most probably one of the top 10 biggest meteorite fragments ever found." The divers' mission had been hampered by a number of factors. The rock fragment lay at 13m depth, not 6m or 8m as was originally thought. The Vesti 24 rolling news channel reported that divers had already recovered more than 12 pieces from Lake Chebarkul since the incident on 15 February. The station said that only four or five of them had turned out to be real meteorites. </body>

      <body>The badger cull in Gloucestershire could be halted after a legal challenge from a charity which says plans to extend the culling period are illegal. An eight-week extension to the cull was requested after a failure to kill the minimum number of badgers during a six-week pilot aimed at curbing bovine TB. In a letter, the Badger Trust said it would be "unlawful" for Natural England "to grant a further licence". Defra said it could not comment on the letter for "legal reasons". It said 708 badgers had been killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Nigel Gibbens, chief veterinary officer, advised the cull should be extended. Defra said culls were "important to tackle bovine TB". A Defra spokesman said: "That is why these pilot culls are so important. We have to use every tool in the box because TB is so difficult to eradicate and it is spreading rapidly." The Badger Trust said it was asking Natural England to consider their letter when looking at the application to "grant a fresh licence" to shoot badgers in Gloucestershire. The letter used quotes from original statements from ministers and officials who the trust said had talked of the cull having "a maximum period of six weeks". The trust said it believed the cull had "met its purpose in testing the 'effectiveness' and had shown it not to be effective". A licence was granted last week to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November. </body>

      <title>Vets raise fears over rabies threat</title>
      <description>Scientists are warning that the rabies threat to the UK has increased following changes to quarantine rules.</description>

      <body>Scientists are warning that the rabies threat to the UK has increased following changes to quarantine rules. Veterinary experts and animal welfare groups have told the BBC they are concerned they no longer provide adequate protection against the threat of the disease. "There is enough evidence from people on the front line that the risk has increased as a result of the changes," said veterinary surgeon Prof Sheila Crispin. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) says the risk of a dog with rabies coming into the UK is very low. It estimated the new rules mean there would be one case of rabies in a pet in the UK once every 211 years, with the possibility of a person dying from rabies obtained from a pet once in every 21,000 years. Before January 2012, the Pet Travel Scheme required animals to be microchipped, vaccinated against rabies and then blood tested. After a further six months they would be allowed entry to the UK. But changes to the scheme, aimed at bringing the UK into line with the rest of Europe, mean animals from the EU and approved non-EU countries such as the US and Australia no longer need a blood test and now have to wait only 21 days following vaccination. Under the new rules, it means animals coming from France are treated the same as dogs coming from parts of Eastern Europe where rabies is endemic. Prof Sheila Crispin, former president of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, said the decision to do away with the need for a blood test had also removed a vital check in the system. "For something as important as rabies you really want to know that the vaccine has worked. To wait 21 days and import the animal could be construed as a risk - add to that that the incubation period for rabies can go beyond 21 days and then potentially you have a problem," she says. During 2011, according to Defra figures, 85,774 dogs entered the UK under the Pet Travel Scheme. In 2012, that rose to 139,216 dogs - an increase of 62%. A risk assessment was carried out by Defra before the changes to the Pet Travel Scheme were introduced last year. Prof Crispin says the risk assessment was compiled on the basis that there would be 100% compliance with the new regulations - but that is not realistic, she says. "The trouble is many people have regarded the relaxation as a wonderful opportunity to be dishonest and there's been a huge increase - something like 400% in the first year - of illegal imports, and they are the ones we know about," she says. It is thought the increase is due to illegal smugglers being prepared to run the risk of getting caught, knowing that although they will be liable to pay kennel costs they will get the dogs back after three weeks in quarantine rather than six months. They mostly smuggle puppies into the country because they are easier to sell than mature dogs. Some of the dogs being smuggled into Britain are coming from Eastern Europe, where rabies is found. Animal charities have told the BBC that the quarantine changes, along with the problem of illegal dogs, have left them concerned about the potential risk facing their employees. "The quarantine regulations we have don't reflect the incubation period of rabies. It's not a case of scaremongering, but I think repeating the risk assessment would be a way of doing that, " said Paula Boyden, veterinary director at the Dogs Trust. The Dogs Trust charity is now considering offering rabies vaccinations to front-line staff as a precautionary measure. "At the moment we are monitoring the situation quite carefully. We're certainly considering it," said Paula Boyden. The Dogs Trust is not alone. Battersea Dogs and Cats Home is also in talks over whether to begin offering rabies vaccinations to some of its workers. "We're giving it serious consideration at the moment. It's a three-week wait after the animal has had the vaccination but the incubation period for rabies is anything from two to 12 weeks or even longer, " said Shaun Opperman, veterinary director at the home. In a statement, Defra said: "The risk of a dog with rabies coming into the UK is very low and the risk of rabies being passed from a pet to a person is lower still. "We continue to monitor the situation and will undertake a further, formal risk assessment if we feel that it is warranted." According to Defra, the last case of rabies in dogs in the UK outside of quarantine was in a dog imported from Pakistan in 1970. 5 live investigates will be broadcast on Sunday, 20 October at 11:00 BST </body>

      <title>'Missing' badgers: call for answers</title>
      <description>Conservationists are calling for an investigation into plummeting badger numbers in the run up to the cull.</description>

      <body>Conservationists are calling for an investigation into plummeting badger numbers in the run up to the cull. The apparent 50% decline over a year before the cull started appears to be unprecedented, data from other badger populations suggests. Government officials have blamed the cold winter, disease or lack of food for the dwindling numbers. But a wildlife charity claims illegal killing of badgers may behind the fall in numbers and is calling for answers. Meanwhile, reports on social networks suggest protestors have been interfering with the hair traps used to assess badger numbers. This could potentially lead to errors in population estimates. There have been three official attempts to count badgers in west Somerset and west Gloucestershire in the run up to the cull. The first estimate - in October 2012 - concluded there were 3,644 badgers in west Gloucestershire and 4,289 in west Somerset. This was revised down in February this year to 3,368 in west Gloucestershire and 2,473 in west Somerset. Then, just before the cull began, a new estimate of the badger population was produced of 2,350 badgers in west Gloucestershire and 1,450 badgers in west Somerset. The data suggests the population in both areas has fallen from around 8,000 badgers in October 2012, to around 4,000 badgers a year later, across both zones. Defra have given a number of reasons for the apparent 50% decline, including the impact of last winter's bad weather, disease and lack of food. "These badger populations go up and down," the environment secretary Owen Paterson said last week. "We're dealing with a wild animal, whose numbers will go up and down depending on weather, disease and other conditions." However, wildlife charities are concerned that illegal killing of badgers may be behind the fall in numbers. Last week, it was claimed that farmers in the Somerset cull zone had admitted to gassing badgers. The wildlife charity, Care for the Wild, is among those calling for an inquiry into the "missing" badgers. Policy officer Dominic Dyer said it was a serious issue and he would like to see more answers from the secretary of state. "A climate has been created which allows certain individuals to believe they can carry out illegal killing and will not get prosecuted," he said. "And I think that has got much worse over the past 12 months, and that's shared by many people in the wildlife conservation movement as well. "I don't think we have got an accurate feel now for what the numbers are - and we are continuing to cull, that is a very dangerous combination." Data on wild badger populations in England is sparse. However, two badger populations have been well studied - at Wytham Wood in Oxfordshire and at Woodchester Park in Gloucestershire. If factors such as poor weather and lack of food are behind the fall in badger numbers in the cull zones, similar fluctuations would be expected in neighbouring populations, say scientists. A Defra report summarising 25 years of population studies between 1982 and 2006 shows rises and falls in the badger population at Woodchester Park over this time period, but not on a level comparable with the fall reported over the past year. Defra has not given recent information on the badger population at Woodchester Park. But a source said that while badger populations at Woodchester Park do show fluctuations, the biggest change year-on-year is about 17%. Prof Rosie Woodroffe of the London Zoological Society has studied badgers for many years, including at Wytham Wood. She said the difference between last year's and this year's estimates of badger numbers in the cull zone was "very large by the standards of normal fluctuations in badger numbers". They "did not see fluctuations of the magnitude claimed for the Somerset and Gloucestershire cull zones" at Wytham Wood, Prof Woodroffe told the BBC. "I think it would be extremely unusual for such a decline to occur through natural causes - especially over such large areas. "Two possible explanations for the difference in numbers relate to problems with the estimation methods (which are rather opaque and have been subjected to interference by protestors), and to the possibility of illegal killing. "I don't think there's any way to distinguish between these two with the publicly available information, but I'd think either was more likely than a natural decline," she added. Robbie McDonald of the Environment and Sustainability Institute at the University of Exeter said it is hard to discern in any wildlife survey the degree to which observed change is due to genuine population change or error in estimates. He told BBC News: "In general, any estimate of a wildlife population comprises genuine change in that population and then error in population estimations. So there's both of those two things." Defra said in a statement that population estimates for Woodchester for 2013 are not available, and it would not be possible to carry out a comparison between Woodchester Park and the cull areas because the sizes of the areas are so different. "Fluctuations in numbers of wildlife populations occur for a range of complex reasons that it is difficult to assess," said a spokesperson. "We are not speculating on the causes for the drop in the badger population." A spokesperson for the NFU said: "The NFU has no evidence of the illegal killing of badgers. The NFU does not condone any illegal activity that results in the killing of wildlife. "Anyone with any evidence of the illegal killing of badgers or any other wildlife should report it to the police wildlife crime unit so it can be investigated." </body>

      <title>Bee-friendly plants put to the test</title>
      <description>An experimental garden has revealed that the right plants can attract up to 100 times more pollinators, say scientists.</description>

      <body>Researchers have used an experimental garden to put pollinator-friendly plants to the test. The University of Sussex scientists counted the number of insects visiting the plants in their garden. They say their findings show that insect-friendly plants are just as pretty, cheap and easy to grow as less pollinator-friendly varieties. Their results are published in the Journal of Functional Ecology. PhD student Mihail Garbuzov used 32 different varieties of popular garden plants. These included some nectar-rich and highly scented plants he thought would be attractive to insects and some that seemed to be less attractive. While the small-scale study did not produce an exhaustive list of the best plants for pollinating insects, the team says the data has put a number on just how many more pollinators the right plants can attract. Mr Garbuzov told the BBC: "Some of the best plants attracted approximately 100 times as many insects as the worst. "And the plants that are attractive to insects are not more expensive, and they're just as pretty." The researchers wrote in their paper that there was "great scope for making gardens and parks more insect friendly" by selecting the right plants. Tips for insect-friendly gardening are already available from a variety of sources, but the researchers say they are largely based on "opinion and general experience". The aim of this study, said Prof Francis Ratnieks, from the University of Sussex, was to "put that advice on a firmer scientific footing, by gathering information about the actual number of insects visiting the flowers to collect nectar or pollen". The researchers gathered their data simply by visiting each of the patches of flowers every day over two summers and counting the number of insects on the flowers. Their results did lead them to make some horticultural recommendations - they found that borage, lavender, marjoram and open-flower dahlias varieties were very good for insects. The colourfully named bowles mauve everlasting wallflower was also very attractive to pollinators, while the least attractive flowering plant for insects was the very popular geranium. Marjoram, the researchers say, was probably the best "all-rounder", attracting honey bees, bumble bees, other bees, hover flies, and butterflies. Borage was the best for honey bees and lavender and open-flowered dahlias were most attractive to bumblebees. The team put a number of varieties of lavender to the test and found that highly bred hybrids, including some with novel colours - such as white or pink - that have been carefully bred into the plants proved the most attractive to insects. Dr Nigel Raine, from Royal Holloway University of London, commented that with bee populations declining across the world, "we can all give bees a helping hand by planting the right flowers to give them the nectar and pollen they need". "This study highlights that it's important for bee-friendly gardeners to choose what you plant with care," he added. "Gardeners and town planners should think carefully about the mixture of flowers they plant to ensure food is available for a wide range of bees and other important insect pollinators. "It's also important to cater for the needs of the rarer species and provide food at times when there might be fewer wild flowers in bloom." </body>

      <title>Monkeys 'take turns in conversation'</title>
      <description>Marmosets engage in what appears to be "polite conversation", taking it in turns to vocalise, according to researchers.</description>

      <body>Marmoset monkeys take it in turns to "talk" in a pattern very similar to human conversation, according to scientists. Researchers recorded the sounds of the marmosets as they called to one another from behind a curtain. Each animal would call, then wait for the other to respond before calling again. The results suggest an "alternative evolutionary route" for our own conversational turn-taking. They are reported in the journal Current Biology. It is something we take for granted in our conversations, but taking it in turns to talk and listen is crucial for us to effectively exchange information through what we say. Somewhat mysteriously though, we do not see an obvious origin in our closest primate relatives - the chimpanzees. Chimps are not very vocal and tend to use their repertoire of gestures to communicate, so it is widely accepted that these manual gestures provided the foundations for the co-operation inherent in our own communication. But Dr Asif Ghazanfar from Princeton University set out to look for evidence of a vocal route for this co-operation, by looking at vocal exchanges in marmosets. He explained that he chose marmosets precisely because, unlike chimps, they are very vocal. It is one of two main characteristics the monkeys share with humans, Dr Ghazanfar said. "They're [also] co-operative breeders - so they help one another take care of their offspring. "That's an important characteristic because it leads to greater pro-sociality (meaning the animals, like us, carry out behaviours that are intended to benefit others)." The lead researcher, Daniel Takahashi, recorded marmosets calling to one another from opposite corners of a room. The animals were separated by a curtain, so each could hear but not see the other. The recordings revealed that the marmosets would wait for about five seconds after the other finished calling to respond - seemingly following "unspoken rules of conversational etiquette". Dr Ghazanfar explained that there were two ideas for why the animals followed these rules. "One is, if you're out of sight of your group members and want to establish contact with another, you only know if you've established that contact if their response is contingent on your own," he explained to BBC News. "And the other hypothesis is that these calls they exchange might have information content [that needs to be digested]." Dr Ghazanfar says that our own conversational turn-taking might have evolved via a similar route - although on a parallel branch of the evolutionary tree. This provides an alternative explanation to the somewhat "mysterious step" it is suggested occurred as the patterns in chimp-like gestural exchanges evolved into the patterns of our own vocal communication. The team hopes that continued study of the marmosets will help to reveal more about why our own conversation can sometimes break down. "We are currently exploring how very early life experiences in marmosets - including those in the womb and through to parent-infant vocal interactions - can illuminate what goes awry in human communication disorders," said Dr Ghazanfar. </body>

      <title>Uganda seizes massive ivory haul</title>
      <description>Some two tonnes (4,600lb) of ivory is seized in Uganda - one of the country's biggest such hauls for many years, officials say.</description>

      <body>Ugandan officials have seized some two tonnes (4,600lb) of ivory - one of the country's biggest such hauls for many years. The Uganda Wildlife Association (UWA) has said the 832 pieces of ivory could be worth up to $6.7m but other estimates put the value lower. Experts say some of the ivory is believed to have come from elephants poached outside Uganda. There is a huge demand for African ivory in Asia for use in ornaments. The ivory was apparently heading for the Kenyan port of Mombasa. Some of the tusks had been broken up and covered with plastic bottles in crates labelled as material to be recycled. The UWA told the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga that Uganda is increasingly being used as a transit country by poachers who kill elephants in states such as South Sudan or the Democratic Republic of Congo. Uganda is believed to have about 5,000 elephants and this haul would represent the tusks from about 400 animals. Last week, some four tonnes of ivory was found in Mombasa after coming from Uganda. According to the UWA, the rate of elephant poaching is relatively low in Uganda, with an estimated 20 elephants killed for their ivory across the country in 2010. After a sharp fall in the number of elephants in Africa, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) banned the trade in ivory in 1989 But in recent years poaching has increased across sub-Saharan Africa with criminal gangs slaughtering elephants for ivory markets in Asia. </body>

      <body>A zoo's two new kittens could have a future role in a project to breed Scottish wildcats in captivity for possible release into the wild. Ness and Einich were born at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland's (RZSS) Highland Wildlife Park at Kincraig, near Aviemore. RZSS and the Aspinall Foundation are leading the plans for a conservation breeding programme. The wildlife park will be among the project's main breeding sites. RZSS said Ness and Einich may play a part in the programme, which is part of the wider Scottish Wildcat Conservation Action Plan unveiled last month and involves Scottish Natural Heritage. The cats are endangered in the wild. Breeding with feral cats, disease, habitat loss and fatal collisions with road traffic have caused a dramatic decline in their numbers. Only a few hundred pure-bred Scottish wildcats are thought to survive. Douglas Richardson, head of living collections at the Highland Wildlife Park, said the new kittens were the latest breeding success for the park. He said: "But with the wildcat action plan, the contribution that these little chaps may make in the future to their species' survival will hopefully be more impactful. "The plan is for a much more aggressively managed breeding programme, running alongside a wide range of other wildcat conservation initiatives that will eventually turn the tide for the species in Scotland." </body>

      <body>Despite being home to about 16,000 tree species, just 227 "hyperdominant" species account for half of Amazonia's total trees, a study suggests. An international team of researchers found that the region was, in total, home to an estimated 390 billion trees. Writing in Science, they added that the rarest 11,000 species made up only 0.12% of tree cover. However, they added that the new data could help unlock ecological secrets held by the biodiversity hotspot. The results were based on a survey of 1,170 plots and half-a-million trees across the six-million-square-kilometre area, often described as the lungs of the world. The authors said that the underlying cause of the hyper dominance of the 227 species, which accounted for 1.4% of the estimated number of species in the region, remained unknown. "We knew that, normally, a few species dominate ecosystems, but if you have a system that has 16,000 tree species but just 227 make up half of the trees, that was pretty surprising even for us," said lead author Dr Hans ter Steege from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands. He told the Science podcast: "We don't really know why these species are so incredibly dominant because they do not have any particular ecological feature that stands out." In the paper, Dr ter Steege and the team of more than 100 scientists wrote that there was no evidence that two key functional traits for trees - seed mass and wood density - played a part in determining what species dominated the landscape. "The 227 hyperdominant species include both shade-tolerant, typically large-seeded climax species with dense wood and shade-intolerant, small seeded pioneer (species) with light wood," they observed. The most dominant species was indentified as Euterpe precatoria, a palm tree native to central and southern America, with a mean estimate population of more than five billion individuals within Amazonia. Conversely, the researchers noted that the rarest 5,800 species had communities with fewer than 1,000 individuals, adding: "which is sufficient to classify those that are endemic as globally threatened". They suggested further analysis would show that the species identified as hyperdominant would be "disproportionately resistant to pathogens, specialist herbivores and other sources of frequency-dependent mortality". Dr ter Steege said the data could also be used by conservationists to find out what species were found in protected areas, such as national parks, and what ones were located in unprotected areas, and were therefore vulnerable to threat such as deforestation. </body>

      <title>Badger cull falls short of target</title>
      <description>The number of badgers culled during a six-week scheme in Gloucestershire has fallen short of its target, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson tells MPs.</description>

      <body>The number of badgers shot during a six-week cull in Gloucestershire has fallen short of its target, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has told MPs. Defra said 708 badgers had been killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Nigel Gibbens, chief veterinary officer, advised it should be extended. This could be for eight weeks. Badger campaigners have called the scheme a "massive failure" and said they would continue their protest . Mr Gibbens said extending the cull would achieve the "earliest and greatest possible impact" on bovine TB in Gloucestershire. Defra said Natural England was currently considering the application to extend the licence in Gloucestershire and a decision is "expected shortly". Mr Paterson told the BBC the cull figures were "not bad news" but admitted that those carrying out the killings had "got off to a slower start" in Gloucestershire. "We must remember that these are pilots," he said. "This has not been done before and we are learning, clearly, in each area. This isn't a sudden six-week period. These pilots are intended to go on for four years. "Up to to the end of July, a further 20,000 perfectly healthy cattle have been hauled off to slaughter at horrendous expense to the taxpayer because we've lost control of TB." Mr Paterson said 305,000 cattle had been "lost" over the past 10 years and it was "not acceptable" to allow the disease to go on. The badger cull in Gloucestershire ended this week. A licence was granted last week to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November. Defra said early indications from Gloucestershire are that, as in Somerset, the pilot had been "safe and humane". The government's original target was 2,900 badgers, based on a population estimate of 3,400 animals. The target was then revised to 1,650, from a population of 2,350. Last week Mr Paterson said the government was exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB. Stop the Badger Cull spokesman Jay Tiernan said the cull had been a "massive failure". "It's disgraceful," he said. "It clearly isn't safe, effective or humane. "It is time for someone to bite the bullet and admit it's been a failure." Mr Tiernan said protests against the culls would continue. </body>

      <body>Scientists have discovered that three species of dung beetle walk with a "galloping" gait not seen in any other insect. The vast majority of insects species walk with what is known as an alternating tripod gait - steadily moving forward three legs at a time. It is not clear why these flightless beetles have shifted so radically from the usual way of walking. The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology. Describing this strange gait in their paper, the researchers wrote: "Like a bounding hare, the beetles propel their body forward by synchronously stepping with both middle legs and then both front legs."

      <description>Dog virus is latest threat to Siberian tiger</description>

      <body>The Siberian tiger: majestic, enigmatic - the classic big cat precariously balanced on the edge of extinction. Threatened by deforestation and poaching to supply the black market trade in tiger body parts, it is one of the most endangered cats on the planet. But over the past decade or so, a new threat has emerged - a silent, insidious one - canine distemper virus. Worldwide there are an estimated 400-500 Siberian or Amur tigers. Exact numbers are hard to determine because this is a reclusive animal that is rarely observed. Yet, at the turn of the century, some of these otherwise withdrawn animals were seen wandering onto roads and into villages in the Russian Far East. They were fearless and docile, confused and dazed; the antithesis of their usual ferocious and wary demeanour. Over the next few years evidence mounted that this, the largest living felid, was suffering from an infectious agent and the indications - the nature of the illness, historical understanding of wild cat infections and the diagnosis, in a single wild tiger, of a virus belonging to the morbillivirus genus - provided a likely culprit. A study published in the journal mBio, confirmed these suspicions. Genetic analysis of several dead tiger samples showed that canine distemper virus was the cause. Canine distemper virus (CDV), a relative of the human measles virus, was first described in dogs and infection causes fatal pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). But this virus is incredibly promiscuous and can infect jump into a variety of different animals - usually with catastrophic effects. Two suspected CDV outbreaks, the first in 1988 and a second in 2000, killed thousands of Baikal then Caspian seals. The virus has also ripped through Africa, with fatal outbreaks in silver-backed jackals and bat-eared foxes and catastrophic die-offs in wild dog populations that continue to this day. For years, cats were thought resistant to CDV. Yes, domestic cats could be infected in the laboratory, but this was inefficient and the virus was unable to pass from one animal to another. A massive demise in 1994 of African lions living in the Serengeti national park in Tanzania showed that this was fallacy. This population of closely monitored lions succumbed to CDV. Whilst only 34 lion deaths were documented during the outbreak, this was only the tip of the iceberg. Before CDV struck, the lion population numbered 3,000, but afterwards this had fallen by a third. In the same outbreak, countless hyenas, bat-eared foxes and leopards also perished. Add to this the recent report of infection of large numbers of South American jaguar and it is evident that this virus has little, if any respect for the so-called species barrier - the unique inherent host factors and properties that prevent viruses from jumping from one species to another. In an intriguing turn of events, CDV was also starting to spark fatal outbreaks in various primates. So what should we make of the emergence of CDV infection in primates. Is this an indication of the potential for a more compelling species jump? Could CDV do the unthinkable and infect humans? The simple answer is a resounding yes. At least, in theory it is. To replicate, a virus has to get into a host cell. It does this through interactions between proteins on its surface with proteins - receptors - on the surface of the cell. These receptors act as gateways into the cell and if the virus protein fits then infection takes place. Different animals possess slightly different versions of these receptors on their cells so the virus proteins also have to change to be able to unlock them. A single mutation in one of surface proteins in CDV present in primates is all it takes for the virus to successfully use the human receptor. This is a tiny species barrier. But before banishing the pet dog to a high containment kennel then donning personal protective clothing before you go near, there's a key part of the story we need to consider - one that's probably been protecting us for all of these years. When you're exposed to a virus your body recognises it as foreign and your blood cells generate antibodies which bind to the virus surface proteins and protect us from infection. It's the basis for vaccination. Fortunately, the surface protein of the measles virus is so similar to CDV that antibodies generated by the measles vaccine also protect against CD; and other morbilliviruses too. But, if we ever eradicate measles and stop vaccination, maybe then we will be susceptible to CDV. But what of the Amur tiger - will CDV ensure its ultimate demise? As Dr Denise McAloose, lead author on the mBio paper, explained: "When you're talking about four to five hundred animals and your losing reproductive females and their offspring, the overall impact on populations is huge. "Some of the earlier modelling work, if it were to pan out, does suggest that this is a significant disease even at the levels of disease we are detecting now, which is probably just the tip of the iceberg." A bleak outlook that is shared by a University of Nottingham colleague, veterinary virologist Dr Rachael Tarlinton: "Because they are such tiny populations even relatively small mortality events can seriously harm their genetic diversity and this might just be enough to push them over the edge." Hopefully it's not too late. We know that CDV vaccines work and a targeted vaccination programme might just pull Amur tigers back from the brink. Current CDV vaccines have to be injected - no trivial task when the animal you want to protect is so difficult to track down and so dangerous to handle. But not all vaccines need to be injected - some very effective vaccines have been developed for oral delivery and these have been pivotal in our fight against rabies. In the late 1970s, Switzerland pioneered the widespread deployment of enticing baits laced with rabies vaccine that would be eaten by rabies-susceptible wild animals, thereby protecting them. So successful was this approach that following a similar campaign that spanned more than two decades, Germany was declared rabies-free. Whilst development of an oral vaccine is scientifically feasible, it is unlikely ever to become a reality. As Dr Tarlinton explains: "It was worth developing the oral bait vaccines for rabies because of the human zoonosis risk, but something for a purely veterinary disorder, particularly one that infects wildlife rather than livestock? It's difficult to justify the economics of doing it, even if we should." Even though vaccinating tigers is unfeasible there is an alternative: identify the reservoir and remove the virus at source through vaccination campaigns. This has proven very effective in protecting CDV-threatened lion populations in Africa. But do we know what the reservoir is? Domestic dogs have been implicated in all epidemics involving wildlife but, because the virus can infect other animals, you have to be sure. And this is what Dr McAloose and her colleagues have turned their attention to. "We have to understand if there's a reservoir. "We're trying to identify how the virus is cycling through the system to understand what the carriers are, and only with these results would we be able to make the appropriate recommendations." For the sake of the Amur tigers, I wish them well in their quest. </body>

      <description>India's mission to Mars set to stoke fires of new Asian space race</description>

      <body>The forthcoming launch of a spacecraft to Mars by India is likely to stoke the fires of a burgeoning Asian space race. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is making its final preparations to send an orbiter to the Red Planet. The principal aim is to test out India's space technology to see if this emerging space-faring nation is capable of interplanetary missions. The spacecraft will also collect scientific information about the planet's atmosphere and surface. The Mangalyaan probe was to have been launched as early as 28 October, but rough weather in the Pacific forced officials to delay the launch by a week. The unmanned mission has a launch window lasting until 19 November. If the mission succeeds, ISRO will become only the fourth space agency, after those in the US, Europe and Russia to have successfully sent a spacecraft to Mars. According to Pallava Bagla, science editor of New Delhi television news and author of a book about India's space efforts, Destination Moon, the country's public are especially excited about the possibility of beating China to the Red Planet. "If India does beat China to Mars you can imagine the national pride," he told BBC News. The mission was announced in August last year by India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during his independence day speech, delivered from the ramparts of one of New Delhi's most iconic buildings - the Red Fort. "Anything said from the ramparts of the Red Fort is always replete with national pride and national pride is written very largely and boldly on this mission," according to Mr Bagla. In 2011, a Chinese attempt to send a spacecraft named Yinghou-1 to Mars was aborted because of a technical problem. The Indian space agency then fast-tracked its Mars mission, called Mangalyaan, readying it in just 15 months. India has had a space programme for more than 30 years. Until recently, its priority has been to develop technologies that would directly help its poor population, such as improving its telecommunications infrastructure and environmental monitoring with satellites. But in 2008, ISRO translated its formidable capability to build and launch satellites toward exploration and send a probe to the Moon, Chandrayaan-1. The lunar mission cost more than £55m. Now the government has spent a further £60m to go to Mars. Some have questioned the government's shift away from building infrastructure towards exploration, and wonder whether the money could have been better spent. It is a point that draws this robust response from Mr Bagla: "You can't bring the 400 million people who live in poverty in India out of poverty with this £60 million," he says. The shift towards exploration is also a hard-headed one by officials in the hope that it will have clear economic benefits, according to Prof Andrew Coates, who rejoices in the impressive title of "Head of the Solar System" at the Mullard Space Sciences Laboratory in Surrey, part of University College London. "The exploration programme gives them something very high to aim for. If they can show the world they have what it takes to send spacecraft to other planets they can begin to sell launches and space on its launch vehicles to scientific organisations. It also brings India to the table of international space science exploration," Prof Coates explained. Developing satellites and developing launchers is now big business. If India, or for that matter China, ease up on their investments in space exploration there is a risk that they could lose out, not least on the vital expertise that this cutting edge endeavour brings to their respective countries. Sandeep Chachra, executive director of the poverty eradication charity Action Aid in India believes that investment in space exploration could potentially benefit the country's poorest. "Investing in new technology, including space technology is an important part of the aspirations for an economy such as India. Developing a sophisticated technological base in a country with this level of poverty is not a simplistic contradiction " he told BBC News. "What is important is to harness the advances that science and technology bring for the greater good and to use those advances to overcome ingrained poverty and build hope for future generations". China though remains the greater power in space. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has a well developed astronaut programme and an orbiting laboratory called Tiangong-1. The CNSA is planning to send its Chang'e-3 spacecraft and accompanying rover to the Moon in December. The mission is part of an ambitious plan to send more robotic probes to the Moon with a view to eventually sending astronauts to the lunar surface. The Japanese Space Agency (Jaxa) is also a major force in the region. It is by far the most experienced Asian space agency, with numerous unmanned scientific interplanetary missions under its belt. "India, China and Japan are certainly eyeing each other up," says Prof Coates. The growing rivalry is likely to see a new boom in space exploration - one that will eventually lead to more collaborative missions between the emerging space-faring nations in Asia. That might eventually lead to a truly global effort to send astronauts to Mars. Follow Pallab on Twitter </body>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <title>China: Opportunity and risk for hi-tech firms</title>
      <description>China a land of opportunity and risk for hi-tech companies</description>

      <body>The UK Chancellor George Osborne said this morning that Britain tends to view China as a "sweatshop on the Pearl River". In reality, he told the Today programme, "it's at the forefront of medicine and hi-tech and computing". An official tweeted a picture of him, headphones on, gazing out at the grey urban landscape of Beijing. To coincide with his visit - and that of science minister David Willetts - a new report calls for China to be seen as a land of scientific opportunity not a black hole of intellectual theft and cybercrime. The study is by Nesta, a think tank founded to promote innovation, and it argues that the massive and growing scale of Chinese science means it is simply "too big to ignore"- spending about $500m on research every day and employing a quarter of the world's RandD workforce. A graphic image of a vast frenzy of research comes from a corporate adviser quoted as describing China as a "boiling cauldron of people just trying stuff". The headline facts are certainly impressive: One key factor identified in the report is the extraordinary size of spending on RandD - about $163bn last year, an amazing 18% increase on the previous year with further rises planned, with science seen as a central element of China's long-term strategy for growth. Measured by the number of patents applied for and secured, China is booming. By 2020, it could be producing more graduates than the US and EU combined. And by the same year, it may be publishing more scientific papers than the US. But of course quantity does not mean quality. The study also notes a recent estimate that only 10% of Chinese engineering graduates meet international standards of employability. So is China really a world leader in science or still a sweatshop? Or a bit of both? The answer is complicated, according to the report. The image of China as a science superpower may be accurate but it is only one of several different ways to view the country: The authors themselves argue that China should be seen as "an absorptive state", assimilating foreign technologies but then adding value and novelty to them. But what about the risks? The report acknowledges a darker side - the fears among hi-tech companies about the theft of their intellectual property. One business leader said "we don't feel ready yet to develop our 'crown jewels' IP in China". But he nevertheless supports long-term engagement there. A related threat is cybercrime - estimated, in a study for the Cabinet Office, to cost the UK £27bn a year. But the authors suggest the dangers may be overplayed, and may be of more concern to politicians than business people. Overall, the report concludes, "the greatest risk for companies is of focusing too much on these downsides, and missing out on the enormous opportunities that China presents", and it calls for far closer collaboration. People who've tried partnerships and have had their ideas or technology stolen may regard that perspective as overly rosy. But a new kind of science gold rush is under way in China - and, as in every rush, there are fortunes to be made, and lost. </body>

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>Can too much rumination be dangerous?</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <description>How much better is standing up than sitting?</description>

      <body>Studies have claimed major health benefits for standing for much of the day as opposed to sitting. The difference is marked, explains Michael Mosley. Guess how many hours a day you spend sitting? Fewer than eight? More than 10? A recent survey found that many of us spend up to 12 hours a day sitting on our bottoms looking at computers or watching television. If you throw in the seven hours we spend sleeping then that adds up to a remarkable 19 hours a day being sedentary. Sitting down as much as this is clearly bad for us and some studies suggest that those who sit all day live around two years less than those who are more active. Most of us are guilty of excess sitting. We sit at work, in the car and at home, moving only to shift from one seat to another. Even if you exercise on a regular basis that may not be enough. There is mounting evidence that exercise will not undo the damage done by prolonged sitting. Our technology has made us the most sedentary humans in history. So why is sitting so damaging? One thing it does is change the way our bodies deal with sugar. When you eat, your body breaks down the food into glucose, which is then transported in the blood to other cells. Glucose is an essential fuel but persistently high levels increase your risk of diabetes and heart disease. Your pancreas produces the hormone insulin to help get your glucose levels back down to normal, but how efficiently your body does that is affected by how physically active you are We wanted to see what would happen if we took a group of people who normally spend their day sitting in an office and ask them to spend a few hours a day on their feet instead. Standing while you are working may seem rather odd, but it is a practice with a long tradition. Winston Churchill wrote while working at a special standing desk, as did Ernest Hemingway and Benjamin Franklin. So with Dr John Buckley and a team of researchers from the University of Chester we conducted a simple experiment. We asked 10 people who work at an estate agents to stand for at least three hours a day for a week. Our lucky volunteers had mixed feelings about how they would get on. "It'll be different, but looking forward to it, yes…" "I think my feet might hurt - I'll have to wear sensible shoes…" "The small of my back, it's going to hurt…" "I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to stand up for all that time…[Laughs nervously]" We asked all the volunteers to wear an accelerometer - a movement monitor - to record just how much moving about they were doing. They also wore heart rate monitors and had glucose monitors that measured their blood sugar levels constantly, day and night. The evidence that standing up is good for you goes back to at least the 1950s when a study was done comparing bus conductors (who stand) with bus drivers (who don't). This study, published in the Lancet, showed that the bus conductors had around half the risk of developing heart disease of the bus drivers. Since then prolonged sitting has not only been linked to problems with blood glucose control, but also a sharp reduction in the activity of an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, which breaks down blood fats and makes them available as a fuel to the muscles. This reduction in enzyme activity leads to raised levels of triglycerides and fats in the blood, increasing the risk of heart disease. We had good reason to believe that standing would make a difference to our volunteers, but we were also a little anxious as to how they would get on. This was the first time an experiment like this had been conducted in the UK. Would our volunteers stick to it? They did. One woman with arthritis even found that standing actually improved her symptoms. The Chester researchers took measurements on days when the volunteers stood, and when they sat around. When they looked at the data there were some striking differences. As we had hoped, blood glucose levels fell back to normal levels after a meal far more quickly on the days when the volunteers stood than when they sat. There was also evidence, from the heart rate monitors that they were wearing, that by standing they were burning more calories. "If we look at the heart rates," John Buckley explains, "we can see they are quite a lot higher actually - on average around 10 beats per minute higher and that makes a difference of about 0.7 of a calorie per minute." Now that doesn't sound like much, but it adds up to about 50 calories an hour. If you stand for three hours a day for five days that's around 750 calories burnt. Over the course of a year it would add up to about 30,000 extra calories, or around 8lb of fat. "If you want to put that into activity levels," Dr Buckley says, "then that would be the equivalent of running about 10 marathons a year. Just by standing up three or four hours in your day at work." Dr Buckley thinks that although going out and doing exercise offers many proven benefits, our bodies also need the constant, almost imperceptible increase in muscle activity that standing provides. Simple movement helps us to keep our all-important blood sugar under control. We can't all stand up at work but the researchers believe that even small adjustments, like standing while talking on the phone, going over to talk to a colleague rather than sending an email, or simply taking the stairs, will help. I have, of course, written this article while standing. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>The story behind the hidden number 1,729</title>
      <description>Why is the number 1,729 hidden in Futurama episodes?</description>

      <body>The year 1913 marked the beginning of an extraordinary relationship between an impoverished Indian clerk and a Cambridge don. A century later, their remarkable friendship has left its mark in the strangest of places, namely in Futurama, the animated series from The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and physics graduate David X Cohen. GH Hardy (1877-1947) and Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) were the archetypal odd couple. Hardy, whose parents were both teachers, grew up in a middle-class home in Surrey, England. At the age of two he was writing numbers that reached into the millions, so it was no surprise that he eventually read mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he joined an elite secret society known as the Cambridge Apostles. Ramanujan was born in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. At the age of two he survived a bout of smallpox, but his three younger siblings were less fortunate, each one dying in infancy. Although he was enrolled in a local school, Ramanujan's most valuable education was thanks to a library book, A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure Mathematics by GS Carr, which contained thousands of theorems. He investigated these theorems one by one, relying on a chalk and slate for calculations, using his roughened elbows as erasers. Aged 21, he married Janakiammal, who was just 10 years old. Unable to afford college fees and needing to support his wife, Ramanujan got a job as a clerk. Nevertheless, he continued his interest in mathematics in his spare time, developing novel ideas and proving fresh theorems. Curious about the value of his research, Ramanujan began to write to mathematicians in England in the hope that someone would mentor him, or at least give him feedback. Academics such as MJM Hill, HF Baker and EW Hobson largely ignored Ramanujan's pleas for help, but Hardy was mesmerised by the two packages he received in 1913, which contained a total of 120 theorems. Hardy's reaction veered between "fraud" and so brilliant that it was "scarcely possible to believe". In the end, he concluded that the theorems "must be true, because, if they were not true, no-one would have the imagination to invent them". The British professor made arrangements for the young Indian, still only 26, to visit Cambridge. Hardy took great pride in being the man who had rescued such raw talent and would later call it "the one romantic incident in my life". The resulting partnership gave rise to discoveries in several areas of mathematics and Ramanujan's genius was recognised in 1918 when he was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society. The young Indian savant would later say that many of his theorems were whispered to him in his sleep by Namagiri, an avatar of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi: "While asleep, I had an unusual experience. There was a red screen formed by flowing blood, as it were. I was observing it. Suddenly a hand began to write on the screen. I became all attention. That hand wrote a number of elliptic integrals. They stuck to my mind. As soon as I woke up, I committed them to writing." Ramanujan's career was brilliant, but ended prematurely when he began to suffer from tuberculosis. He returned to India in 1919 and died the following year, aged 32. However, the life of Ramanujan continues to fascinate modern mathematicians, including Dr Ken Keeler, who swapped his job as a researcher to join the writing team behind the science fiction sitcom Futurama. He is actually one of a number of mathematicians who write for The Simpsons and its sister series Futurama. They have retained their love for the subject and they continue to express their passion for numbers by smuggling mathematical references into both series. For example, in order to pay homage to Ramanujan, Keeler has repeatedly inserted 1,729 into Futurama, because this particular number cropped up in a famous conversation between Hardy and Ramanujan. According to Hardy, he visited Ramanujan in a nursing home in 1918: "I remember once going to see him when he was lying ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. 'No,' he replied. 'It is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.'" Their exchange can be unpacked and expressed as follows: 1,729 = 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³ It is rare that a number can be split into two positive cubes, and even rarer that it can be split into two positive cubes in two different ways, and 1,729 is the smallest number that exhibits this property. It is in recognition of Ramanujan's comment that Bender, Futurama's cantankerous robot, has the unit number 1729. The number also appears in an episode titled "The Farnsworth Parabox". The plot involves Futurama characters hopping between multiple universes, and one of them is labelled "Universe 1729". Moreover, the starship Nimbus has the hull registration number BP-1729. This has certainly helped keep Ramanujan's memory alive, but it is probably not the sort of immortality that Hardy had in mind when he wrote: "Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do not. Immortality may be a silly word, but probably a mathematician has the best chance of whatever it may mean." Keeler is proud of his mathematical references in Futurama, and he is philosophical about the many years he spent as a mathematician before becoming a comedy writer: "Everything that happens to us has some effect on us, and I do suppose that the time I spent in grad school made me a better writer. I certainly don't regret it. "For example, I chose Bender's serial number to be 1,729 and I think that reference alone completely justifies my doctorate. "I don't know if my thesis advisor sees it that way though." Simon Singh answered readers' questions on Twitter using #AskSimonSingh. Q: What is the second highest number after 1729 and do these numbers have a name? A: Mathematicians tend to focus on what is the smallest number that is the sum of 2 cubes in 3, 4, 5… ways. So 87539319 is smallest number that is the sum of 2 cubes in 3 ways. In "Bender's Big Score" Fry takes cab #87539319. Q: Can you write about Kaprekar's constant 6174 sometime? I think it's better than 1729! A: Not enough space to explain Kaprekar's constant, but I mention Harshad numbers in my book - Kaprekar invented (?) these too. Q: Why does mathematics scare such a large proportion of the public? A: I have a three-year-old son and can see that counting is not a natural process. Maybe the surprise that anybody ever gets maths? Q: I wouldn't say it is rare for a number to be a sum of two cubes, there are infinitely many such numbers. A: Fair point. Q: What is the next big conjecture to be proven? The Riemann Hypothesis? A: Mathematicians seem to rate The Riemann Hypothesis highly. Not something I would ever write about, as it's too complex for my writing talents. Q: What's the next number after 1729 for positive cubes? A: Not sure, but (as you hint) we can look at (-)ve cubes too. Bender's serial number is 2716057, which is 952³ + (-951)³. Q: I see that #AskSimonSingh is due to take place at 16:30BST. Could you reschedule it for 17:29BST? :) A: This is a very good idea. But it is 17.29 somewhere. Q: I don't have a question. I just want to say I really like you as a human being A: Thanks. I guess that is as opposed to liking me as an alien or an amoeba? Q: Why is the number 1,729 hidden in Futurama episodes? A: Many of the writers were mathematicians, and still love numbers, so this is their way of expressing that love. Q: Without computers, how was Ramanujan able to compute properties like the 1729? A: In a way 1729 spot was not miraculous. Many may know that 12³=1728, or 9³=729. Rest is easy. Except it seems that Ramanujan could do this over and over again. Every number was his personal friend.

      <title>Energy bosses called before MPs</title>
      <description>Bosses from the UK's six biggest energy firms are being called before MPs to give evidence about recent price rises.</description>

      <body>Bosses from the UK's six biggest energy firms have been called to give evidence to MPs about recent price rises. The Energy and Climate Change Committee will quiz the bosses on 29 October. In the past two weeks, three of the "big six" energy firms have announced gas and electricity price rises. Npower's dual-fuel bills will go up by 10.4% on 1 December, SSE will increase prices by 8.2% from 15 November and British Gas's prices are due to rise by 9.2% on 23 November. Analysts expect the others - Scottish Power, E.On and EDF - to follow suit by increasing prices. Scottish Power, which has just been hit with a penalty by regulator Ofgem after sales staff misled customers, said it faced the same cost pressures as competitors and was likely to "move on prices" before the end of the year. The chairman of the committee of MPs, Sir Robert Smith, said: "The committee has today decided to call in the energy bosses in the context of the latest wave of price increases." The committee said the session would examine the "reasons and justification" behind recent price rises, the difference of pricing policies between the firms, and how "the transparency of energy company profits can be improved". The energy companies have argued that the price rises were the result of higher wholesale costs, increased costs in delivering energy to customers' homes, and the effect of the levy charged to companies to fund environmental measures. The recent energy price increases have coincided with considerable political debate about the cost of gas and electricity to households. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But Prime Minister David Cameron has branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan a "con", saying that he does not have control over the worldwide price of gas. Meanwhile, former prime minister Sir John Major has called for a windfall tax on the profits of the UK's top energy firms. </body>

      <body>Scottish Power is to pay customers £8.5m after an investigation by industry regulator Ofgem into its doorstep and telephone selling. Ofgem said customers were misled during sales approaches due to Scottish Power's failure to "adequately train and monitor" staff. Consumers on the "warm home discount" will receive about £50 each. Money will also go to those who were misled. The company has apologised for the errors between 2009 and 2012. "Today's announcement is a clear signal to energy suppliers of the consequences of breaching licence obligations," said Ofgem's senior partner in charge of enforcement Sarah Harrison. Scottish Power will pay £7.5m to the 140,000 customers it has on the government-led "warm home discount scheme" aimed at supporting customers who are likely to be at risk of fuel poverty. It estimates each will receive a payment of about £50. It has also set up a £1m customer compensation fund for customers who believe they have been mis-sold to. Scottish Power said the failings identified had now all been rectified. It stopped doorstep sales in 2011 and has also put in place independent checks on the conduct of its telephone agents. Ofgem said the size of the fine reflected Scottish Power's cooperation during the investigation. "Ofgem's investigation found no evidence of a strategy by Scottish Power to deliberately mis-sell to customers," the energy regulator said in a statement. Scottish Power said it would write to the 336,000 people who could have been affected and could be in line for compensation. "We accept Ofgem's findings and we apologize unreservedly to those customers affected," said Neil Clitheroe, of Scottish Power. "This arose as a result of new regulations which were introduced in 2009. I am sorry to say that we didn't implement these properly at that time. "However, I am pleased that Ofgem has made it clear that they found no evidence of a strategy by Scottish Power to deliberately mis-sell to customers. "Since 2011 we have taken determined steps to resolve the problem: doorstep selling was stopped; and all telephone sales staff are properly trained and monitored." Scottish Power is not the only energy supplier to have been in trouble with the regulator over doorstep selling. In April, Ofgem said that SSE was guilty of management failures that led to "prolonged and extensive" mis-selling through telephone, in-store and doorstep sales. The regulator handed down a record £10.5m fine. Two other investigations - into Npower and E.On, are ongoing. Energy companies no longer sell energy door-to-door, a change that has reduced the number of people switching suppliers in recent times, figures show. Also on Tuesday, new rules from Ofgem came into force preventing energy firms from increasing prices during fixed-term contracts. Firms are also banned from automatically rolling customers on to another fixed-term offer when their current one ends. Ofgem says the changes are aimed at ensuring customers get the best energy deal for them. "Ofgem is going to make it easier for consumers to 'vote with their feet'", said Ofgem chief executive Andrew Wright. The rules are part of a series of reforms, relating to new standards of conduct for energy firms. "Our reforms seek to give consumers the tools they need to find the best energy deal for them," added Mr Wright. The reform follows Ofgem's research showing that even on fixed-term deals, suppliers could still increase prices. </body>

      <title>Hedge fund buys top Royal Mail stake</title>
      <description>The Labour Party criticises the Royal Mail privatisation as a hedge fund becomes the company's biggest investor.</description>

      <body>A UK hedge fund has become the biggest shareholder of Royal Mail after the British government. The Children's Investment Fund (TCI) has bought a 5.8% stake in Royal Mail worth £286m ($462m). TCI is considered to be an activist investor which means it pressures management to make changes. The Labour Party says TCI's investment is a sign that the privatisation is benefiting "big money investors in the City" and not the taxpayer. Royal Mail shares were priced at 330p earlier this month, but have since risen by more than 50%, which has spurred critics who accuse the government of selling off Royal Mail too cheaply. Ian Murray, Labour's Shadow Minister for Trade and Investment said: "David Cameron's Royal Mail fire sale has seen the vast majority of shares going to big money investors in the City while the taxpayer is left short changed." Labour Peer Lord Sugar, perhaps best known for his role in the BBC1 series The Apprentice, become the latest critical voice, when he questioned government business spokesman Lord Popat in parliament. He questioned the advice of UBS, Lazards and Goldman Sachs who advised the government over the price and timing of the sale. "Bearing in mind other reputable banks had come on record giving a valuation of £5bn, why were these banks ignored and what will you be doing by way of an inquiry in finding out who the lucky institutions were that underwrote this bargain basement sale?" Lord Sugar said. Lord Popat said that the government had been focused on securing "value for the taxpayer". He also said that the banks who helped with the sale of the Royal Mail could receive up to £18.4m in fees. </body>

      <title>Co-op chair Len Wardle to step down</title>
      <description>The chairman of the Co-operative Group, Len Wardle, is to step down in May after six years in the role, on the day MPs criticise the former management for "shortcomings".</description>

      <body>The chairman of the Co-operative Group, Len Wardle, is to step down in May. Mr Wardle said he had informed the board in August of his decision. "The Co-operative Group is at its best when it is reforming and I want this change to continue," he said in a statement. On Monday, the mutual group said it would lose overall control of the Co-op Bank following a restructuring of a rescue deal, which will provide the bank with extra capital. The change means the group will end up holding just a 30% stake in the bank. Under its original plan it would have held a 70% stake. Mr Wardle's move comes just hours after the former chief executive of the Co-op Group, Peter Marks, appeared at the Treasury Committee of MPs to explain its decision to try to purchase 632 Lloyds bank branches. Co-op Bank pulled out of the deal in April, which is when its financial problems came to light. Speaking about the hearing, the chairman of the Treasury Committee, Andrew Tyrie, criticised the former management for its conduct, saying: "Being owned by a mutual, the Co-op Bank differed from most of its competitors. But on today's evidence, its shortcomings did not." "A lack of personal accountability at senior levels, ineffective corporate governance and insufficient experience and expertise among those taking the decisions. This has become a familiar story." In June, the Co-op Group announced a plan to plug a £1.5bn capital hole in Co-op Bank's balance sheet. The group intended to put in £1bn of capital itself, with £500m coming from bondholders and owners of preference shares. The bank would then have been floated, with Co-op Group holding a 70% share. However, the bank's creditors, led by US hedge funds, rejected the plan. Mr Marks said the mutual group's loss of overall control of the Co-op Bank was "a tragedy". However, he added that the plan to buy the bank branches from Lloyds had offered a "great opportunity". "The bank was sub-scale, it needed to build scale to compete and survive. Verde [the Lloyds branches] created a great opportunity to do that and bring in significant capital and a high quality chief executive," he said. Speaking about his departure, Mr Wardle, who chaired the group for six years, said he was "immensely proud" of his time there. "During the last year, we have appointed Euan Sutherland as group chief executive officer and started the changes that I believe will make The Co-operative Group stronger than ever," he added. Mr Sutherland said Mr Wardle's guidance meant the group had "made significant progress on beginning the reform which we will announce as planned in May 2014". </body>

      <title>Apple shows off thinner iPad Air</title>
      <description>Apple shows off a new thinner top-of-the range iPad, which it says is lighter than any other full-sized tablet on the market.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24629711</url>
      <date>1382470481</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70645000/png/_70645910_air.png</thumbnail>
      <body>Apple has unveiled a top-of-the-range tablet called the iPad Air that is 20% thinner than the previous version. The 9.7in (24.6cm) computer is 7.5mm (0.3in) thick and weighs 1lb (469g), which the firm claims is the lightest full-sized tablet on the market. It is powered by the same A7 chip found in the company's iPhone 5S. The launch comes at a time when some analysts have suggested that Google's Android is about to overtake Apple's iOS as the bestselling tablet platform. Apple also announced a new version of its iPad Mini. Its 7.9in (20cm) screen has been upgraded to feature 2048 by 1536 pixels - the same as the larger model. It is being branded as "retina" to highlight the increased resolution. Amazon and Google have already announced small tablets - the Kindle Fire HDX and Nexus 7 - with similar high definition displays. "We've got the retina upgrade to the smaller iPad that many thought should have been there in the first place," Tony Cripps, principal analyst at tech consultants Ovum, reflected after the announcement in San Francisco. "Market share slip is inevitable because so many rival devices are coming out, which is not necessarily a bad thing as the overall sector is growing. "Apple does now have a cheaper model thanks to it offering the original iPad Mini at a lower price - but the firm doesn't really want to go to the low-end because that's not where the greatest profit is extracted." Apple also announced that the latest version of its Mac operating system, Mavericks, would be offered at no cost to owners of any compatible computer. It is the first time the company has not charged for a major Mac OS upgrade. By contrast the full version of Windows 8.1 is sold for about £100, although it is free to existing Windows 8 users. Linux-based Ubuntu has always been offered without charge. New laptops, productivity and leisure apps were also unveiled. However, Apple did not show off a new TV set-top box as some had speculated. The California-based firm's most recent financial release said that its iPad range accounted for $25.8bn (£17.6bn) worth of sales in the nine months leading up to July. That represented 19% of its revenue for the period. However, Apple acknowledged that the amount of money it was making from the product line was growing three times slower than the growth in unit sales since many customers were opting for its cheaper iPad Mini and iPad 2 models rather than its top-of-the -range "retina display" versions. It also faces the fact it is losing market share to rivals. Apple's iOS operating system accounted for 53.9% of all tablets shipped in 2012, according to Gartner. The tech research firm forecasts that Android will become the market leader with a 49.6% share, versus Apple's 48.6% this year, adding that it expects that gap to widen further in 2014. However, consultants at IHS iSuppli said those figures needed to be put in context thanks to Apple's success at making money by taking a cut of app sales. "It is in terms of revenue per active device where Apple's lead is strongest," said the firm's mobile media analyst Jack Kent. "An iOS device generates around three to four times as much app revenue through Apple's App Store as an Android device through Google Play. "Apple has so far offered a more compelling range of tablet-specific content, but Google is clearly looking to address this." He added that many Android tablets, including Amazon's Kindle and most products sold in China, did not have Google's store pre-installed. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook noted there were now 475,000 apps designed for iPads available through its online marketplace. But another market watcher suggested that Apple's priority remained securing a "premium" margin on the shop price of its hardware, and that add-on software sales were of secondary interest. "Some players, like Amazon, can afford to slash prices because they have a different business model based on content and commerce," said Thomas Husson, from the tech industry analysts Forrester. "While Apple has shared $13bn to developers since 2008, it has made less than $6bn out of apps. "It's a huge stat, but low in comparison with Apple's quarterly results." </body>

      <title>Asda backs down on mobile credits</title>
      <description>Asda has agreed to compensate pay-as-you-go mobile phone customers who will lose credit when it changes provider</description>

      <body>Asda will reimburse pre-payment mobile phone customers who were due to lose out when it changes provider. Tens of thousands of its pay-as-you-go mobile customers had been told they had to use all their call credits by the end of April or they would lose them. The supermarket is moving the network from Vodafone to EE. After BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme raised the issue, Asda said they would offer customers free credit to use on its new mobile service or a gift card. Until this week, the Asda website told customers they must use their credits because they could not transfer them, without offering any reimbursement. It said: "We aren't able to transfer any credit, so we'd suggest you run down your current credit before joining us on the new network." Asda customer Lorna uses her pay-as-you-go phone only occasionally, for urgent calls. She has £66 credit, which she did not think she could afford to lose. When she first heard of the change, she called Asda to see if she could get a voucher for the unused credit. She told Money Box: "They said basically you've got to use it or lose it, and it's such a lot of money for me to lose. "I know they've given us time to try and use it, but when you're being frugal, you just can't waste money like that." Moyra also emailed to complain to Money Box. "It is their decision to move to EE so why should I lose my credit because of their decision?" she asked Neil tweeted Money Box to say his son stood to lose £20. Adam Samuel, a financial services compliance lawyer, said that customers may have been able to claim that they had been subject to an unfair contract term. He said: "The term in question doesn't appear to have been prominently presented when Asda sold either the original service or, more importantly, the top-ups that it almost certainly has sold with it. "So people have bought their top-ups not realising that there was any time limit on their use and this is just a simple piece of unfairness." Mr Samuel said many customers would have used up the minutes anyway by the deadline but some people would have been disadvantaged He said: "For the elderly who don't use their mobile phones that much, this could be a real imposition to say you know you must make lots of calls within a set period of time." Asda has now added advice on its website, after Money Box highlighted customer complaints. It now reads: "If you still have credit remaining on our current service at 30 April 2014, don't worry we'll provide you with a refund in either free credit to use on the new Asda Mobile service or an Asda Gift Card to spend on anything you like. When the programme telephoned Lorna to tell her the news, she said she was "delighted". Asda told Money Box: "We made a commitment last week that that we'd work closely with customers to make sure they wouldn't end up out of pocket and that is still the case. "We do agree that this information wasn't clear enough for our customers on our website so we've updated this. "Any customers who have a balance as of 30 April will be provided with a credit voucher to use on the new network or an Asda gift card." Money Box is broadcast on Saturdays at 12:00 BST on BBC Radio 4 and repeated on Sundays at 21:00 BST. You can listen again via the BBC iPlayer or by downloading Money Box podcast. </body>

      <title>US added 148,000 jobs in September</title>
      <description>The US economy added a lower-than-expected 148,000 jobs in September, official figures show, but the unemployment rate fell to 7.2%.</description>

      <body>The US economy added 148,000 jobs in September, official figures show, lower than analysts had predicted. The unemployment rate fell to 7.2%, down from 7.3% in August, the US Department of Labor said. The release of the figures was delayed by the partial shutdown of the US government earlier this month. Economists had predicted 180,000 job gains for September, and the lower-than-expected figure could raise fears the US economy is losing momentum. Employment in professional and business services grew at the fastest pace with 32,000 new jobs added. Leisure and hospitality was the only sector to see a fall with 13,000 jobs lost. Carl Leahey, senior adviser at Decision Economics, said the report was "so-so", and meant the US central bank was likely to continue its massive $85bn-a-month economic stimulus programme. "This report will soften people's assessments of current conditions. With the possibility of a replay of the budget showdown as early as mid-January, why would the Fed want to pull any levers now?," he said. Following the figures, stock markets turned higher, with the FTSE 100 up 0.5% at 6,688 and both the Dow futures and broader SandP index futures up 0.3%, as investors bet on the Fed continuing its stimulus programme at the same pace. The dollar fell, under pressure from the expectation that the stimulus programme, which effectively creates more dollars, will continue at the same rate. The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, maintained its economic stimulus programme last month, suggesting it was still uncertain about the strength of the economic recovery. "Today's underperforming jobs number fully justifies September's cautious FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee)," said Joseph Trevisani, chief market strategist at WorldwideMarkets. The Labor Department said the next US unemployment data would be released on 8 November, a week later than scheduled due to the partial shutdown of the US government. Its workers were placed on unpaid leave during the shutdown raising fears the department will struggle to collect accurate data for October. "The October survey will be compromised by the late survey and the unquantifiable indirect private sector job losses triggered by the shutdown, and the November numbers will be compromised by the recovery - we hope - of those same jobs," said Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics. </body>

      <title>Buyer sought for Grangemouth plant</title>
      <description>The Scottish government is trying to find a buyer for the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemicals plant which is at the centre of an industrial dispute.</description>

      <body>The Scottish government is trying to find a buyer for the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemicals plant. Scotland's Finance Secretary John Swinney said ministers had been having discussions "with other players". An ongoing dispute between owners Ineos and the union Unite has resulted in the plant being temporarily closed. Ineos has said it will make an announcement to workers on Wednesday on the future of the complex. UK ministers have held talks with Scottish ministers to discuss the situation. They urged both sides to get round the negotiating table. Grangemouth plays an important part in bringing ashore North Sea oil and supplies petrol and diesel to the whole of Scotland and the north of England. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Swinney said: "I don't think it will come as any surprise to anyone that the government is looking for alternative options and there certainly will be other players around the globe interested in this particular plant. "We have certainly had discussions with other players and the Scottish government will engage in any discussions that are helpful to ensure Grangemouth can continue to make a major contribution to the health and well-being of the Scottish economy." He added that government ownership was "not appropriate" and that there was a "buyer out there". Scottish Energy Minister Fergus Ewing joined talks by telephone on Tuesday afternoon with Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael and UK Energy Minister Michael Fallon. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Newsdrive programme, Mr Carmichael said: "There is a real imperative for them [Ineos and Unite] - not just for the future of the Grangemouth plant, but for the wider Scottish economy - to get back to the table, to get talking, to explore the issues that require to be explored in good faith and with a view to getting the plant operational as soon as possible. "Frankly nothing else is as important as that at the moment." The Scottish secretary also said both governments were making "contingency plans" for the Grangemouth site, if the owners decide not to reopen it. Senior figures from Ineos met in London earlier to discuss the outcome of their challenge to the workforce to accept reduced pay and pension. Responding to Mr Swinney's comments on talks about a takeover of the site, Declan Sealy, a director for Ineos at Grangemouth, said: "Like every business, we look at buying and selling assets and businesses all the time. "Our focus here today is on trying to implement a survival plan that brings a future for Grangemouth." However, it is not thought there has been any discussion with Ineos of a sale or a different operator. Unite said it would support the Scottish government in whatever way it could "to ensure a secure future for Grangemouth and its working community". The union's Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, said Mr Swinney's intervention was a "welcome" one. He added: "This site is so key to the Scottish economy, so key to the UK economy, it cannot be treated the way it is being treated. "It cannot be used in a Russian roulette type of way of 'we get what we want or we close this site down'. It is just so irresponsible and that type of behaviour cannot be tolerated. "This site cannot close, that's not an option and it does have a future, a really good, bright future." Unite said half of the 1,350-strong workforce had rejected Ineos' proposed change to contracts. The company gave employees until 18:00 on Monday to accept plans, including a pay freeze and downgrading of pensions. The union said the refusal of the workforce to accept the new contract terms was a mandate to return to talks and fire up the plant. It was shut down last week by Ineos in response to a strike threat over the disciplining of a union representative at the complex. Ineos had said the plant would close without new investment and changes to workers' terms and conditions. The firm said it would communicate the shareholders' views directly to the workforce on Wednesday. However, Ineos has warned a decision on the plant's fate could take several days. A spokesman added: "Ineos is now considering the numbers of employees that have given their support to its survival plan. "Consultations on the survival plan formally began last Thursday. It will take 45 days before any changes to terms and conditions can be introduced and 60 days before any changes to pensions can be implemented." Majority shareholder Jim Ratcliffe has said if the petro-chemical plant goes, the neighbouring refinery is unlikely to survive. He has also said Ineos may not be willing to pay the cost of a prolonged shutdown. Finance Secretary Mr Swinney repeated the Scottish government's calls for the firm to "fire up the plant" and urged both sides to avoid "the clear danger of a stalemate". He added: "The trade union has given, in my estimation, a very clear and unequivocal commitment that there will be no industrial action this side of Christmas, and indeed last night the union said there would be no strike action well into 2014. "I think we should take these commitments at face value, accept them, and get the plant operating again." The refinery, which has an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes, provides most of the fuel in Scotland, Northern England and Northern Ireland. The petrochemicals facility at the site manufactures more than two million tonnes of chemical products per year, which are later transformed into essential items such as bottles and pipes, cabling and insulation and food packaging. </body>

      <body>More than a million complaints about payment protection insurance (PPI) have been made to the financial ombudsman, latest figures show. Cases end up with the ombudsman if there is no agreement between a bank and its customer. In the third quarter of the year, 81% of all complaints made to the ombudsman were about PPI. Banks said that complaint numbers were starting to fall and institutions were improving how these were handled. PPI policies are supposed to repay people's loans if their income drops because they fall ill or lose their jobs. Some people have benefited from the policies, but many were unaware they were even paying for it. Others did not need it or would have been unable to make a claim. Thousands of people have already been compensated after being mis-sold the policies, and now a huge industry has built up around sorting all the claims that can be made. Consumer groups regard PPI as the UK's biggest financial mis-selling scandal. The ombudsman has said that some customers were facing "unnecessary delays" in receiving compensation payouts. Since April, 247,399 complaints have been made to the ombudsman about PPI. Some 70% of PPI disputes dealt with by the ombudsman in the same time period have been resolved in favour of consumers. The latest figures show that more than a million complaints have now been made to the ombudsman. About two-thirds of these have come in the last 18 months. However, a spokesman for the British Bankers' Association (BBA), which represents the High Street banks, said: "Figures published by the Financial Conduct Authority last week showed that customer complaints have fallen by 17% this year. "Banks are determined that there will be no repeat of any of the bad practices which caused mis-selling in the past and have overhauled incentive structures. Staff are now rewarded for high levels of customer service and not sales volumes. The industry continues to work with the FCA and the ombudsman to improve complaint handling for customers." </body>

      <description>Government borrowing fell in September, official figures show, helped by higher tax revenues.</description>

      <body>Government borrowing fell in September, official figures show, helped by higher tax revenues. Public sector net borrowing, excluding the cost of interventions such as bank bailouts, was £11.1bn, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The figure is lower than the £12.1bn recorded in September 2012. The UK's net public debt pile stands at £1.21 trillion, which is equivalent to 75.9% of GDP. The government is aiming for a deficit of no more than £120bn this year, excluding the effect of cash transfers from Royal Mail and the Bank of England. For the first half of the current tax year, the deficit on this measure totalled £56.7bn, down more than 9% compared with the same period a year previously. Total cash receipts between April and September rose to £265.3bn, up from £237bn a year earlier. Efforts to reduce UK borrowing and cut the country's debts are central to the government's economic policies. Chancellor George Osborne has said that a re-elected Conservative government would aim to wipe out Britain's budget deficit altogether by 2020. Speaking at at a Thomson Reuters event, Mr Osborne warned the UK's problems weren't over. "An improving economic situation in the UK does not automatically lead to a windfall for the public finances... we are going to go on as a government having to take very difficult decisions to control public spending and make sure we are on top of the deficit." Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the figures put the government on track for the full year. "The hope is that the trend in the public finances will increasingly improve over the coming months as improved economic activity increasingly feeds through to boost tax revenues and help limit benefit payments," he added. However, Chris Leslie MP, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government's deficit plan was "way off track". "Three years of flatlining growth and falling living standards mean George Osborne is set to break his promise to balance the books by 2015. He's forecast to borrow over £200bn more than planned simply to pay for the costs of his economic failure." </body>

      <title>Ex-Co-op boss: Bank move 'a tragedy'</title>
      <description>The former chief executive of the Co-op Group says the mutual firm's loss of overall control of the Co-op Bank was "a tragedy", while MPs criticise its former management.</description>

      <body>The former chief executive of the Co-op Group has said the mutual group's loss of overall control of the Co-op Bank is "a tragedy". However, Peter Marks, who left the group this year, said it could also be seen as a "good thing". "It will force the Co-op to focus on less businesses and not stretch its capital in the way that it has been," he added. Mr Marks was being questioned by the Treasury Committee of MPs. The hearing was over the purchase of 632 Lloyds bank branches, which Co-op Bank pulled out of in April. On Monday, the Co-op Group said a restructuring of its rescue deal for Co-op Bank, which will provide it with extra capital, meant it would end up holding just a 30% stake in the bank. Under its original plan it would have held a 70% stake. "How many businesses try to be major bank, major pharmacy, major food retailer, major funeral director?" asked Mr Marks. He said he had warned that the Co-op Group should focus on fewer businesses, but the group's structure meant that he did not have the power to change this during his six years at the helm. "Being a chief executive of a co-operative is very different to being a chief executive of a PLC. I don't believe I could have changed the governance structure," he said. However, Mr Marks said the plan to buy the bank branches from Lloyds had offered a "great opportunity". "The bank was sub-scale, it needed to build scale to compete and survive. Verde [the Lloyds branches] created a great opportunity to do that and bring in significant capital and a high quality chief executive," he said. Speaking about the hearing, the chairman of the Treasury Committee, Andrew Tyrie, criticised the former management for its conduct, saying: "Being owned by a mutual, the Co-op Bank differed from most of its competitors. But on today's evidence, its shortcomings did not." "A lack of personal accountability at senior levels, ineffective corporate governance and insufficient experience and expertise among those taking the decisions. This has become a familiar story." The Co-op Bank's financial problems came to light after the bank pulled out of the deal to buy Lloyds' branches. In June, the Co-op announced it had reached an agreement with the bank regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority, to plug a £1.5bn capital hole in its balance sheet. This would have seen Co-op Group put in £1bn of capital itself, with £500m coming from bondholders and owners of preference shares. The bank would then have been floated, with Co-op Group holding a 70% share. However, the bank's creditors, led by US hedge funds, rejected the plan. </body>

      <title>Nokia reveals phablets and tablets</title>
      <description>Two Windows Phone phablets and a Windows RT tablet are among the final devices unveiled by Nokia ahead of the sale of its hardware unit to Microsoft.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24608498</url>

      <body>Nokia has unveiled its first phablets - extra-large phones - as well as its first tablet computer. The Windows Phone handsets introduce the ability to change which objects in a photo are in focus after it is taken. The Windows RT tablet has a 4G data chip, unlike Microsoft's recently unveiled Surface 2. Nokia World in Abu Dhabi is likely to be remembered as the Finnish firm's last major event before it completes the sale of its hardware unit. Microsoft agreed to buy the business for 5.4bn euros ($7.4bn; £4.6bn) in a deal which the companies have said should be finalised by early 2014. Nokia's former chief executive Stephen Elop, who resigned to become head of the company's devices and services division until his transfer to Microsoft, admitted to the BBC that choosing Windows Phone rather than Android as an operating system had presented the company with "a very difficult challenge." "It's been hard. It's a very difficult challenge; it's a very competitive environment, but we're pleased with the fact that we're building momentum," he said. One analyst said the sale should aid the US firm's efforts to promote its mobile platforms against the market leaders, Google Android and Apple iOS. "For the last two years Microsoft and Nokia's marketing efforts have jarred against each other at times - having one big effort should be better than two smaller ones," said Martin Garner, from the consultancy CCS Insight. "Microsoft can also spend a lot more marketing the devices than Nokia could. That does seem to be a key criteria - both Samsung and Apple's spends are very high indeed." Microsoft's share of the handset and tablet markets is growing but from a relatively low level, according to market research firm Gartner. Windows Phone took a 3.3% share of smartphone sales in the April-to-June quarter, said the firm, with Nokia proving the most popular brand. It also forecast that about 1.7% of all tablets shipped over 2013 as a whole would be powered by either Windows RT or the full Windows 8 operating system. Nokia showed off two phablets at the UAE launch. Both the Lumia 1520 and Lumia 1320 feature 6in (15.2cm) displays, allowing extra rows of apps to be displayed on their home screens than possible on smaller models. The firm said that the extra space would also make it easier to use the phones' touchscreen keyboards, suggesting this would appeal to business users who used productivity software. A new Beamer app will allow the phones to stream the contents of their screens onto to a web browser on a separate display. It works by sending data via Nokia's computer servers. Another new app - Refocus - lets owners determine which parts of a photograph are in focus and which are blurred after it is taken. The phones achieve this by taking a series of images in quick succession at different focus lengths rather than replicating the light field effect captured by a Lytro camera. Blackberry is among the other companies to have recently launched a phablet, but one expert said doubts about the Canadian firm's future meant that its existing users might be tempted to switch. "There's definitely a chance for Nokia to gain ground, of course everyone else is interested in that space too," said Mr Garner. "It's not a slam dunk, but Microsoft is as well placed as others - better in some respects." The Lumia 2520 becomes the only Windows RT tablet made by a manufacturer other than Microsoft. Dell, Asus, Lenovo, Acer and Samsung had all initially backed the platform only to later change tack. The operating system runs on an ARM-based chip allowing it to offer superior battery life to the full Windows 8 system running on tablets powered by x86 processors, but it does not support as many programs. Nokia's tablet is slightly more compact than Microsoft's version and also distinguishes itself by supporting an optional 4G Sim card. However, bearing in mind Microsoft has already taken a $900m writedown after weak sales of its original Surface RT tablet, one analyst questioned whether the firm would want to produce two competing models. "I don't think that having two devices in that space makes a lot of sense," said Carolina Milanesi, consumer devices analyst at Gartner. "I believe Microsoft may keep the Nokia model on as a cheaper consumer-targeted device focused on media consumption and gaming in order to capture more market share, and also keep on the more expensive Intel-based Surface Pro - but it will phase out the Surface 2 RT model." Nokia also added three models to its Asha range of low-end handsets targeted at emerging markets and shoppers on a budget. They run Nokia's proprietary Series 40 OS rather than Windows Phone. The most expensive of the devices, the Asha 530, now supports 3G data in addition to 2G, allowing faster internet access. "It's important for Nokia and Microsoft to connect the next billion people," said Mr Elop, suggesting that Microsoft would find Asha's popularity a convenient way to promote other services such as its Skydrive cloud storage product. But one market watcher questioned Asha's future. "There's still quite a lot of demand for Asha in developing markets where the phones offer brand-value against other low-cost mass-market handsets," said Chris Green from the Davies Murphy Group consultancy. "So, there's no sense to killing the business while it remains highly profitable. "But will it be a core focus? Absolutely not. It will be a distraction and Microsoft will be keen to migrate users to the Windows Phone platform." </body>

      <title>Cuba to scrap two-currency system</title>

      <body>Cuba is to scrap its two-currency system in the latest financial reform rolled out by President Raul Castro, official media report. Since 1994 Cuba has had two currencies, one pegged to the US dollar and the other worth only a fraction of that. The more valuable convertible peso (CUC) was reserved for use in the tourism sector and foreign trade. Now its value will be gradually unified with the lower-value CUP, ending a system resented by ordinary Cubans. The Cuban economy is almost entirely state-run and the tourism sector has boomed since the collapse of the Soviet Union plunged Cuba into economic isolation and hardship. The two-currency system was supposed to protect Cuba's fragile economy but angered locals paid in the much lower-value CUP and denied access to goods only available for those with convertible pesos. The policy exacerbated the creation of a two-tier class system in Cuba which divided privileged Cubans with access to the lucrative tourist and foreign-trade sectors from those working in the local economy - all-too-visibly contradicting Cuba's supposedly egalitarian society. The council of ministers has approved a timetable for implementing "measures that will lead to monetary and exchange unification", the official Communist Party newspaper Granma said. Unification is "imperative to guarantee the re-establishment of the Cuban peso's value and its role as money, that is as a unit of accounting, means of payment and savings", it said. It gave no details of how quickly the change would be implemented, though Reuters news agency quoted Cuban economists as saying it would take about 18 months. </body>

      <title>Muted start for bank switching plan</title>

      <body>The number of consumers changing current account provider has hardly changed pace during the first weeks of a new bank switching service. Some 89,000 people switched in the first four weeks of operation of the multi-million pound service. Although this was up 11% on the same period last year, the figure is little different from the four-week average seen over the previous 12 months. It is argued that banks have done more to try to keep current customers. Under the new Switch Guarantee, Britain's 46 million current account holders should be able to move their bank account to another provider within seven days. After a customer has switched their account, a new redirection service automatically transfers any payments accidentally made to a customer's old account to their new account for 13 months. "We never expected that every customer who is tempted to switch would rush out to do so at launch, but this is an encouraging start," said Adrian Kamellard, chief executive of the Payments Council, which is overseeing the new service. "This service is all about customers and the focus continues to be on them. Across the entire industry huge amounts of work continues to be put in to ensure that customers get the commitments made in the guarantee. "It is by getting this right that we can deliver on the objectives of increasing competition and providing greater choice for customers." Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which?, said: "These early figures are a positive sign that more consumers might be voting with their feet when they are dissatisfied with their bank, but suggest that the new process alone will fail to transform switching rates and significantly increase competition in banking. "Banks must make it simple for people to compare the cost of running a current account so they can be confident in their choices and give customers a reason to switch by offering better products and customer service." </body>

      <body>French utility firm GDF Suez has signed a deal with UK-based Dart Energy to explore Cheshire and the East Midlands for shale gas. GDF Suez will buy a 25% share in Dart's 13 onshore licences for £7.4m ($12m), followed by £16.7m for ongoing costs. The licences overlay the Bowland Shale area, estimated to contain 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas. The company said several wells will be drilled in the 1,378 sq km (532 sq miles) area, if the government allows. The French group said that, alongside Dart Energy, it planned to drill "a number of exploration wells" initially. Jean-Marie Dauger, chief executive of GDF Suez, said: "We are very confident about the potential of shale gas in the UK, and its anticipated contributions to UK energy security." He said the deal marked the company's first investment in UK shale gas. Mr Dauger added: "We look forward to working with our partner, Dart Energy, to unlock the potential of these licences." The deal is expected to be completed by the end of 2013. </body>

      <title>British Gas Twitter move draws ire</title>
      <description>An attempt by British Gas to engage its customers in a question and answer session on Twitter ended up attracting a riot of opinion that included black humour and rage.</description>

      <body>It surely seemed like a good way to present a human face to customers. On the day it announced prices would rise by 9.2%, British Gas decided to take to the micro-blogging site Twitter to conduct a QandA with its public. But the hashtag #AskBG instead ended up crowd-sourcing a riot of opinion that included black humour and rage. This one was straight to the point: "Social media car crash: British Gas hike energy bills by £123 and then ask Twitter what it thinks." Others were even more blunt: "I've been a loyal customer for a few years. How will you feel when pensioners die from choosing to eat instead of heat???" The session started civilly enough with a simple announcement that British Gas's customer services director would be available for questions. Among the few conventional questions was this: Claire asked: "@BritishGas I can barely make current payments to you. My income is v.low. Can you assist me, or shld I switch?" This was one of the minority of posts British Gas could give a simple answer to: "Hi Claire, if you are worried about rising energy costs please call us 0800 980 1917 or visit http://britishgas.co.uk/warmhomes." Such questions though were swamped by those expressing worry about their bills, or venting their anger at the cost of energy, with typical comments on the plight of pensioners and alternative fuels, such as £10 notes. British Gas sent out a statement after the session had closed: "Our announcement today is difficult news for customers. We didn't make this decision lightly. We know people are worried about rising energy prices and they want to talk about this - including on Twitter - and it's important we're there for them to talk to" It said the QandA was the "right thing to do". </body>

      <title>Npower to raise prices by 10.4%</title>
      <description>Energy firm Npower is the latest supplier to announce price rises, with a dual-fuel bill to go up 10.4% from 1 December.</description>

      <body>Energy firm Npower has become the third major supplier to announce price rises, with a dual-fuel bill to go up 10.4%. The price rise will take effect on 1 December, and is the highest increase announced by any supplier so far. SSE will increase prices by 8.2% from 15 November and British Gas said prices would go up by 9.2% on 23 November. The Npower increase includes an electricity price rise of 9.3% and a gas price rise of 11.1%. The move will affect 3.1 million customers. The change will add an extra £137 to an annual average dual-fuel bill, taking it to £1,459. Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. "I know that any increases to household bills are always unwelcome, and this is not a decision that we have taken lightly. We will continue to take steps where we can to reduce the impact of the external influences on energy bills," said Paul Massara, chief executive of Npower. Npower echoed the view of the other suppliers by saying that the rise was the result of cost increases in delivering energy to homes, fulfilling government schemes and raw materials. The company said that it "aimed" to make a profit of five pence in the pound, which it regarded as a "fair return" for delivering energy reliably to people's homes and for the risks it has to take on. Clare Francis, of price comparison website Moneysupermarket, said she expected the other major suppliers to follow suit with price rises. "The domino effect has really kicked in," she said. But Npower said that all suppliers faced the same pressures on costs, so there was a "natural tendency" for prices to move at the same time. "When Tesco puts up the price of a loaf of bread by 5p no-one is surprised if Sainsbury's do the same because they are subject to the same costs. We are clear that the market is competitive," the company said. It also challenged the view that prices shot up when wholesale costs went up but fell slowly after wholesale costs dropped. Yet, Stephen Fitzpatrick, the founder of Ovo Energy, said that he had not seen any rises in wholesale prices recently. The company, one of the smallest energy suppliers in the UK, put up prices earlier in the year. The energy price increases have coincided with considerable political debate about the cost to households. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But Prime Minister David Cameron branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. Mr Massara, of Npower, said that the Labour proposal was "superficially attractive", but it would not lead to lower sustainable prices. "It doesn't cut the growing costs of supplying energy. Only 16% of the bill is under our control and imposing price controls discourages investment, increases uncertainty and ultimately leads to higher prices," he said. The latest price rise comes on the day the government has given the go-ahead for the UK's first new nuclear station in a generation. There are fears from one consumer group that energy bills could go up, as the owners of the nuclear plant are being guaranteed a price for electricity. "Rising energy bills are one of the top concerns for cash-strapped consumers, so everyone will want to be assured that the price the government has agreed for new nuclear power is fair," said Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which?. France's EDF Energy will lead a consortium, which includes Chinese investors, to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Ministers say the deal will help take the UK towards low-carbon power and lower generating costs in the future. Consumer groups, including watchdog Consumer Futures, are calling for reviews to look at the structure of the energy market, and to consider the costs and benefits of government policy. </body>

      <title>Taxman takes on 'pension liberators'</title>

      <body>The UK's tax authority is stepping up its scrutiny of pension funds amid concerns over people being enticed into cashing in their pension early. Pension liberation schemes encourage people to access their pension savings before the age of 55. These schemes will no longer be automatically registered to receive funds when an online form is received by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Now the details will be scrutinised before they can operate. "The changes to our process are part of a government-wide initiative involving HMRC and other agencies aiming to detect, disrupt and deter promoters of pension liberation schemes and to ensure that individuals are aware of the true tax position," a spokesman for the tax authority said. "The vast majority of pension funds abide by their legal obligations but we won't hesitate to de-register a pension scheme where rules are not adhered to." Up to 70% of any funds released from a pension early can go to the tax authority. This is because pension saving is tax privileged, under the proviso that the funds are not touched until the saver reaches the age of 55 at least. These liberation scheme operators can also charge high fees, often between 10% and 20% of the amount "released". The operators of pension liberation schemes tend to work in the grey areas of the law, according to the regulator. Introducers to the schemes, or advisers, use text messages, cold calls, or website promotions to encourage people to access their "frozen" pension. They might suggest that people take a loan from the scheme provider, secured on their pension funds. Alternatively, the money might be transferred from the pension scheme into risky, unregulated investments often based overseas, the Pensions Regulator said. </body>

      <title>Credit union offering 'payday loans'</title>
      <description>A credit union says that more than 6,000 customers have now successfully applied online for its payday-style loans.</description>

      <body>A credit union says that more than 6,000 customers have now successfully applied online for its payday-style loans. London Mutual offers people the chance to borrow between £100 and £1,000 at an interest rate of 2% per month. Borrowers do not have to save with the credit union to apply but they must live or work within one of four inner-London boroughs. Other UK credit unions are expected to adopt a similar model next year. The loans are available on the London Mutual Credit Union's CUOK website. Credit unions are currently limited to charging no more than 2% interest per month, so to borrow £400 over a month would cost just £8 in interest. Customers who want the payment on the same day as they apply have to pay an £11 fee. Borrowers must live or work within four London boroughs - Westminster, Camden, Southwark or Lambeth. They also have to undertake a short psychometric test as part of the application process. The five questions ask borrowers if they tend to obey rules and worry about what other people think of them. Lakshman Chandrasekera, London Mutual Credit Union's chief executive, said the test helped them make lending decisions: "We are trying to find out if you are the type of person who will borrow and not care about not paying. It is useful. There's a correlation between what they say and what their payment patterns are." The whole application process can be finished in under 10 minutes. Mr Chandrasekera said that applicants were given a fast service: "Our online payday loan facility is exactly the same as any other payday loan service. People can apply for the loan, get the decision there and then, and then get the money within a couple of hours." However, the cost of borrowing is significantly lower than commercial payday lenders. Many would charge more than £100 to borrow £400 for a month. Mr Chandrasekera said his credit union also makes careful checks to ensure customers will not struggle to repay the loan: "We are doing thorough checks on affordability, so we will make sure this person can afford to pay the loan." Emma took out a loan for £100 with CUOK last month in order to buy her children school uniforms which she has agreed to pay back over a three month period, costing her just £4.04 in interest: "I'd overspent on holiday with the children. We went through what I had coming in and they worked out what I could afford to pay back. I think within 24 hours I had the money. It was very easy, very straightforward." London Mutual admitted that only one in five applicants like Emma can be approved solely on the basis of the online application process. The other four out of five applicants normally then have to speak to someone over the phone to give additional information. But they would still hope to process the application within 24 hours. Michael regularly used payday loan firms until he discovered he could borrow £400 from CUOK: "Payday loan companies are so aggressive. They also charge about 10 times as much as a credit union. I didn't have to stress." Mark Lyonette, chief executive of the Association of British Credit Unions, says it is important his members speed up their processing of loans but they should still not be too short term: "The sector has just introduced an automated scoring system built on a score card working with the credit reference agencies. We might not be keen on making loans for a 10-day period but we absolutely need to not take 10 days to make a loan." Some industry commentators believe there are strict limits to the extent that credit unions could ever compete with payday lenders. Julian Knight, money editor of the Independent newspaper, says payday lending has grown too big: "They just don't have the scale. The payday lending industry is worth £3bn to £4bn. It would just be a scratch on the surface." Money Box is broadcast on Saturdays at 12:00 BST on BBC Radio 4 and repeated on Sundays at 21:00 BST.

      <body>China's four major cities saw record rise in new home prices in September, stoking fears of a housing bubble. Prices in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou saw their biggest jump since the government changed its calculation method in January 2011. Property remains a popular investment choice in China and prices have now risen for nine months in a row. Analysts say Beijing has so far held back on imposing fresh curbs due to concerns over slowing economic growth. However, data released last week showed that China's growth rate picked up in the July-to-September period - the first rise in three quarters. Many believe that with the economy picking up and property prices continuing to rise, policymakers may soon implement measures to control speculation in the sector and also keep price rises in check. Data released by the by China's National Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday showed that new home prices rose in 69 of China's 70 major cities in September. In the capital city of Beijing, new home prices were 16% higher in September than they were a year earlier. In Shanghai, prices rose by 17% compared to a year earlier. The southern manufacturing-based cities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou saw prices rise by 20%. The eastern city of Wenzhou was the only Chinese city to post a decline. Prices fell by 1.7% from last year. </body>

      <title>UK set to guarantee energy projects</title>
      <description>A string of renewable energy projects are earmarked for possible government backing in an effort to speed up infrastructure schemes.</description>

      <body>A string of renewable energy projects have been earmarked for possible government backing. The private schemes, including a Forth Estuary wind farm and a biomass plant in Bristol are in line for up to £33bn in government guarantees. The Treasury has agreed to step in and underwrite part of the building costs if they cannot get funding elsewhere. Ministers said it would boost growth and jobs, but Labour said their record on infrastructure was "appalling". The Treasury has announced details of 13 energy, transport and education schemes that could get government backing if they do not attract financial backing by other means. The £40bn UK Guarantee Scheme, launched by Chancellor George Osborne last year, is part of ministers' efforts to encourage private sector investment and to boost spending seen as vital to the economy's long-term development. The new projects eligible for potential support are: Should the projects fail to attract commercial funding, the government has agreed to step in to underwrite part or all of the capital spending - charging the contractors a fee for doing so. The government has previously announced that it is prepared to guarantee the proposed £16bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, due to be built by French firm EDF, with support from Chinese investors. The extension of the Northern Line Tube network in London and the Mersey Gateway bridge have also been offered guarantees, in principle, as have 24 other projects whose details have not been released for commercial reasons. Guarantees are not awarded until detailed feasibility and due diligence studies have been completed and contractors are ready to approach financial markets for funding. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the government was the first ever to use the strength of its balance sheet to facilitate infrastructure projects. He defended the number of projects that had been backed so far, saying the mere offer of a guarantee had helped some projects to get alternative sources of funding. "The offer of a guarantee is helping to get projects going," he told the BBC News Channel. "There is a lot of infrastructure happening in this country because of this programme." In 2010, the government pledged to spend £200bn on major infrastructure projects by 2015, with an emphasis on delivering key projects on time and on budget. It has also announced additional spending after 2015. The Institute of Civil Engineers welcomed Tuesday's announcement and said the guarantee scheme had enabled "viable projects to secure finance in difficult market conditions". "It is an excellent example of government making creative use of its resources to get projects moving," said the organisation's director general Nick Baveystock. But Labour said the government had wasted the past three years. The opposition said only one project - the £700m partial conversion of the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire from coal to biomass - had actually taken advantage of the UK Guarantee scheme to date while, in total, work had only begun on one in five of infrastructure projects. "There's lots more that could be done but they just don't seem to have their heart in it," said shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie. "The energy isn't there and there's a question of competence now about whether they can deliver on some of these infrastructure promises that they're making." Labour has called for an independent commission to be set up to end what it says are "decades of drift and delay" on major infrastructure decisions. Business groups have also warned about the slow pace of infrastructure spending, saying it holds the key to a sustainable long-term recovery. "Despite the scale of the UK Guarantee Scheme, only around a third of firms are aware of it, so this announcement will help raise awareness to other projects struggling to find finance," said the CBI's Rhian Kelly. "The government now needs to push more of these pre-qualification projects through the approval stage so that they can get off the drawing board." </body>

      <title>Lone bid wins Brazil oilfield rights</title>
      <description>Rights to explore Brazil's biggest oilfield are auctioned to the sole bidder - a Brazilian-led consortium - amid angry clashes in Rio.</description>

      <body>The rights to explore Brazil's biggest oilfield have been won at an auction by a consortium led by Brazil's state-run Petrobras, backed by Total, Shell and Chinese firms. The group made the only bid in the auction, offering the minimum share of the surplus production. The Rio de Janeiro beachfront hotel, where the auction took place, was guarded by 1,100 security personnel. Earlier, striking oil workers opposed to the contest clashed with police. Eleven companies had expressed interest in the Libra oilfield, but the Spanish Repsol pulled out on Monday, leaving the five winners as the only ones to present a bid. Chinese state companies CNPC and CNOOC offered 10% each, while the French oil giant Total and the Anglo-Dutch Shell held another 20% stake each. Despite the lack of other offers, Mines and Energy Minister Edison Lobao told reporters he was "not one bit frustrated" by the contest having been won by the lowest possible bid. The president of the government's National Petroleum Agency, Magda Chambriard, called the auction an "absolute success". "It is hard to imagine a more successful outcome. These companies are among the world's 10 most valuable in the energy branch," she said. Petrobras offered a 10% stake on top of the 30% it was already entitled to according to the auctioning rules. The consortium secured the rights to explore the Libra's estimated 8-12 billion barrels of recoverable oil reserves for 35 years. Heavy security has been in place around the hotel in the western Rio district Barra da Tijuca since Sunday. But violence broke out on Monday morning, as protesters tried to invade the cordoned area close to the hotel. Security officers fired rubber bullets, tear gas and pepper bombs at protesters who threw stones and used corrugated iron sheets as shields. The clashes were watched by a crowd spending the public holiday on Barra da Tijuca beach. "There were bizarre scenes. Riot police firing tear gas and stun grenades, not just against protesters, but also on to the beach, with hundreds of tourists and sun worshippers looking on incredulously," the BBC's Wyre Davies reports from Rio de Janeiro. Several protesters were injured. President Dilma Rousseff had ordered tight security after violent demonstrations in Rio last week. Among the protesters are members of various unions representing oil workers, who have been on strike since Thursday at more than 40 oil platforms and refineries. The unions accuse the government of "selling off" Brazil's riches. Others argued that the rules set by the government for the auction allowed too much state intervention, scaring off big players such as BP and Exxon. The Libra field belongs to the Brazilian government's National Petroleum Agency (ANP) and is part of huge oil reserves discovered in 2010. The offshore oilfield is located at a depth of some 5,000m (16,500ft), below a thick layer of rock, sand and salt, which makes its exploration extremely challenging. The discovery potentially doubles Brazil's known oil reserves. </body>

      <title>How big retailers learned to love fashion</title>
      <description>Big retailers are rethinking the way they sell clothing and going for a high fashion rather than a low price approach.</description>

      <body>When Sir Stuart Rose says something on retail, it's worth listening. With a 40-year track record in the industry, the former chief executive and chairman of Marks and Spencer is famed for turning around struggling retailers. Now an independent, non-executive director at South Africa's Woolworths Holdings, a chain of shops selling fashion, food, beauty and home ware, he says retail has changed. "Where the customer used to be king before, the customer is now the master of the universe: and they want what they want, how they want it, when they want it." For Woolworths, this shift has been felt most keenly in clothing - an area that along with beauty and home ware makes up 38% of its business in South Africa. In response, over the past two to three years it has made a conscious effort to make its clothing more fashionable, which crucially has involved getting it from the design stage to the shop floor much more quickly. "Previously it was 11-months-plus for all of our clothing products to the point now where we can turn [an item] around in 90 days," says Ian Moir, chief executive of Woolworths (which has no connection with the former British High Street chain of the same name). The strategy appears to be working. The company's most recent results for the year to the end of June saw clothing sales grow by 13.7%. "If we don't give the customer the trend, the colour, the fashion they're looking for, at the end of the day they're going to go somewhere else," says Mr Moir. Neil Saunders, managing director at retail consultancy Conlumino, says the changes at Woolworths reflect a "sea change" in how supermarket groups sell clothing. "They have become more like clothing retailers. Five years ago they used to merchandise it in the same way as, for example, baked beans. They piled it high and sold it cheap. But now they have become lifestyle rather than commodity-led." Mr Saunders says the 2008 financial crisis and resulting recession is a key reason behind this change in approach, with a trend for people to choose quality items that they expect to last. "Before the recession people bought lots of stuff... they even bought stuff they didn't wear. There was a disposable element because clothing was cheap and people felt affluent. "People are more frugal now. They buy less stuff and follow the ethos of, 'If you buy it right you buy it once.'" Mr Saunders says, however, that low prices can still lure in customers if they are combined with fashion, citing Primark as an example. "It's on trend and that makes people very interested. But if a retailer just chases value then they struggle," he adds. UK supermarket group Sainsbury's founded its clothing range Tu almost a decade ago. James Brown, clothing business director at Sainsbury's, says when Tu began it was focused on core products such as leggings, jogging bottoms and T-shirts, with ranges changed every 12 weeks or longer. But in the past two years it has become more trend-led. "Since our recent rebrand the new Tu range is refreshed every six weeks to keep up with the latest fashions, and offer new products to our customer," says Mr Brown. "Over the last nine years we have learnt more about our broad customer base and have adapted the range to offer more High Street-style garments at supermarket prices to meet customer demand," he adds. The approach seems to be working - at its recent trading update for the 16 weeks to 28 September it said its general merchandise and clothing business grew at more than twice the rate of its food business. Mr Brown says new items are planned up to seven months in advance, but that it can react quickly to last-minute trends by turning around a style in just eight weeks, assuming it can get the necessary fabric and has the production capacity. In contrast, for High Street chain Zara, production capacity is rarely an issue because unusually its owner Inditex has its own factories. These manufacture what it says is a "significant share" of its clothing for its eight brands, which include upmarket Massimo Dutti and teen label Bershka, but primarily the most fashionable garments. For those items the clothes can be produced and in store in a rapid two to three weeks. "Customer expectations are higher than ever so our capability to adapt and react to their demands is one of our key strengths," says an Inditex source. For Ian Moir, this is the key to Woolworths' future. "The importance of fashion is becoming greater and greater and customer awareness is getting better and better. "They're very fashion aware and they want it now. That's the way the world is going, it's the way it's changing and it's the way we've got to change as a business."

      <title>Australia's surf firms making waves</title>
      <description>Surfing is a national pastime in Australia, which continues to sustain a significant community of small firms, as the BBC's Phil Mercer reports.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24517642</url>
      <date>1381964753</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70463000/jpg/_70463014_aus1afp.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>A century ago, Duke Kahanamoku, a majestic Hawaiian board rider, helped to ignite modern Australia's passion for surfing. His showboating exhibition on the waves at Freshwater Beach in Sydney is widely seen as the catalyst for a national obsession. Picked from a curious crowd, a teenage girl was given what was almost certainly Australia's first official surfing lesson by the man known simply as the Duke. Today, the same swells that barrel in from the Pacific Ocean continue to thrill and they now sustain a range of small businesses that feed the popular surf tourism industry. At nearby Manly Beach, a class of beginners is about to take to the water for the very first time. It's a hot day in spring, and conditions are perfect for novices - the breeze is light, the waves gentle and the tuition patient. "It's a tough sport. Surfing is very similar to golf - you never master it, there are always things you can learn," says Nick James, from Manly Surf School, which was founded in 1995 and has 20 full-time staff. It pays about 50,000 Australian dollars ($47,000; £29,600) per year to the local council for exclusive rights to operate on one of Sydney's most celebrated stretches of sand. A standard two-hour group lesson for an adult costs A$70, while children pay A$55. Mr James says that business is generally vibrant, but admits that, like the weather, things can be unpredictable. "It's challenging. We've got to pay licences to run our surf schools on the beaches. "It's a good business, but there are times when we're closed for a week due to the surf conditions." There are 35 licensed surf schools in New South Wales, the most populous state in Australia. The sport's regional governing body has estimated that surfing pumps more than A$500m into the state's economy. "The sport is becoming increasingly more attractive," says Mark Windon, chief executive of Surfing New South Wales. "It is becoming more mainstream. It is just going to get more popular. In the next 10 years, you'll probably see triple the growth that you've seen in the last 10." At Manly, the latest converts tentatively paddle out for their initial encounter with the breakers. They have limited success - boards suddenly become airborne, dumping their breathless passengers into the drink. But back they come for more, and herein lies the secret to surfing's success. For many, its magnetic appeal is irresistible, and what's hearty for the soul is also good for the bottom line, according to Stacey Randell, executive officer of the Manly Chamber of Commerce. "Our whole region is based on the water, and surfing is huge economically speaking, and the amount of visitors it brings in every year is vital to the businesses in this community. Everybody benefits from this culture," she says. Yet while wave riding in Australia has never been more popular, independent surfing shops are struggling to stay afloat in a highly competitive market. "It is not particularly an easy living for most surf shop owners. You'll find most of them are pressed pretty hard by the big corporates to sell specific merchandise and conform to corporate dictates," says Doug Booth, the Australian-born dean of the School of Physical Education, Sport and Exercise Sciences at the University of Otago in New Zealand. A couple of streets back from Manly's sun-drenched waterfront, Tim Hanrahan, the owner of the Aloha surf shop, unloads another consignment of high-end boards. I ask if his head is financially above water? "Just," he says, laughing. "I make OK money." "It's difficult. It's not an easy job. The profit margins particularly on the boards are quite low. I've seen a lot of competitors come and go. "There is a lot of tourism in Manly, but realistically you've got to have the locals behind you, too. That's what keeps you going through the quieter months." Surfing Australia estimates there are more than 2.5 million recreational board riders around the country. It is far beyond simply a sport, but a lifestyle and cultural phenomenon that tourists are keen to experience. "I've always wanted to surf," says Ashton Williams, an investment software worker from Mississippi in the United States, as he wades out of the ocean at the end of his lesson at Manly. "It's much tougher than I thought, but when you're finally gliding over the water it is one of the most peaceful things. It's pretty amazing." </body>

      <title>Nepalese airline taking off</title>
      <description>The BBC's Surendra Phuyal talks to Birendra Bahadur Basnet about growing a private airline in Nepal.</description>

      <body>What makes an entrepreneur? The BBC's Surendra Phuyal hears from Birendra Bahadur Basnet, a private-airline owner in Nepal, about the risks he took starting his business, and how he believes success can be achieved. He does not come from a family of business people. His father is a retired judge, his ancestors were farmers in eastern Nepal. But Birendra Bahadur Basnet, 49, is amongst Nepal's most successful entrepreneurs. He has carved a niche in the country's not-so-impressive aviation sector in just a few years. When he registered his airline, Buddha Air, and started operations in 1996, the business graduate from a Kathmandu university had only one aircraft that was purchased with a loan: a US-made Beechcraft 1900D. Nearly two decades later, he is is the proud owner of nine aircraft - three Beechcraft 1900, three ATR 42-320 and three ATR 72-500 aircraft. Basnet's Buddha Air fleet is the largest in Nepal's domestic sector. "When we obtained the loan of around NPR 70m (£442,000; $708,000) in 1996 to set up our business and purchase an aircraft, our friends and relatives and other people said we had gone mad," Basnet, says, smiling. "But we started doing good in aviation sector and we paid our loan after six years," he says, adding his airline business has grown almost ten-fold since then. When he started, he recalls Nepal's state-owned airline Royal Nepal Airlines was not particularly successful and the newly liberalised domestic aviation market was looking for stable players from the private sector. "That's precisely where we saw the gap and we jumped in," he says. "The market was competitive, but safety, reliability and comfort being our mantra, we succeeded in winning the trust of our customers and we have been adding aircraft, one after another to our fleet." Basnet's road to success has not been easy though; the biggest blow came in September 2011 when one of his Beechcraft crashed on a hill near Kathmandu while returning from an aborted Mount Everest sightseeing flight, killing 19 people. "We thought we were invincible, but that crash proved we were not," he said, tears welling up in his eyes. "We lost three of our great colleagues, several other people and the aircraft. "That was a very sad experience that we had, but that also helped us grow." After the crash, he says, the airline did a review of its flight safety mechanisms and other related procedures to ensure that Buddha Air's safety standards remain impeccable. "We thought people would choose other airlines after the crash, we were concerned," he says. "But that didn't affect our business. People - both Nepalis and foreigners - continued to love us." Every morning, Buddha Air attracts dozens of foreign tourists to Kathmandu airport for its early morning sightseeing flights to the Mount Everest region - it hosted former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan when he visited Nepal in 2001. Boasting Nepal's first private airline to have its own hangar within Kathmandu Airport premises, Buddha Air flies to major towns inside Nepal and connects the Indian city of Varanashi with Kathmandu. "We are the first private airline to fly outside Nepal," says Basnet, adding that he plans to take Buddha Air to other major cities in the Asia Pacific region in future to better facilitate connectivity for passengers flying into and out of Nepal. Buddha Air currently employs more than 700 people, offering them salaries between 150 dollars and thousands of dollars per month. "They are a mostly happy bunch of people," he says. "We are like a happy family, but still we need to make sure that everyone is looked after and content." His recipe for success remains this: "Don't multi-task, focus on your goal. Success is floating around, all you have to do is go and grab it. But again, you have to focus on what you want to do and what you want to achieve." </body>

      <title>Milk Cup tournament loses sponsor</title>
      <description>The Milk Cup youth football tournament is dealt a blow after the Dairy Council ends its sponsorship of the competition.</description>

      <body>The Milk Cup youth football tournament has been dealt a blow after the Dairy Council for Northern Ireland ended its sponsorship of the annual competition. A statement from the Dairy Council said that the decision had been taken following a "strategic review" of its activities in Northern Ireland. The Dairy Council began sponsoring the tournament in 1983. "This was not an easy decision for us but no sponsorship is permanent," said Dairy Council chief Mike Johnston. The competition's traditional base over the last 30 years has been Coleraine with games also taking place in Portrush, Portstewart, Ballymoney and Limavady. In more recent years, the finals night has taken place at the Ballymena Showgrounds while there have also been games in places such as Cloughmills and Broughshane. Despite Monday's announcement, tournament chairman Victor Leonard told BBC Sport that planning is already well underway for the 2014 competition and that it would "definitely go ahead" next summer. "The future of the Milk Cup is very secure," added the tournament chairman. "2014 will be a very strong event. We are at an advanced stage with teams and actually looking to enhance the event. "The partnership with the Dairy Council has been a very exciting and very beneficial one but we already have some things going on in the background, preparing for this day." However, there is no doubt that the loss of the main sponsor has to be regarded as a blow for the youth tournament. "The Milk Cup has been a hugely important and successful sponsorship for the Dairy Council since we became involved 30 years ago but the market has evolved," added the Dairy Council chief executive, Mr Johnston. "But we need to ensure that our activities meet the needs of the Northern Ireland dairy industry. "We are delighted that over the past three decades we have played our part in making the Milk Cup one of the top events of its kind in the world. "One of the things that attracted us to the event in the early 1980s was the opportunity it provided for local lads to have the experience of playing against teams from other countries and cultures. "At a time when Northern Ireland was in the grip of a dark period in its history and amidst negative publicity in international media, it will always be a testament to the tournament that teams from all over the world were prepared to come to Northern Ireland." Future stars who have played in the tournament include David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Wayne Rooney, Neil Lennon, Joe Cole and Keith Gillespie. </body>

      <body>A second sale of tickets for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow has seen "high demand" with delays of more than 60 minutes for online booking. People who did not manage to get any tickets during the first sale can make purchases on Monday and Tuesday. From 10:00 on Wednesday, applicants who received some tickets in the first sale will also be able buy additional ones. Rugby sevens, badminton, hockey, table tennis, squash, bowls and weightlifting are said to have the best availability. Limited tickets also remain for some sessions of athletics, boxing and rhythmic gymnastics. After the second sale commenced at 10:00 on Tuesday, some people went online to express delight at netting the tickets of their choice, while others spoke of delays of "more than 60 minutes" as they tried to book seats online. The official Glasgow 2014 Twitter account welcomed people's patience amid the strong demand. One message said: "We're experiencing very high demand for #2014tickets. The site is up and selling but the queues are large and we appreciate your patience." Another message said: "Call volumes to the ticketing hotline are very high." In feedback made to the BBC news website, one ticket hopeful, Carole Young, said: "Logged on to official site at 10.03 am, now 11.34 am still waiting in a queue very very disappointed." Another, Jacqueline Farrell, said: "I have been sitting on line since 9.15 this morning waiting to log onto our accounts. "The browser kept trying to do something but nothing and then it logged me out and then I had to sign back in and am now in a further 60 minute queue - so, so disappointing." Others, like Fiona, however, expressed their delight at securing tickets: "I was unsuccessful getting tickets in the first ballot and tried again this morning. "Was really pleased to get myself and my daughter day and evening tickets to the rhythmic gymnastics on the 24th July." Craig Martin was also successful: "Was in the queue for about an hour then was allowed to buy tickets - there were quite a few left. "Think I got the last athletics tickets. Also got tickets to see Northern Ireland in netball and tickets for lawn bowls." During the initial four-week window for the Glasgow 2014 Games, there were 2.3 million requests for up to one million tickets. Of the 17 sports on offer, track cycling, diving, swimming, judo, shooting and the 100m sprint final were all over-subscribed and needed ballots to select who received tickets. The second batch of tickets are being allocated on a first-come, first-served basis through the official ticketing website or ticket hotline. From Wednesday the sale will be opened up to people who got some of the tickets they wanted, before all of the Glasgow 2014 ticket applicants are invited to buy tickets until 18:00 on Saturday. Any remaining tickets will then be put on general sale. Ty Speer, deputy chief executive of Glasgow 2014 said: "We're all set for this exciting new phase of ticketing during which there may be periods of high demand as people select and buy their sports and sessions. "At these times we'd appreciate the patience of all customers. We will be working hard to process all orders as quickly as possible." The Commonwealth Games Baton Relay is also currently making its way round the world before returning to Scotland next year. </body>

      <body>Kilmarnock chairman Michael Johnston says he would step aside from his position if the right investors can be attracted to Rugby Park. Johnston has been under pressure from fans groups to leave the club and was the subject of more protests during Saturday's 2-0 win over Ross County. But he insisted to BBC Scotland that he is open to change. "I'm looking for more local business people to work in partnership for the benefit of the club," said Johnston. "Billy Bowie is the first person since the Moffat family to table an offer of finance." Johnston, who inherited the Scottish Premiership club from the Moffats, revealed that Ayrshire businessman Bowie had invested £200,000 in Kilmarnock, with a further £1.1m promised. The chairman believes he has more to achieve before leaving Kilmarnock and intends reducing debts of around £9m. However, he admitted that, if new investors offer the right money, he would consider his position. Johnston has held talks with the Kilmarnock Futures Consortium and the group is understood to be set to present its takeover plan to the Kilmarnock chairman shortly. Bowie is also believed to be open to working with the consortium headed up by Alan McLeish from the club's kit sponsor, QTS. The 2-0 victory over County was Kilmarnock's first of the season and the first for Allan Johnston, who was appointed manager in the summer. Supporters held up red cards in the 18th and 69th minutes, symbolic of when the club was founded in 1869, in protest at the chairman's running of the club. </body>

Pete Wishart, who played keyboards with Runrig, and now represents the SNP in Parliament, compares online piracy to stealing from shops. He says intellectual property rights are "not respected, particularly in an online environment" and as such, investment in the UK's creative industries is at risk. According to the MP: "We have got to start to get it through to people that people that taking something for nothing online is the same as taking something for nothing in the High Street."

      <title>Grangemouth's economic significance</title>
      <description>The significance of the Grangemouth plant to the UK</description>

      <body>The Scottish government is looking to find a buyer for the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemicals plant. The current owner, Ineos, has said the plant will close without new investment and changes to workers' terms and conditions. Finding a buyer for the plant will be a challenge as there is an excess of refining capacity in Europe, meaning profit margins are low. So what would be the impact of the the closure of Grangemouth? Grangemouth refines 80% of the fuel used in Scotland and it also supplies Northern Ireland and the North of England. Contingency plans are being made to replace petrol and diesel supplies if the refinery closes and experts say that fuel could be sourced from elsewhere. "With petrol and diesel supplies, unless there is panic buying, there should not be a problem as there are plenty of imports," says Alexander Kemp, Professor of Petroleum Economics, at the University of Aberdeen. The number of refineries in the UK has been falling for decades and at the moment there are seven. Coryton in Essex was the most recent to close after its owner Petroplus, filed for bankruptcy in 2012. But analysts say there is still overcapacity in Western Europe and the situation has been made worse recently by cheap fuel imports from the United States. US refineries pay around $15 a barrel less than UK refineries for crude oil, which has helped US firms to export cheap fuel to the UK. But Professor Kemp says there is a longer term issue of energy security for the UK as "we can't always rely on cheap imports of fuel". At the moment the UK imports 47% of the diesel and 50% of the aviation fuel it needs. But for petrol there is currently a 20% oversupply, according to figures from the research group, IHS Purvin and Getz. Its research shows that if two refineries were to close down, the UK would rely on imports for more than 70% of its diesel and jet fuel and more than 20% of its petrol. The Grangemouth refinery has an annual turnover of billions of pounds a year and has 1,370 staff. It also employs another 2,000 contractors and the refinery's owner, Ineos, estimates that 10,000 jobs indirectly rely on the facility. Due to the refinery and the associated chemicals business, the Falkirk area employs more people in manufacturing than the rest of Scotland combined. "It's actually a fundamental part of the infrastructure of the chemical, petrochemical and plastics industries of the UK and it would be madness to have it shut down," said the local Labour MP, Michael Connarty. But Ineos says the refinery is losing £10m a month and needs an investment of £300m. The Forties pipeline delivers a third of the UK's oil output. The steam and power which runs the pipeline and BP's Kinneil terminal comes from Grangemouth. At the moment the supply of steam and power has not been interrupted and Ineos and union workers have been keen to maintain supplies. But if Grangemouth is forced to close then it is not clear what happens next. A strike at Grangemouth in 2008 shut the Kinneil terminal and that forced 70 North Sea oil platforms to shut down or reduce production. PetroChina owns half the refinery which is operated by Ineos. It can process 210,000 barrels of crude daily. Ineos also owns the petrochemical plant which is attached to the refinery. Analysts say the petrochemicals plant would struggle to run profitably without the refinery. </body>

      <body>The economy of Burma, officially called Myanmar, is open for business. That's the message the reformist government of President Thein Sein is sending out, and it has got an overwhelmingly positive response from investors. But behind the impressive headline figures of planned ventures and promised aid, who is actually doing well in the new Burma? There have been some high-profile announcements - Nissan and Suzuki want to manufacture cars, Ford has opened a dealership, Coca-Cola already has a local bottling plant. But many foreign investors are waiting both for infrastructure to improve and for greater political certainty before jumping in. The indigenous Burmese business community, on the other hand, has been a hive of activity. Inevitably, the companies best placed to profit from the new opportunities are the so-called cronies - those who built up their businesses through close co-operation with the old military regime. Despite still being listed on US sanctions lists, with their resources and experience, they are winning many of the new infrastructure contracts. Smaller companies, though, are cashing in on booming demand for property, consumer goods and services. Wai Thit Lwin, a graduate from Berkeley in her 20s, juggles looking after her two young daughters, expanding a local chain of 50 convenience stores, and helping manage a company that operates hospitals, hotels, and markets brands such as Sony and LG in Burma. Everything she is involved in is growing fast. Her main concerns? The inadequacy of Burma's banking system - local companies have to pay punishing interest rates for capital - and the threat of competition from the convenience store giant 7-11. Then there was Cho Thet Nwe, who left school to help bring up her brothers, but is now the brand manager for the French cosmetics company L'Oreal. "When we started selling European products here in 1996, it was so difficult," she recalls. "Back then the whole family would use the same soap, from head to toe. We were trying to sell facial foams and shampoo - we had to start educating them from zero. But now lifestyles have changed tremendously." One of the most conspicuous improvements in consumer choice is the availability of mobile phones. When I first reported from Burma 12 years ago only a tiny elite were allowed to buy mobiles. The phones themselves were heavy, ancient, first generation models. Today Sim cards are available, although still in limited numbers and for a much higher price than in neighbouring countries. And you can buy pretty much any model of phone, from the numerous, glaringly lit shops in Rangoon (also known as Yangon). Myat Thiri Khaing studied Chinese at university, intending to work as a translator. Instead she joined one of Burma's first phone retailers, Lu Gyi Min, excited by the possibilities of technology. Today she is the manager of the busy Latha Street branch, doing evening classes in management to improve her chances of promotion. The business is growing quickly, she told me, especially outside Rangoon, where they have plans to open more branches. But amid these positive stories, the majority of Burmese have yet to feel any material benefits from the reforms. And there are some who feel they are losing out in this new and unpredictable environment. A few kilometres from downtown Rangoon is south Dagon, designated an industrial zone back in the days of military rule. Part of it is given over to rows of small iron foundries, operating the most primitive technology. Sweat-grimed workers pull glowing strips of metal from open furnaces, and toss them expertly to others who catch them with tongs, and run them through clattering presses. I met U Mitthya, who assembles small pick-up trucks, his workers welding them by hand. In the days of military rule, when car imports were tightly restricted, it was a good business. Now as inexpensive vehicle imports flood in, it is no longer a viable business. He said the three trucks in his workshop were probably the last he would make. The big plans to expand Burma's industrial base have caused casualties too. The most ambitious project is a planned industrial estate next to the port of Thilawa, south of Rangoon, to provide an area of reliable power and suitable infrastructure for Japanese manufacturers. But this requires moving the people who have been living on the land for many years. Daw Htay Htay and a few of her neighbours say that under military rule they had been forced to give up their land for paltry compensation. But as the planned project never took off, they simply carried on cultivating it. Now the government wants to start construction of Thilawa, as early as the end of this year. It has offered the value of six years' rice harvests, and an alternative plot of land. Daw Htay Htay says she is being put under pressure by officials to accept, but feels the compensation is not enough. In this time of change, she told me: "I feel it is only we who are losing." But it is not only her. Land disputes have erupted all over the country, as new economic opportunities make previously worthless land valuable again. This is an emotional issue, with the potential to overshadow much of the good news that is coming out of Burma these days. </body>

      <title>Crowdfunding the arts in South Africa</title>
      <description>South African musicians ask their listeners to turn investors</description>

      <body>Money for a Monteverdi melody, and Bach for their buck. The Cape Consort is a Cape Town-based ensemble in search of investment to help them put on a concert. As with many struggling artists, they are in need of funding. After all, "musicians need to pay rent and eat just like everybody else," says Hans Huyssen, cellist with the group. The Cape Consort has turned to crowdfunding, an online collective fundraising approach. They achieved their target amount of 15,000 rand ($1,525; £945), raising 60% of that in just six days. The funds raised allowed them to put on a series of concerts, with the last one having just taken place on Sunday in Cape Town. Instead of approaching one investor to ask for capital, crowdfunding is an online platform that allows small initiatives like Cape Consort to post proposals on a dedicated website and ask the world wide crowd for funding. Even though the concept of collective fundraising is not new, (New York-based Kickstarter is widely credited with pioneering online crowdfunding in 2009), one crowdfunding website in South Africa is using it in an unusual way, to get funding for the arts. Patrick Schofield is the founder of Thundafund, described as a "crowdfunding cafe" for African innovators and creative entrepreneurs. It provides both a crowdfunding platform together with mentorship. "I think the funding is one thing but people need the supporting environment to help them realise their idea and to make it successful, and that's what we bring together," he says. Thundafund has been up and running for over four months, and 80% of the projects that have gone on the website have gained funding. Michelle Constant is the chief executive of Business and Arts South Africa (BASA), a public-private partnership that aims to build partnerships between business and the arts. "It's simplistic to assume that the private sector and the government can do all the funding of the arts as we move forward into the future," she says. Funding arts projects will always take a backseat to issues such as reducing poverty and improving healthcare and housing - issues which are key in Africa. "So if there is an opportunity where people who in their individual capacity can give [to the arts], it's exciting," says Ms Constant. But crowdfunding for the arts is about more than just funding a specific project - it's also about tapping into a more engaged audience by using technology as a platform. Mr Schofield compares the power of crowdfunding as a vehicle for raising money to the power of social media when it comes to current affairs. "When you talk to 100 people and say, 'look, I'm not asking you for a huge amount, instead I'm going to say back me with a small amount and together we'll all make it happen' - in many ways it's the same way as news is fed through Twitter. "There's 100 people talking about the event and it's often so much more powerful than one voice and they will funnel 100 people together to a larger channel." With crowdfunding, as with any investment, you get a return. However, rather than a financial return, what you're most likely to gain is a creative product, be it a book, play, performance or CD. On the other hand, unlike with a financial product, you know exactly what you're getting for your money as those who are doing the crowdfunding have to be upfront about what they can offer. For instance, for an investment of 50 rand the Cape Consort will put your name on their website. Meanwhile, for 20,000 rand you can get four tickets to one of their performances, signed programmes, and an exclusive private concert among other things. But can online crowdfunding work in a country where so many people don't have access to the internet? Media analyst Arthur Goldstuck says it is already working, adding that while the digital divide may not be an issue, there are challenges. "Those who have the means to participate in crowdfunding wouldn't really be the 'have-nots', so in South Africa the 'haves' have relatively good internet access… so that really isn't the constraint," Mr Goldstuck says. "The constraint is more around trust of the crowdfunding model and the essence of crowdfunding is you have to hype up your product and create enthusiasm for it and that's not how investors like to be drawn into an investment opportunity." Thundafund's Patrick Schofield also believes that the crowdfunding model can be an ideological tool that can bring about change. He calls crowdfunding "funds with benefits" and says it "allows us to make the world as we would like it". If the audience supports an idea online, the idea will come to life; if there's no support, there's no execution. This allows an interactive audience to dictate what they want to see in the creative arts arena by supporting it. As Hans Huyssen, from the Cape Consort, says, "music is not something that relies on musicians only. "I mean we can rehearse and perform, but unless somebody hears what we do, the musical experience doesn't happen. "So you're involving your audience not only in concert, but also in advance, and to make them aware that they have a responsibility for the music to happen." </body>

      <title>UK QE has failed, says QE inventor</title>
      <description>Where did the phrase 'quantitative easing' come from?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24614016</url>

      <body>When the UK embarked on quantitative easing (QE) in March 2009, in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse, the Bank of England was expected to administer a monetary stimulus equal to £50bn, writes Liam Halligan. Over the past four years, such "extraordinary measures" have extended somewhat more, with the Bank's bond-buying programme now amounting to £375bn - almost eight times the original estimate. Since the financial crisis began, the Bank of England's balance sheet has expanded four-fold. But where did the phrase "quantitative easing" come from? Arguably among the most controversial economic policies of recent years, QE is surely the most unpronounceable. Not many Western analysts are aware that this tongue-challenging name originated in Japan, the modern-day spiritual home of money-printing. Even fewer know that the man who coined the phrase comes from Germany - which, of all the big Western economies, has probably the most deep-seated aversion to printing money. In the mid-1990s, Prof Richard Werner, a German academic fluent in Japanese, was working as an economist in Tokyo. Japan's real estate bubble had burst and property and share prices were tumbling. The country was locked in a debate about the use of unconventional monetary policy to support asset prices and boost broader commercial activity. Prof Werner submitted an article to Nikkei, a leading business newspaper, advocating a new type of radical monetary measure. Rather than attempting to shift interest rates, he argued that the country's central bank, the Bank of Japan should instead intervene directly to influence the size of the money supply by taking steps to encourage commercial banks to extend more credit. "I was promoting a policy that involved more credit creation, rather than changing the price of money," says Prof Werner. "So when I wrote my article, and after the newspaper's editors insisted on a phrase readers would understand, I added the Japanese adjective for quantity to the standard expression for monetary stimulation. 'Quantitative easing' was the literal translation back into English of these two Japanese words." Prof Werner's article was widely noticed. Several years later, in fact, the Bank of Japan decided to implement extreme monetary measures and adopted the Japanese name the German economist had coined. "In 2001, the Japanese central bank said, 'Now we're actually doing this'," he recalls. "To communicate this to global markets, they had to give the policy a name in English. I suppose the translators had a bad day, or were under time pressure. Normally, you'd try to come up with something slightly more fluent than 'quantitative easing', but they did only a literal translation." While the Bank of Japan adopted the precise name of Prof Werner's policy, it was somewhat less accurate when interpreting his actual proposal. Incredibly, the Japanese version of QE that was eventually implemented was a policy Prof Werner had specifically ruled-out. Prof Werner's argument was that, because more than 95% of the money supply in a modern economy is derived not from cash or reserves, but from private bank lending, it is essential to get banks to lend. So he urged the Japanese government to enter into private long-term agreements to borrow from commercial banks, instead of issuing government debt. The Bank of Japan's version of QE, in contrast, involved creating money out of nothing at the central bank. "That's absolutely not what my policy was about," says Prof Werner. "In my original article, I specifically argued against either lowering interest rates or expanding central bank reserves. That was my whole point - traditional solutions weren't going to work. Actually, it was a bit upsetting." Then, in an additional twist, the Bank of England also later adopted Prof Werner's QE label - but, again, to describe a policy with which he didn't agree. "It was one thing when the Bank of Japan did it, because that was over in Japan and was some time ago," he says. "But once the Bank of England also started using the phrase, I thought 'Hang on - I've got to speak up and make clear that the original definition is quite different.'" The Bank of England's interpretation of QE also involves the creation of central bank credits, as in Japan. But in the UK these have been used to buy government bonds from commercial banks rather than from the government directly. Prof Werner says this is "a little better" than Japanese QE, as it "at least in theory increases commercial banks' reserves". He maintains, though, that the "best way to boost the economy is to increase bank credit", and that can only be guaranteed by governments borrowing from banks directly. "That creates new credit," says Prof Werner. "The money supply then expands, transactions increase, there's more demand, more employment, more tax revenues and suddenly you have a virtuous circle." In both Japan and the UK, QE isn't working, he says, because it doesn't focus on "the most important part of the money supply", which is bank lending. "UK QE has singularly failed, as bank credit is still shrinking." When faced with the claim used by some British banks that the demand for credit is low, Prof Werner is dismissive. "I'm quite used to this argument, because banks in Japan used it for 20 years," he says. "The banks, of course, have become very risk-averse, as they have many non-performing assets." Prof Werner is also critical of the UK's concentrated banking structure - which he argues has made the economy more vulnerable. "British banking is dominated by a small number of big banks - with just five banks controlling 90% of deposits," he says. "Big banks want to lend to big firms and do big deals that give big bonuses. Small firms are too much hassle, and the banks are absolutely not interested - even though small firms need the credit and account for 70% of UK employment. So these small firms are credit-rationed and that's a problem." "In Germany, 70% of deposits are held by 2,000 banks," says Prof Werner. "These local German banks lend a lot more to small- and medium-sized firms, and when the credit crunch happened most of them were fine." When it comes to QE, although his policy recommendations have been misinterpreted in Japan, the UK and elsewhere, Prof Werner maintains his natural sense of humour about giving the world a phrase that's so challenging to say. "It's become a household name anyway and I should get some kind of fee, some royalties, for that," he says with a smile. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Nuclear strike price</title>
      <description>What is the strike price and why is it needed?</description>

      <body>The government has finally agreed a nuclear strike price with French power company EDF. But what is this price and why is it needed? Nuclear what price? No-one is talking about a nuclear strike here - Armageddon is not upon us. The nuclear strike price simply refers to the price the government has guaranteed EDF per unit of electricity produced from its proposed new nuclear reactors at Hinkley in Somerset. Why do we need a strike price in the first place? Because the government has maintained all along that it will not provide any public subsidies to the nuclear industry. It would not actually be illegal to do so, but the coalition would need permission from the European Union. Any such u-turn would be hugely embarrassing, however, not to mention hugely unpopular. How does the price work in practice? In essence, the government has guaranteed EDF a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour (Mwh), so if the market price of electricity falls below this level, the government has in effect said it will make sure EDF receives the difference between the two prices. The wholesale price of electricity at the moment is about £45/Mwh. If the wholesale price remains at this level, then EDF will receive an additional £47.50/Mwh. In practice, this money will not come from taxpayers (that would count as a subsidy), but from consumers of electricity. The strike price works the other way as well - EDF has to refund the difference if the price of electricity is above £92.50/Mwh. For example, if the wholesale price is £110/Mwh, then it has to refund £18.50/Mwh. Again, this money goes back to bill payers, not to the government. The strike price will fall from £92.50 to £89.50 if EDF agrees to develop another new reactor in Sizewell, Suffolk. This simply reflects the fact that EDF's costs will be lower per reactor if it builds two of them. But why the need for any guaranteed price? Nuclear reactors cost a lot of money, and EDF wants to build two of them. The final bill is estimated at £16bn. Even for a massive company like EDF, this is a huge investment, which makes it inherently risky. For example, if the price of electricity falls, or becomes more volatile, the company could lose a lot of money. And because the plant would take 10 years to build, there is simply too much uncertainty to commit to such a huge investment. For this reason, EDF needs an added incentive to build the reactors. Knowing it will receive a guaranteed price for the electricity generated at Hinkley provides some kind of certainty that the investment will be worthwhile - in other words, profitable. For its part, the government has been unable to play different energy companies off against each other, as German power giants RWE and E.On have decided against building new plants in the UK. It has, therefore, been forced to negotiate with EDF. But this doesn't mean EDF holds all the cards - the company is desperate to get Hinkley Point C started so it can serve as a blueprint for similar power stations across the world. So what does it mean for bills? Until we know the price of electricity on the open market when Hinkley Point C starts generating power, we simply won't know. If the electricity price is below the strike price, then bills will probably go up. If it is above the strike price, then bills could go down. It will also depend on the energy mix at the time, in other words how much of your electricity is generated by nuclear power. At the moment, almost 20% of the UK's power is generated by nuclear reactors, but this is likely to fall in the short term as the UK's current nuclear capacity is decommissioned. This is all very well, but why are we building new nuclear power plants? Precisely because there will be a shortfall in electricity generation as a result of existing nuclear power stations going offline. The question then is how to make up this shortfall. The government is committed to renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, but to get enough generating capacity from these sources will take too long, so another solution is needed. In theory, it could simply increase power generation from traditional fossil fuels such as coal and gas, but stringent, legally-binding CO2 emissions targets mean this is not possible. There is some room for an increase in gas-generated power, but as we import most of this gas, the government has concerns about energy security - it wants us to generate our own power, not rely on others for it. So, in the government's eyes, that leaves nuclear. And it wants EDF to lead by example, paving the way for other power companies to invest in new reactors in the UK, because two new reactors will not be enough. </body>

      <body>Robert Stanzione is the boss of one of the largest companies you have probably never heard of. Mr Stanzione is chief executive of fast-growing US technology group Arris. The company makes set-top boxes, and other pieces of hardware and software for digital television and broadband services. Arris made the business headlines at the end of last year when it agreed a $2.35bn (£1.5bn) deal to buy the Motorola Home set-top box business from Google. The internet giant had put Motorola Home up for sale after it had bought parent group Motorola Mobility, the main part of which was Motorola's mobile phone business. Arris' purchase of Motorola Home was completed in the spring of this year, and saw the Georgia-based company - in terms of turnover - triple in size overnight. It means that in the US, the Arris name will increasingly be seen on set-top boxes as the Motorola brand is retired. Whereas in the UK, Arris' technology is already used by the likes of BT and Virgin Media. Mr Stanzione said the Motorola Home deal highlighted Arris' continuing ambition. "As soon as we heard rumours that it was going to be up for sale, we began to look at where it would take us, it will fuel our continued growth as a company," says Mr Stanzione. "We have tripled the size of the company over the past decade, and this deal sees us grow by that amount again. It is all credit to the team around me." Chief executive of Arris since it was founded in 1995, Mr Stanzione, 65, says he has a very simple but effective strategy for leadership - bringing in the best people to work with him. "Find the right people, keep them, and motivate them," he says. "Let them know how important they are, and give them clear responsibility. I think that's the key to success." Mr Stanzione says he wanted to make a difference in life. "I have always had this curiosity, always had the desire to be around smart people, and participate in a way that would change things," he says. "I am very excited by helping to create new solutions to old problems, being more efficient, more effective." Mr Stanzione adds that while he has always been persistent in his career, he is happy to admit to having had some good fortune along the way. "I have had an element of luck, it would be remiss of me not to say that. Sometimes being in the right place at the right time matters." With a degree in mechanical engineering from Clemson University in South Carolina, and a masters in industrial engineering from North Carolina State University, before joining Arris, Mr Stanzione held a range of engineering and management positions at US telecoms group ATandT. His advice to young people who aspire to go on and lead a large company is to follow his example and get some good qualifications. "First of all, get as much education as you can," he says. "Then get involved in something you enjoy and stick with it. "But success is a very personal thing. For some, ambition is to rise to the top of an organisation - but for others it is earning a lot of money, or something else. "I'd say your primary goal should be to be involved in something meaningful that you also enjoy." With Arris enjoying $1.3bn (£805m) of revenues last year, it was certainly already successful before the Motorola Home takeover. The deal itself saw Arris pay Google $2.2bn in cash, which it funded though debt financing, and the sale of a 7.7% share in its business-to-cable TV firm Comcast. Arris also gave Google 10.6 million of its shares, which gives Google the same minority stake in Arris as Comcast. Mr Stanzione said Arris and its 6,500 employees were now continuing with its aim to cement its position as the world's best provider of the technology behind on-demand TV content. Yet with rivals from around the globe, and especially China, he says he is never complacent. "I'm paranoid every day," he says. "I'm always looking over my shoulder at the competitors, be they other strong American companies, or other rivals from Asia." Mr Stanzione adds that the best business advice he ever received was "keep the organisation lean", and use "small empowered teams". Now the age of a pensioner and married to wife Kaye for almost 45 years, Mr Stanzione says that while he loves spending time with his 10 grandchildren, he has no plans to retire. "To me if you enjoy your work, and I certainly do, then that is you relaxing," he says. "If someone can look at you and not be able to tell if you are working or playing, that is a pretty good place to be." </body>

      <title>Facebook adds alerts to death clips</title>
      <description>Facebook adds warning signs to videos of beheadings and other instances of graphic violence, but its safety advisors still have concerns.</description>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70637000/jpg/_70637328_facebook.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Facebook has begun adding warning messages to videos on its site showing decapitations and other instances of extreme violence. The alert states: "Warning! This video contains extremely graphic content and may be upsetting." The move follows its decision to allow the clips to be posted to its site following a temporary ban on the material, introduced in May. The prime minister and Facebook's own advisors had criticised the decision. The social network said that it wished to allow its users - who can be as young as 13 - to share and condemn the material. It added that it would continue to block clips if the original poster glorified or celebrated the violence shown. On Monday the firm said it might, in time, add warnings or other controls, but initially allowed a recently uploaded decapitation clip to appear unaltered. This prompted David Cameron to tweet: "It's irresponsible of Facebook to post beheading videos, especially without a warning. They must explain their actions to worried parents." US charity the Family Online Safety Institute - a member of the social network's Safety Advisory Board - also raised concern saying it had not been alerted to the change of policy despite previously stating such videos "crossed the line". A spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment about its latest move. She had previously defended its decision to allow a video showing a woman being beheaded - believed to have been filmed in Mexico - to be shared despite the fact it bans images and videos showing a woman's "fully exposed breast". "Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences, particularly when they're connected to controversial events on the ground, such as human rights abuses, acts of terrorism and other violent events," she said. "People are sharing this video on Facebook to condemn it. If the video were being celebrated, or the actions in it encouraged, our approach would be different." A UK member of Facebook's Safety Advisory Board said he still had concerns despite the addition of the warnings. "It's a step forward but it's still horrific content," said Will Gardner, chief executive of Childnet. He added that he needed to look into the changes before commenting further. Until Monday Facebook had also featured adverts alongside the video of the Mexican murder despite the fact several users had complained to it about the material. Car-sharing firm Zipcar, whose service was one of those shown, said it was disappointed by the discovery. "We want you to know that we do not condone this type of abhorrent content being circulated on Facebook," it said in a statement. "We have expressed to Facebook in the past the critical need to block offensive content from appearing and we will continue to engage with them on this important matter." Facebook has since disabled Zipcar and other firms' ads from appearing on the page in question. One of the Facebook accounts that had requested the death video be removed belongs to the South Australia Police force (Sapol). It said it had been contacted by a member of its local community about the matter. Shelaye Boothey, director of Sapol's media and public engagement section, told the BBC: "Ultimately this is a decision that Facebook is entitled to make, however anyone concerned with the publishing of the video should continue to express their concerns through the appropriate Facebook channels." Hostage UK - a charity that supports kidnap victims and their families - added that it was also urging Facebook to reconsider its decision. "We know first-hand the acute distress these videos and images cause and we stress that this continues to be a source of worry to the families of today's hostages," it said. "We can see no useful purpose being served by the decision to make such recordings available. The public are well aware of the brutalities committed and a public showing of such material adds nothing, other than cause further unimaginable suffering." However, some freedom of speech campaigners believe that Facebook should not block the videos, even if they do celebrate the violence contained. French digital rights group La Quadrature Du Net described the actions as "privatised censorship". "It plays a profoundly anti-democratic role when it makes any such choice, whatever the limits are and whatever the good reasons it uses to make the decision," said the organisation's co-founder Jeremie Zimmermann. </body>

      <title>Apple shows off thinner iPad Air</title>
      <description>Apple shows off a new thinner top-of-the range iPad, which it says is lighter than any other full-sized tablet on the market.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24629711</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70645000/png/_70645910_air.png</thumbnail>
      <body>Apple has unveiled a top-of-the-range tablet called the iPad Air that is 20% thinner than the previous version. The 9.7in (24.6cm) computer is 7.5mm (0.3in) thick and weighs 1lb (469g), which the firm claims is the lightest full-sized tablet on the market. It is powered by the same A7 chip found in the company's iPhone 5S. The launch comes at a time when some analysts have suggested that Google's Android is about to overtake Apple's iOS as the bestselling tablet platform. Apple also announced a new version of its iPad Mini. Its 7.9in (20cm) screen has been upgraded to feature 2048 by 1536 pixels - the same as the larger model. It is being branded as "retina" to highlight the increased resolution. Amazon and Google have already announced small tablets - the Kindle Fire HDX and Nexus 7 - with similar high definition displays. "We've got the retina upgrade to the smaller iPad that many thought should have been there in the first place," Tony Cripps, principal analyst at tech consultants Ovum, reflected after the announcement in San Francisco. "Market share slip is inevitable because so many rival devices are coming out, which is not necessarily a bad thing as the overall sector is growing. "Apple does now have a cheaper model thanks to it offering the original iPad Mini at a lower price - but the firm doesn't really want to go to the low-end because that's not where the greatest profit is extracted." Apple also announced that the latest version of its Mac operating system, Mavericks, would be offered at no cost to owners of any compatible computer. It is the first time the company has not charged for a major Mac OS upgrade. By contrast the full version of Windows 8.1 is sold for about £100, although it is free to existing Windows 8 users. Linux-based Ubuntu has always been offered without charge. New laptops, productivity and leisure apps were also unveiled. However, Apple did not show off a new TV set-top box as some had speculated. The California-based firm's most recent financial release said that its iPad range accounted for $25.8bn (£17.6bn) worth of sales in the nine months leading up to July. That represented 19% of its revenue for the period. However, Apple acknowledged that the amount of money it was making from the product line was growing three times slower than the growth in unit sales since many customers were opting for its cheaper iPad Mini and iPad 2 models rather than its top-of-the -range "retina display" versions. It also faces the fact it is losing market share to rivals. Apple's iOS operating system accounted for 53.9% of all tablets shipped in 2012, according to Gartner. The tech research firm forecasts that Android will become the market leader with a 49.6% share, versus Apple's 48.6% this year, adding that it expects that gap to widen further in 2014. However, consultants at IHS iSuppli said those figures needed to be put in context thanks to Apple's success at making money by taking a cut of app sales. "It is in terms of revenue per active device where Apple's lead is strongest," said the firm's mobile media analyst Jack Kent. "An iOS device generates around three to four times as much app revenue through Apple's App Store as an Android device through Google Play. "Apple has so far offered a more compelling range of tablet-specific content, but Google is clearly looking to address this." He added that many Android tablets, including Amazon's Kindle and most products sold in China, did not have Google's store pre-installed. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook noted there were now 475,000 apps designed for iPads available through its online marketplace. But another market watcher suggested that Apple's priority remained securing a "premium" margin on the shop price of its hardware, and that add-on software sales were of secondary interest. "Some players, like Amazon, can afford to slash prices because they have a different business model based on content and commerce," said Thomas Husson, from the tech industry analysts Forrester. "While Apple has shared $13bn to developers since 2008, it has made less than $6bn out of apps. "It's a huge stat, but low in comparison with Apple's quarterly results." </body>

      <title>Nokia reveals phablets and tablets</title>
      <description>Two Windows Phone phablets and a Windows RT tablet are among the final devices unveiled by Nokia ahead of the sale of its hardware unit to Microsoft.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24608498</url>
      <date>1382455107</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70623000/jpg/_70623410_noka.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Nokia has unveiled its first phablets - extra-large phones - as well as its first tablet computer. The Windows Phone handsets introduce the ability to change which objects in a photo are in focus after it is taken. The Windows RT tablet has a 4G data chip, unlike Microsoft's recently unveiled Surface 2. Nokia World in Abu Dhabi is likely to be remembered as the Finnish firm's last major event before it completes the sale of its hardware unit. Microsoft agreed to buy the business for 5.4bn euros ($7.4bn; £4.6bn) in a deal which the companies have said should be finalised by early 2014. Nokia's former chief executive Stephen Elop, who resigned to become head of the company's devices and services division until his transfer to Microsoft, admitted to the BBC that choosing Windows Phone rather than Android as an operating system had presented the company with "a very difficult challenge." "It's been hard. It's a very difficult challenge; it's a very competitive environment, but we're pleased with the fact that we're building momentum," he said. One analyst said the sale should aid the US firm's efforts to promote its mobile platforms against the market leaders, Google Android and Apple iOS. "For the last two years Microsoft and Nokia's marketing efforts have jarred against each other at times - having one big effort should be better than two smaller ones," said Martin Garner, from the consultancy CCS Insight. "Microsoft can also spend a lot more marketing the devices than Nokia could. That does seem to be a key criteria - both Samsung and Apple's spends are very high indeed." Microsoft's share of the handset and tablet markets is growing but from a relatively low level, according to market research firm Gartner. Windows Phone took a 3.3% share of smartphone sales in the April-to-June quarter, said the firm, with Nokia proving the most popular brand. It also forecast that about 1.7% of all tablets shipped over 2013 as a whole would be powered by either Windows RT or the full Windows 8 operating system. Nokia showed off two phablets at the UAE launch. Both the Lumia 1520 and Lumia 1320 feature 6in (15.2cm) displays, allowing extra rows of apps to be displayed on their home screens than possible on smaller models. The firm said that the extra space would also make it easier to use the phones' touchscreen keyboards, suggesting this would appeal to business users who used productivity software. A new Beamer app will allow the phones to stream the contents of their screens onto to a web browser on a separate display. It works by sending data via Nokia's computer servers. Another new app - Refocus - lets owners determine which parts of a photograph are in focus and which are blurred after it is taken. The phones achieve this by taking a series of images in quick succession at different focus lengths rather than replicating the light field effect captured by a Lytro camera. Blackberry is among the other companies to have recently launched a phablet, but one expert said doubts about the Canadian firm's future meant that its existing users might be tempted to switch. "There's definitely a chance for Nokia to gain ground, of course everyone else is interested in that space too," said Mr Garner. "It's not a slam dunk, but Microsoft is as well placed as others - better in some respects." The Lumia 2520 becomes the only Windows RT tablet made by a manufacturer other than Microsoft. Dell, Asus, Lenovo, Acer and Samsung had all initially backed the platform only to later change tack. The operating system runs on an ARM-based chip allowing it to offer superior battery life to the full Windows 8 system running on tablets powered by x86 processors, but it does not support as many programs. Nokia's tablet is slightly more compact than Microsoft's version and also distinguishes itself by supporting an optional 4G Sim card. However, bearing in mind Microsoft has already taken a $900m writedown after weak sales of its original Surface RT tablet, one analyst questioned whether the firm would want to produce two competing models. "I don't think that having two devices in that space makes a lot of sense," said Carolina Milanesi, consumer devices analyst at Gartner. "I believe Microsoft may keep the Nokia model on as a cheaper consumer-targeted device focused on media consumption and gaming in order to capture more market share, and also keep on the more expensive Intel-based Surface Pro - but it will phase out the Surface 2 RT model." Nokia also added three models to its Asha range of low-end handsets targeted at emerging markets and shoppers on a budget. They run Nokia's proprietary Series 40 OS rather than Windows Phone. The most expensive of the devices, the Asha 530, now supports 3G data in addition to 2G, allowing faster internet access. "It's important for Nokia and Microsoft to connect the next billion people," said Mr Elop, suggesting that Microsoft would find Asha's popularity a convenient way to promote other services such as its Skydrive cloud storage product. But one market watcher questioned Asha's future. "There's still quite a lot of demand for Asha in developing markets where the phones offer brand-value against other low-cost mass-market handsets," said Chris Green from the Davies Murphy Group consultancy. "So, there's no sense to killing the business while it remains highly profitable. "But will it be a core focus? Absolutely not. It will be a distraction and Microsoft will be keen to migrate users to the Windows Phone platform." </body>

      <title>Critics dismiss new data legislation</title>
      <description>Major new European data-protection laws may have serious loopholes, say critics.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24622919</url>

      <body>Critics have said new European data-protection laws have loopholes that could render the legislation useless. The rules are the first attempt to create strong data-protection laws for Europe's 500 million citizens. They include a clause to strengthen online privacy in the wake of whistleblower Edward Snowden's allegations about US spying. They also set out ways citizens can erase their personal data - the so-called right to be forgotten. Lawmakers have toughened the initial draft regulation, prepared by the European Commission, to make sure companies no longer share European citizens' data with authorities of another country, unless explicitly allowed by EU law or an international treaty. This is a direct response to allegations from former intelligence analyst Edward Snowden about the US National Security Agency (NSA) snooping on European citizens' data. Another clause seeks to limit user profiling, requiring companies to explain their use of personal data in detail to customers and to seek prior consent. To ensure that the regulation is properly applied, most businesses would have to designate or hire data-protection officers. After 18 months of fierce industry lobbying, the legislation was passed with a 49-3 committee vote, with one abstention. The European Parliament still needs to hold another vote and seek agreement with the EU's 28 member states though — which is likely to result in some changes. "Tonight's vote sends a clear signal - as of today, data protection is made in Europe," said EU justice commissioner Viviane Reding. But French consumer group La Quadrature du Net was disappointed with the draft law. "There are some big loopholes that could void the effectiveness of the whole legislation," said Jeremie Zimmermann, from the organisation. He said vague wording such as "legitimate interest" could allow businesses to "exonerate themselves from the legislation". "A business could say that it is a legitimate interest to collect data in order to provide a better service for consumers or to enable it to make money," he said. He was also surprised that the rules around data profiling were not tougher. "Machines that crunch data are used to make important decisions such as who can get a job, who can get a loan, who can get insurance," he said. "This legislation allows firms to continue to collect and process more data and profile individuals." Bridget Treacy, partner and head of UK privacy and cyber-security at law firm, Hunton and Williams thinks that companies will have to ring the changes in order to comply with the legislation. "It enhances consumer rights and means businesses are going to have to focus on making sure they know what data they've got and what they do with it," she said. "One of the requirements of the legislation is that companies only collect the minimum amount of data that they require for a specific purpose. Firms are going to have to be much clearer about what data they are collecting and why." "It means that they will not be able to hold on to data as a bit of a comfort blanket," she added. Companies that fail to comply with the new law could be subject to a fine of up to 5% of their annual turnover — which could be hundreds of millions of dollars, or even a few billion dollars for internet giants such as Google. Now begins a long process during which the approved legislation will be debated among between the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council. It is expected to be concluded in March. </body>

      <title>US agency 'hacked French diplomats'</title>
      <description>New revelations in Le Monde newspaper allege the US National Security Agency spied on French diplomats in Washington and at the UN.</description>

      <body>The US National Security Agency has spied on French diplomats in Washington and at the UN, according to the latest claims in Le Monde newspaper. NSA internal memos obtained by Le Monde detailed the use of a sophisticated surveillance programme, known as Genie. US spies allegedly hacked foreign networks, introducing the spyware into the software, routers and firewalls of millions of machines. It comes a day after claims the NSA tapped millions of phones in France. The details in the latest Le Monde article are based on leaks from ex-intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, through Glen Greenwald, the outgoing Guardian journalist, who is feeding the material from Brazil, says the BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris. It comes on the day the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, is in London meeting foreign counterparts to discuss Syria. The Le Monde report sets out details of Genie, an NSA surveillance programme in which spyware implants were introduced remotely to overseas computers, including foreign embassies. It claims bugs were introduced to the French Embassy in Washington (under a code name "Wabash") and to the computers of the French delegation at the UN, codenamed "Blackfoot". The article suggests that in 2011, the US allocated $652m (£402m) in funding for the programme, which was spent on "spy implants". Tens of millions of computers were reported to have been hacked that year. A document dated August 2010 suggests intelligence stolen from foreign embassy computers ensured the US knew ahead of time the positions of other Security Council members, before a UN vote for a resolution imposing new sanctions on Iran. The US was worried the French were drifting to the Brazilian side - who were opposed to implementing sanctions - when in truth they were always aligned to the US position, says our correspondent. The intelligence agency quotes Susan Rice, then-US ambassador to the UN, who praises the work done by the NSA: "It helped me know... the truth, and reveal other [countries'] positions on sanctions, allowing us to keep one step ahead in the negotiations." On Monday, Le Monde alleged that the NSA spied on 70.3 million phone calls in France between 10 December 2012 and 8 January 2013. At a breakfast meeting with the US secretary of state on Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius demanded a full explanation. Referring to a telephone call between the French and US presidents, Mr Fabius told reporters: "I said again to John Kerry what Francois Hollande told Barack Obama, that this kind of spying conducted on a large scale by the Americans on its allies is something that is unacceptable." Asked if France was considering reprisals against the US, government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem replied: "It is up to Foreign Minister Fabius to decide what line we take but I don't think there is any need for an escalation. "We have to have a respectful relationship between partners, between allies. Our confidence in that has been hit but it is after all a very close, individual relationship that we have." Both French officials made their comments before the latest revelations appeared in Le Monde. Mr Snowden, a former NSA worker, went public with revelations about US spying operations in June. The information he leaked led to claims of systematic spying by the NSA and CIA on a global scale. Targets included rivals like China and Russia, as well as allies like the EU and Brazil. The NSA was also forced to admit it had captured email and phone data from millions of Americans. Mr Snowden is currently in Russia, where he was granted a year-long visa after making an asylum application. The US wants him extradited to face trial on criminal charges. </body>

      <title>Blackberry resumes BBM rollout</title>
      <description>Blackberry announces it is resuming the rollout of its BBM messaging app for Android and iPhone after September's botched launch.</description>

      <body>Blackberry has resumed a phased rollout of its BBM messaging app for Android and Apple devices after September's botched launch. The free app is now available for download on Google Play, the App Store and selected Samsung App Stores. But users had to register an email address after downloading the app then wait in line until they were told they could begin using it, Blackberry said. Last month Blackberry had to delay the launch after the software was leaked. The company said that "in just seven hours [following the leak], about one million Android users were using the unreleased version of BBM for Android". This had caused unspecified "issues" for the launch, it said. About six million people had signed up for information abut BBM at BBM.com, the company said. "To help manage this unprecedented pent-up demand for BBM, we are implementing a simple line-up system to ensure a smooth rollout," wrote company spokesman Andrew Bocking. Those who had already signed up for information about BBM were able to start using the app straight away, he said. Others would have to wait in line, but the company did not specify how long the wait might be. The botched launch was the latest in a run of bad news for the struggling Canadian firm, which is cutting 4,500 jobs, made a net loss of $965m (£600m) in the second quarter of 2013, and has agreed a $4.7bn sale to a consortium led by Fairfax Financial. Blackberry has failed to keep pace with Apple and devices running Google Android or Microsoft's Windows Phone operating systems. In September, there were reports that it was exiting the consumer market to concentrate on providing services to business customers - reports it has since played down. But the Blackberry Messenger product - known as BBM - has proved very popular, particularly with younger users. The software offers an alternative to SMS messages - which cost money on some subscription plans - as well as other voice and screen-sharing capabilities. </body>

      <title>Cyber defence unit 'may use hackers'</title>
      <description>Convicted computer hackers could be recruited to the UK's cyber defence force if they pass security vetting, says the head of the new unit.</description>

      <body>Convicted computer hackers could be recruited to the UK's cyber defence force if they pass security vetting, the head of the new unit has said. Lt Col Michael White told BBC Newsnight he would "look at individuals in the round" when assessing applicants. Recruitment would be focused on "capability development" rather than "personality traits", he added. The Joint Cyber Reserve Unit was announced by the government in September. Under the £500m initiative, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) is set to recruit hundreds of reservists as computer experts to work alongside regular armed forces. The unit will defend national security by safeguarding computer networks and vital data, and it will also launch strikes in cyberspace if necessary. It is hoped the move will address the shortage of people with the technological skills and knowledge to protect corporations, the military, and government systems from cyber attacks. The MoD said the recruitment, which started in early October, would target regular personnel leaving the armed forces, current and former reservists with the required skills, and civilians with the appropriate technological knowledge. When asked by Newsnight whether someone with the right skills would be ruled out if they had a criminal record for hacking, Lt Col White said: "I think if they could get through the security process, then if they had that capability that we would like, then if the vetting authority was happy with that, why not? "We're looking at capability development, rather than setting hard and fast rules about individual personality traits." Defence Secretary Philip Hammond unveiled plans for the cyber defence unit last month. Mr Hammond also told Newsnight he could foresee circumstances in which convicted hackers could be employed. "Each individual case would be looked at on its merits," he said. "The conviction would be examined in terms of how long ago it was, how serious it was, what sort of sentence had followed. So I can't rule it out." But one former hacker told Newsnight the government had already undermined its chances of attracting talented individuals. Mustafa al-Bassam, now a computer science student at King's College London, was the youngest hacker in the Lulzsec group - which recently targeted organisations such as the FBI in the US and Britain's Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) in a 50-day hacking campaign. He told the BBC that revelations by former US contractor Edward Snowden about the extent of mass surveillance carried out by intelligence agencies - including the US' National Security Agency (NSA) and Britain's GCHQ - had dissuaded him from using his cyber skills to protect UK national security. "I can understand the need for a government to protect itself, but when you go ahead and stomp on everyone's civil liberties - as we've seen with all the mass surveillance stories that have been out over the past year - I think you can rest assured that you're going to repel talented people," he said. Dr David Day, a Sheffield Hallam University computer forensics expert who provided evidence for Mr Al-Bassam's conviction, told Newsnight it was a "terrible shame" someone convicted of malicious hacking would find it difficult to get a job in the industry. "If they have those abilities and those skills, then some of the best talent we can't use," he said. Cyber attacks and crime have become more common in recent years. In July, it emerged Britain was seeing about 70 sophisticated cyber espionage operations a month against government or industry networks, GCHQ director Sir Iain Lobban told the BBC business secrets were being stolen on an "industrial scale". And in a written statement in December last year, Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude said 93% of large corporations and 76% of small businesses had reported a cyber breach in 2012.

      <title>Wikipedia in fake entries probe</title>
      <description>Editors of the English-language Wikipedia site express "shock and dismay" at the discovery of hundreds of paid-for entries.</description>

      <body>Wikipedia editors have expressed "shock and dismay" at the discovery of hundreds of user accounts set up to make paid-for entries. Paid-for advocacy and the adoption of fake "sockpuppet" identities for promotional purposes are against the free web encyclopaedia's policies. Sue Gardner, executive editor of the Wikimedia Foundation, said "as many as several hundred" accounts were suspect. Editors have blocked or banned more than 250 accounts, she added. "Our goal is to provide neutral, reliable information for our readers, and anything that threatens that is a serious problem," said Ms Gardner. "We are actively examining this situation and exploring our options." Wikipedia considers paid-for advocacy a "black hat" practice, she said, that "violates the core principles that have made Wikipedia so valuable for so many people." The Wikimedia Foundation is a non-profit organisation that operates Wikipedia, a free online encyclopaedia. According to investigations by the service's editors, most of the disputed entries appear to originate from a US company called Wiki-PR, which claims to "build, manage, and translate Wikipedia pages for over 12,000 people and companies." The editors say promotional entries - which were posted by an account called "Morning227" as well as by others - have been commissioned by Silicon Valley dot-coms, small financial institutions, authors, medical doctors, a musician and an oil company, amongst others. Citations are taken from a number of blog-like websites that accept "citizen journalist" material, including CrunchBase, DigitalJournal.com and Technorati.com. Entries "often have a promotional tone and always contain material that is either neutral or that is flattering of their subjects, never material that is critical or negative," Wikipedia said. However, Wiki-PR disputed the idea it had broken Wikipedia's rules by promoting or advertising its clients' agendas, saying it merely wanted to ensure they were "presented accurately" on the site. "The PR in Wiki-PR is a misnomer - we're a research and writing firm," Jordan French, the firm's chief executive, told the BBC. "We research the subject and write in an accurate and properly referenced way about it, filling a hole at Wikipedia for many subjects - concepts, companies, people, even astronomy - in which other editors lack an interest. "We're part of the fabric of Wikipedia - an integral part - and useful where volunteers don't want to or cannot put in the time to understand a subject, find sources, code, upload, and professionally monitor a page.

      <title>Obama addresses healthcare glitches</title>
      <description>President Barack Obama acknowledges widespread technical issues that have plagued the rollout of a major element of his 2010 healthcare law.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24613022</url>

      <body>US President Barack Obama has said there is "no excuse" for the glitches that have plagued the rollout of an element of his 2010 healthcare law. At the White House, Mr Obama said that despite their problems, the insurance enrolment websites were enabling people to sign up for affordable coverage. Those attempting to sign up for health insurance have reported persistent issues since the 1 October rollout. Mr Obama said a "tech surge" was under way to fix the snags. The website's issues have been overshadowed by the recent partial government shutdown, in which Republican lawmakers attempted to gut the law through budgetary brinkmanship. 'No sugar coating' In Monday's Rose Garden event, Mr Obama conceded that healthcare.gov "hasn't worked as smoothly as it was supposed to work". "The number of people who've visited the site has been overwhelming, which has aggravated some of these underlying problems." Mr Obama added: "There's no sugar coating - the website has been too slow, people have been getting stuck during the application process and I think it's fair to say that nobody's more frustrated by that than I am." He said that notwithstanding the website's problems, there was "massive demand" and the homepage had been visited nearly 20 million times since its launch. "Precisely because the product is good, I want the cash registers to work; I want the checkout lines to be smooth," said Mr Obama. "And there's no excuse for the problems, and these problems are getting fixed." He was joined at Monday's event by people who have successfully enrolled during the first three weeks. Janice Baker, a Delaware business owner who was the first person in her state to enrol for coverage through the exchange website, introduced Mr Obama. She said she had "a number of frustrating attempts" to use the site, but kept trying as she had been rejected from insurance plans previously because of a pre-existing condition. Ms Baker said she expected to save $150 (£93) a month with the policy she had signed up for on the exchange. The website is supposed to be a clearinghouse for uninsured Americans searching for medical coverage. The site acts both as a check on whether applications qualify for government subsidies for private insurance, as well as being the first enrolment step for specific plans. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projects the exchanges will be the gateway for providing health coverage to an estimated seven million Americans during the first year. The White House has said almost half a million people have applied for healthcare through both federal and state-run exchanges since 1 October. Exchanges run by individual states do not appear to have been plagued to the same extent by malfunctions. White House officials initially blamed the glitches on the heavy volume of visits to the site, but they recently conceded the flaws were larger and involved software and system design issues. The Department of Health and Human Services, which runs the exchanges, said in a blog post it had already begun to make improvements. But the administration has offered few details on who was being brought in from outside the government and the specific causes of the ongoing glitches. Passed in 2010, the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, has rolled out in multiple steps, including coverage requirements on insurance companies and future tax penalties for those who remain uninsured. Republicans unanimously oppose the law and have worked to undermine it since it was enacted. Republican-led state governments have used their authority to frustrate its implementation. Republicans in Congress have repeatedly attempted to repeal the law or eliminate its funding, most recently by refusing to pass a budget in an attempt to force Mr Obama's hand. A subsequent 16-day shutdown of the federal government ended with no major concessions from Mr Obama. "Obamacare costs too much and it's not working the way they promised," Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday. "It's time for the president to consider delaying this rushed effort." Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has also been criticised by Republican lawmakers for declining an invitation to testify about the snags on 24 October. But a spokeswoman for the health department said the secretary would testify at some point. White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Monday there had been "for many months and years now a concentrated, concerted effort by critics of Obamacare to undermine it". "There's clearly some joy being taken in some quarters by the experiences that some Americans have had, frustrating experiences that they've had, in trying to get information about affordable health insurance." Although the law remains divisive, a recent Gallup poll suggests only 29% of the public favours a complete repeal. </body>

      <title>Windows 8.1 glitch hits RT owners</title>
      <description>The latest Windows update is causing problems for owners of Microsoft's Surface RT gadgets.</description>

      <body>The latest Windows update is causing problems for owners of Microsoft's Surface RT gadgets. The Windows 8.1 update has reportedly meant some of the touchscreen devices will not start up properly. Microsoft has removed the update from its website while it looks into what has caused the problems. At the same time, many people are reporting that the 8.1 update for Internet Explorer does not work well with Outlook and some Google services. Soon after the update's global release, on 17 October, Microsoft started to receive reports that once it had been applied to RT tablets and laptops, the gadgets had frozen during the boot-up process. Windows RT is the version of Microsoft's operating system built to work with mobile and portable devices that use Arm chips. By contrast, other version of Windows run on machines that use processors from Intel or AMD. Soon after the problems were reported, Microsoft pulled Windows RT 8.1 from its update site. The update was pulled while it was "investigating a situation affecting a limited number of users", it explained in a support forum response. It added that it was working on a fix for the problem it had caused. Prior to the official release, Windows RT user Scott Williams found a way to help people with tablets crippled by the update. Mr Williams created a start-up drive with a USB stick that helped bring stricken RT gadgets back to life. The version of Internet Explorer 11 that ships with Windows 8.1 update has also caused problems for many people. The updated version of the web browser has caused Google search results to be mashed together at the left hand side of a display. Others have reported IE11 has caused similar usability problems with Google's Play website and Music service. In a statement, Microsoft said changes Google had made to its search and other sites were responsible for the glitches. Despite this, Microsoft has now made changes of its own to fix the problem, which can be turned on by unticking an option in IE11 that makes the browser use "Microsoft Compatibility lists". Microsoft has also issued advice about how to get IE11 working with web-accessible versions of its Outlook email program that had become unusable with the new version of the browser. </body>

      <title>Cheney: Heart implant hack credible</title>
      <description>Dick Cheney, the former US vice-president, reveals that he had his wireless heart implant modified for fear of terrorist attack back in 2007.</description>

      <body>Dick Cheney, the former US vice-president, has revealed that he had his heart implant modified for fear of terrorist attack. Mr Cheney's doctor disabled the heart defibrillator's wireless function in 2007 to prevent would-be assassins from interfering with it and causing a fatal heart attack. A similar scenario featured in an episode of the hit TV series Homeland. "I found it credible," Mr Cheney told CBS TV's 60 Minutes programme. "I know from the experience we had, and the necessity for adjusting my own device, that it was an accurate portrayal of what was possible,'' said Mr Cheney, who was President George W Bush's right-hand man during the "war on terror". "Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) can be vulnerable to a range of electronic signals," said Adrian Culley, global technical consultant for security company Damballa. "Research has been undertaken which shows it is entirely feasible to potentially exploit someone's ICD, given close proximity to the individual." But he said the chance of a successful attack on Mr Cheney would have been "slim". An ICD monitors heartbeat and if it detects an irregular rhythm, sends low-energy electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. In 2008, researchers from the University of Washington, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Harvard Medical School, claimed that they could carry out software radio-based attacks on ICDs that could "compromise patient safety and patient privacy". More recent research has also highlighted the security and data privacy weaknesses of some implantable medical devices. "Since the experiments in 2008, experts have acknowledged that greater security of these devices is required, and encryption has been introduced to prevent the loss of personal data," a spokesman for the Institute of Risk Management told the BBC. "As with all electronic devices, the possibility of targeted hacking still exists given the right physical situation, expert knowledge of the device and the necessary equipment. "However, it is much more likely that a strong electromagnetic field will cause the device to malfunction," he said. The American Heart Association warns ICD users against too much close-range exposure to a number of electronic devices, from mobile phones to metal detectors, retail security systems to powerful CB radios. But it points out that, in most cases, the risks are small. Cardiologist Jonathan Reiner has co-written a book with Mr Cheney called, Heart: An American Medical Odyssey, chronicling the former vice-president's many heart problems. Mr Reiner told 60 Minutes that on 11 September 2001, the day of the al-Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington, the potassium in Mr Cheney's blood rose to levels that could have caused abnormal heart rhythms and cardiac arrest - a condition called hyperkalemia. Mr Reiner feared the vice-president was going to die that night. Mr Cheney, 72, has a long history of heart troubles culminating in a heart transplant last year. </body>

      <body>A browser-based re-creation of the popular Super Mario Brothers console game has fallen foul of Nintendo's copyright lawyers, The Washington Post has reported. College student Josh Goldberg created the Full Screen Mario site in HTML 5 so people could play the game in a web browser rather than on a games console. But Nintendo has asked him to remove the content saying it infringes its "intellectual property rights". The game is still operational. Mr Goldberg, who admitted he did not get permission from Nintendo to re-create the game, said he began the project in October 2012 as a computer programming exercise. He "didn't care" about copyright issues because he "didn't think it would be a big project", he told the newspaper. But after little initial interest the game is now receiving 300,000 unique visitors a day, Mr Goldberg claims, after Boing Boing's Cory Doctorow blogged about it. Unfortunately for Mr Goldberg, the site's popularity also brought it to the attention of Nintendo's lawyers. "Nintendo's like Disney - it will not tolerate their characters being used on anything," said Keza MacDonald, UK games editor for IGN.com, the video game and entertainment site. "Earlier this year Nintendo stopped people posting footage of their games on YouTube, so this behaviour sounds entirely consistent." At the bottom of the site's home page the site declares: "Mario, Super Mario Brothers, and all associated games and media are property of Nintendo and/or Nintendo of America Inc., and are protected by United States and international copyright, trademark and other intellectual property laws." Super Mario Brothers was copyrighted by Nintendo in 1985, but under US law, corporate copyright lasts for 95 years. </body>

      <title>Youngsters taking 'risks' online</title>
      <description>Many nine-to-11-year-old children are indulging in 'very risky behaviour online', a web safety survey suggests.</description>

      <body>Many children aged nine to 11 are indulging in very risky behaviour online, suggests a survey. Many are sharing personal information and playing games rated for much older children, found the survey drawn up by the ISC2 IT security education group. In addition, 18% of the 1,162 children queried said they had arranged offline meetings with friends made via the web. Meanwhile, a second survey suggests 55% of young people in England accept cyberbullying as part of everyday life. Security experts have urged parents to help their offspring stay safe by being more involved with what they do online. "[Many] primary school children know far more about the internet than their parents do," said Tim Wilson, an information security worker who carried out the survey for the ISC2 organisation which helps schools educate children about web safety. In total, 15 schools in south-east London, Kent and Guernsey took part in the survey. "Youngsters actually participate in a lot of risky behaviours that I don't believe the parents know about," he said. "Not because of any ill will on behalf of the parents, it's just that the parents do not understand technology." The survey exposed the amount of time that younger children were spending online and what they got up to. It found that 43% went online every day and 46% spent more than two hours each time they browsed. Many (22%) regularly used it after 21:00 and a small percentage, 7%, were still online after midnight. Some reported that their concentration in class had suffered as a result of their late night activity. The most popular online activities were playing video games (23%), using social networks (18%) and watching videos (17%). Of the 19% who said they played war games online, a significant number said they played age inappropriate titles such as the 18-rated Black Ops and Modern Warfare. The time children spent online and the activities they indulged in was putting them at risk, said Mr Wilson. A significant proportion of children who answered the survey, 18%, said they had met in real life friends they had made online. Although a majority took along an adult or older sibling to these meetings, a third said they just went along with friends. Dr Elizabeth Staksrud, from Oslo University, an expert on children's use of the web who advises the EU Kids Online project, said most face-face meetings with online friends were positive experiences for children. "It's rare that such meetings are associated with abuse," she said, adding the caveat that parents often did not know that such a meeting had taken place. However, she added that, in a small number of cases where grooming was taking place, it was often not immediately apparent to a child that their online friends could present a threat. Mr Wilson echoed this comment and said younger children were not applying the real world rules that kept them safe, such as being wary of strangers, when they went online. "They are very knowledgeable but they do not have the adult life skills to understand what is risky ," he said. Nickie Forrest, head teacher at Normandy Primary School in Bexley, said parents should be doing more to help their children understand the risks and stay safe. "Parents have to start taking responsibility for a world perhaps that they don't understand," said Ms Forrest. In the second survey, commissioned by the Anti-Bullying Alliance, 60.5% of parents said that cyberbullying had become part of life for children and young people. But 40% of parents and 44% of the teachers surveyed acknowledged that they did not know how to respond to cyberbullying. The survey of 2,200 parents, children and teachers across England revealed growing calls for online safety to be taught in more schools, with 69% of teachers and 40% of young people saying it should be included in the national curriculum. Luke Roberts, national co-ordinator of the Anti-Bullying Alliance, said cyberbullying is one of the biggest issues facing young people today and called for the government, parents and social networking sites to come together to teach young people how to stay safe online. "We need a collaborative approach to tackling cyberbullying, so children themselves can take responsibility for their own safety online and know where to turn for help when things go wrong," he said. </body>

      <title>French outrage over US spying claims</title>
      <description>France summons the US ambassador over claims in Le Monde newspaper that the US routinely spied on millions of phone calls in France.</description>

      <body>France's foreign ministry has summoned the US ambassador over allegations the US National Security Agency spied on millions of phone calls in France. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said he was "deeply shocked" by the claims made in the Le Monde newspaper. The data, based on leaks from ex-intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, suggest the NSA monitored officials and businesses as well as terror suspects. The White House said "all nations" conducted spying operations. "As a matter of policy we have made clear that the United States gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations," said National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden. Le Monde says the NSA spied on 70.3 million phone calls in France in just 30 days between 10 December last year and 8 January 2013. The intercepts were apparently triggered by certain key words. The agency also apparently captured millions of text messages. It was unclear whether the content of the calls and messages was stored, or just the metadata - the details of who was speaking to whom. And the paper did not say whether the operation, codenamed US-985D, was still in progress. Prime Minister Ayrault said: "It's incredible that an allied country like the United States at this point goes as far as spying on private communications that have no strategic justification, no justification on the basis of national defence." The US embassy in Paris said in a statement: "The ambassador [Charles Rivkin] expressed his appreciation of the importance of the exchange, and promised to convey the points made back to Washington." Mr Rivkin assured Alexandre Ziegler, chief-of-staff to Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, that "our ongoing bilateral consultations on allegations of information gathering by US government agencies would continue," the statement said. The BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris says the outrage is largely for public consumption, because the French government has been accused of running its own snooping operation similar to the US. Le Monde reported in July that the French government was storing vast amounts of personal data of its citizens on a supercomputer at the headquarters of the DGSE intelligence service. Connections inside France and between France and other countries were all monitored, Le Monde reported. Emails, text messages, telephone and internet browsing records are stored for years, it said. The latest revelations follow claims in the German media that US agents hacked into the email account of former Mexican President Felipe Calderon. Mr Snowden, a former NSA worker, went public with revelations about US spying operations in June. The information he leaked led to claims of systematic spying by the NSA and CIA on a global scale. Targets included rivals like China and Russia, as well as allies like the EU and Brazil. The NSA was also forced to admit it had captured email and phone data from millions of Americans. Mr Snowden is currently in Russia, where he was granted a year-long visa after making an asylum application. The US wants him extradited to face trial on criminal charges. </body>

      <title>Major piracy site to be shut down</title>
      <description>IsoHunt, a major website that indexed illegal files, is to close and pay $110m (£68m) to a US movie industry body.</description>

      <body>IsoHunt, a popular website offering BitTorrents of mostly pirated material, is to shut down following a court settlement. The site's owner, Canadian Gary Fung, has agreed to pay $110m (£68m) to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). MPAA chairman Chris Dodd said the move was a "major step forward" for legitimate commerce online. In a blog post, Mr Fung said: "It's sad to see my baby go." The site is currently still online, but will soon be shut. It is one of the most popular sites of its kind on the internet. A group of companies, including Disney, Paramount and Twentieth Century Fox, accused the site of wilfully infringing copyright by listing millions of popular movies and TV programmes - in a court battle that has lasted for more than seven years. Now Mr Fung has agreed to settle. He added: "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race and I have remained faithful. 10.5 years of IsoHunt has been a long journey by any business definition and forever in internet start-up time. "It started as a programming hobby in my university days that has become so, so much more." Court documents acknowledged that it is unlikely that Mr Fung's company could pay $110m, and that the MPAA would probably receive between $2m and $4m. Like a similar site, The Pirate Bay, that has been blocked in the UK by a court order, IsoHunt did not host pirated material itself. It instead acted as a directory of sources from which to download illegal files. According to court documents, Mr Fung's defence hinged on this degree of separation - and argued that it was the users of IsoHunt responsible for distributing pirated material, not IsoHunt. The Californian court disagreed. "It sends a strong message that those who build businesses around encouraging, enabling, and helping others to commit copyright infringement are themselves infringers, and will be held accountable for their illegal actions," said MPAA chairman Mr Dodd. "The successful outcome of this landmark lawsuit will also will help preserve jobs and protect the tens of thousands of businesses in the creative industries, whose hard work and investments are exploited by sites like IsoHunt." Ahead of the ruling, Mr Fung had taken to social news site Reddit to take part in an AMAA - Ask Me Almost Anything - session. In it, he described himself as a "reluctant revolutionary", and backed calls for copyright reform. He said he did not hold a disregard for the law, and acted upon requests to remove links to pirated content when the company was made aware. He also said the industry could render sites like IsoHunt obsolete if it offered simultaneous releases worldwide, as well as digital offerings that were cheaper than physical copies. His thoughts echoed findings by a trio of researchers at George Mason University in Virginia, US. Their site piracydata.org has been collating the weekly top 10 most-pirated films and investigating whether legal digital methods were available. They found that half of the movies in the list were not available to access legally online. Furthermore, none of the 10 titles could be streamed - arguably the most straightforward way to consume media online. However, in contrast, efforts by Fox to curb piracy of TV series The Walking Dead fell flat. Despite the first episode of the latest series being made available to stream free online, the programme was still illegally downloaded more than 500,000 times, according to data gathered by Torrentfreak.com.

      <body>The creators of legendary adventure game Myst are seeking cash for a new game via Kickstarter. Cyan Worlds is looking for $1.1m (£679,000) from the crowdfunding site to develop a game called Obduction. The game-maker said its new title would be a spiritual successor to its earlier point-and-click adventure games Myst and Riven. If Cyan reaches its funding target it plans to release PC and Mac versions of Obduction in mid-2015. Released in 1993, Myst was a huge hit thanks to its sumptuous look, detailed world-building and intricate puzzles. On its Kickstarter page, Cyan said Obduction would continue with these traditions but update them to take advantage of the power of modern computers. It said the game would use the Unreal 4 game development engine to create a detailed far-flung world that players find themselves upon at the start of the game. Playing Obduction involves exploring the world, solving puzzles and working out why the player has been abducted and taken to the alien planet. The cash being sought was for the most basic version of the game, said Cyan. Cash raised beyond the original total would go towards making the game world bigger and moving the title to other gaming gadgets beyond PCs. Cyan said it was turning to Kickstarter because it allowed the company to connect with fans, meant it had control of development and ensured everyone involved had an intimate link to the project. Nathan Grayson at PC game news website Rock, Paper Shotgun said the "meagre" information provided by Cyan did not give a good idea about how the final game might turn out. He wondered if the game would reach its funding target despite getting pledges of more than $100,000 within a day of being kicked off. "Obduction really does feel like it'd be a shoo-in if it wasn't currently a pile of napkin scrawlings and a series of excited hand gestures," he wrote. </body>

      <title>'Electronic blood' computer tested</title>
      <description>A new brain-inspired computing device powered via a liquid instead of through wires has been demonstrated at IBM's Zurich laboratory.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24571219</url>
      <date>1382115902</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70552000/jpg/_70552415_8549310302_50612fbc36_c.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>IBM has unveiled a prototype of a new brain-inspired computer powered by what it calls "electronic blood". The firm says it is learning from nature by building computers fuelled and cooled by a liquid, like our minds. The human brain packs phenomenal computing power into a tiny space and uses only 20 watts of energy - an efficiency IBM is keen to match. Its new "redox flow" system pumps an electrolyte "blood" through a computer, carrying power in and taking heat out. A very basic model was demonstrated this week at the technology giant's Zurich lab by Dr Patrick Ruch and Dr Bruno Michel. Their vision is that by 2060, a one petaflop computer that would fill half a football field today, will fit on your desktop. "We want to fit a supercomputer inside a sugarcube. To do that, we need a paradigm shift in electronics - we need to be motivated by our brain," says Michel. "The human brain is 10,000 times more dense and efficient than any computer today. "That's possible because it uses only one - extremely efficient - network of capillaries and blood vessels to transport heat and energy - all at the same time." IBM's brainiest computer to date is Watson, which famously trounced two champions of the US TV quiz show Jeopardy. The victory was hailed as a landmark for cognitive computing - machine had surpassed man. But the contest was unfair, says Michel. The brains of Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter ran on only 20 watts of energy, whereas Watson needed 85,000 watts. Energy efficiency - not raw computing power - is the guiding principle for the next generation of computer chips, IBM believes. Our current 2D silicon chips, which for half a century have doubled in power through Moore's Law, are approaching a physical limit where they cannot shrink further without overheating. "The computer industry uses $30bn of energy and throws it out of the window. We're creating hot air for $30bn," says Michel. "Ninety-nine per cent of a computer's volume is devoted to cooling and powering. Only 1% is used to process information. And we think we've built a good computer?" "The brain uses 40% of its volume for functional performance - and only 10% for energy and cooling." Michel's vision is for a new "bionic" computing architecture, inspired by one of the laws of nature - allometric scaling - where an animal's metabolic power increases with its body size. An elephant, for example, weighs as much as a million mice. But it consumes 30 times less energy, and can perform a task even a million mice cannot accomplish. The same principle holds true in computing, says Michel, whose bionic vision has three core design features. The first is 3D architecture, with chips stacked high, and memory storage units interwoven with processors. "It's the difference between a low-rise building, where everything is spread out flat, and a high rise building. You shorten the connection distances," says Matthias Kaiserswerth, director of IBM Zurich. But there is a very good reason today's chips are gridiron pancakes - exposure to the air is critical to dissipate the intense heat generated by ever-smaller transistors. Piling chips on top of one another locks this heat inside - a major roadblock to 3D computing. IBM's solution is integrated liquid cooling - where chips are interlayered with tiny water pipes. The art of liquid cooling has been demonstrated by Aquasar and put to work inside the German supercomputer SuperMUC which - perversely - harnesses warm water to cool its circuits. SuperMUC consumes 40% less electricity as a result. But for IBM to truly match the marvels of the brain, there is a third evolutionary step it must achieve - simultaneous liquid fuelling and cooling. Just as blood gives sugar in one hand and takes heat with another, IBM is looking for a fluid that can multitask. Vanadium is the best performer in their current laboratory test system - a type of redox flow unit - similar to a simple battery. First a liquid - the electrolyte - is charged via electrodes, then pumped into the computer, where it discharges energy to the chip. Redox flow is far from a new technology, and neither is it especially complex. But IBM is the first to stake its chips on this "electronic blood" as the food of future computers - and will attempt to optimise it over the coming decades to achieve zettascale computing. "To power a zettascale computer today would take more electricity than is produced in the entire world," says Michel. He is confident that the design hurdles in his bionic model can be surmounted - not least that a whole additional unit is needed to charge the liquid. And while other labs are betting on spintronics, quantum computing, or photonics to take us beyond silicon, the Zurich team believes the real answer lies right behind our eyes. "Just as computers help us understand our brains, if we understand our brains we'll make better computers," says director Matthias Kaiserswerth. He would like to see a future Watson win Jeopardy on a level playing field. Other experts in computing agree that IBM's 3D principles are sound. But as to whether bionic computing will be the breakthrough technology, the jury is out. "The idea of using a fluid to both power and cool strikes me as very novel engineering - killing two birds with one stone," says Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey's computing department. "But every form of future computing has its champions - whether it be quantum computing, DNA computing or neuromorphic computing. "There is a long way to go from the lab to having one of these sitting under your desk." Prof Steve Furber, leader of the SpiNNaker project agrees that "going into the third dimension" has more to offer than continually shrinking transistors. "The big issue with 3D computing is getting the heat out - and liquid cooling could be very effective if integrated into 3D systems as proposed here," he told the BBC. "But all of the above will not get electronics down to the energy-efficiency of the brain. "That will require many more changes, including a move to analogue computation instead of digital. "It will also involve breakthroughs in new non-Turing models of computation, for example based on an understanding of how the brain processes information." </body>

      <body>Britain's changing weather patterns have resulted in an increase in the number of landslides in recent years as the result of heavy summer and winter rainfall. Geologists from the British Geological Survey have been measuring landslides across the UK for almost 30 years and have created a database of every landslide reported. Inside Out's Marie Ashby meets the team based in Nottinghamshire which is using technology to predict future landslides to help reduce the risk of disasters. Recent events including a road slippage in Rothbury, Northumberland and a railway landslip at Stainforth, South Yorkshire illustrate the impact of landslips on communities. The collapse of a section of cliffs in Dorset also claimed the life of Charlotte Blackman from Derbyshire when she was on holiday a year ago. It is hoped new technology will allow the British Geological Survey team to link geology and weather to produce a daily landslide forecast and prevent similar accidents. Inside Out is broadcast on BBC One East Midlands on Monday, 21 October at 19:30 GMT and nationwide on the iPlayer for seven days thereafter.

      <description>The race to save computer-generated artworks</description>

      <body>When a renaissance masterpiece needs restoring, simple paints and brushes can do the job. It's all down to human skill. But what do you do when a piece of digital art worth over a million pounds and reliant on obsolete technology and old codes breaks down? The ZKM Centre for Art and Media in Karlsruhe Germany is trying to provide an answer. It has the world's largest collection of digital art, with over 500 pieces in its collection. It's also the global centre for digital art conservation. It is a Herculean effort to keep their artworks running in their original form on computers often decades old. ZKM's staff try to find as much obsolete digital kit as possible. They trawl waste dumps and the auction site eBay in their quest for authenticity. As part of these efforts, they rent a warehouse outside the city where they store over 1,600 cathode ray TV sets, which are now out of production. These old-school TVs make up key elements of some of the art works. For example, Versailles Fountain by digital pioneer Nam June Paik uses about 40 CRT TVs. They are constantly being repaired. In an unlikely alliance, curators at ZKM foster connections with local dump managers who set aside old computers and audio visual machines in exchange for cigarettes. But keeping all of this obsolete equipment in storage is just a short-term solution. Bernhard Serexhe is the principal curator at ZKM's media museum and leader of a European Union funded project on digital art conservation. He says the faster technology develops, the shorter the potential lifespan of the art. "That is why we need a second strategy which is migrating the work, migrating the data of the work to a different platform, or even porting the programme to a different system, to a different computer system which is quite complicated and quite expensive," he says. This is precisely what happened with The Legibile City. Created in 1989 by Jeffrey Shaw, it is considered by Mr Serexhe to be one of the most important pieces of digital art in the world. When you get on the stationary bike, you can cycle through giant 3D letters in three different cities. The faster you pedal, the faster words describing the city appear on screen. The problem is it was designed on a Silicon Graphics computer which went out of production 16 years ago. The museum only has 10 left in storage. The danger is when they are gone the artwork will no longer be displayed. The solution for The Legibile City has been to port it over to a Linux-based operating system. This process took several years and was done in conjunction with the artist's wishes.  "Linux was selected as the target platform for the porting. Linux is a free Unix variant that runs on the most diverse hardware platforms -including on Apple computers - which is constantly being adapted to new hardware, and, current expectations are that due to its origins [Unix], it will have a long lifespan," Mr Serexhe explains. Digital artworks in ZKM are not switched off overnight to preserve the systems and try to prolong the life of the hardware. Not everything in the museum is "born digital", a phrase used by Mr Serexhe to describe art that is completely of the digital age. Digitising video art from magnetic tapes is another important part of the museum's work. Dorcas Muller works in the Laboratory for Antiquated Video Systems. Her office is packed from floor to ceiling with ancient tapes and video equipment. She has over 300 machines at her disposal to convert about 50 different formats into digital form. "The most important machines which are completely restored we keep in the laboratory for daily use and we have storage outside the city where we have machines up to the ceiling for future years," she says. The market for pure digital art is very different from the one for more conventional art. Materials and machines become obsolete while canvas and stone live on. "There is a certain market but normally these works go from the artists to the collector… there are only very few collectors. In Germany at the moment there is only one private collector of digital art," says Mr Serexhe in Germany. But there is no consensus on whether repairing digital art is the right thing to do. Some of the artists may have intended their works be shown as a performance, and to cease existing when the technology running it breaks down. The museum's efforts are controversial. "Either we change our ethical aspect ideas about art, and we would consider digital art as only 'performative', or we stick to the originality and authenticity of the work. "I think as an important collection we still should preserve the work in its original form and format as long as this is possible," Mr Serexhe says.

      <title>Why tech women need a makeover</title>
      <description>How to attract girls to the tech industry</description>

      <body>Anne-Marie Imafidon is in a rush to get on with life. Perhaps that is why she passed a GCSE in computer science aged 10, became the youngest graduate to attain a masters degree, aged 19, and is already planning the future of her unborn children. And if daughters come along she is clear that she doesn't want them to "feel like the odd ones out," if they decide, like her, to pursue a career in technology. As a self-confessed stubborn woman, she hopes she can succeed where others have failed - in reducing the huge gap between girls and boys studying so-called Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths. To do this, she has set up Stemettes, which she runs when she isn't in her day job at a global investment bank. She was one of just three girls in a class of 70 studying maths and computer science at university. "At the time I wasn't that bothered, I just thought it was part and parcel of studying computer science," she says. "But then last year I spoke at a conference and I heard that the numbers of women in technology was in decline and I thought, 'That isn't right.' "Technology is at the forefront of the economy and women have a vital role to play. When my daughters are born I don't want them to feel like the odd ones out." The UK has a massive skills gap. Only 17% of the UK's tech jobs are held by women. In Stem subjects generally women make up just 13% of the workforce. In engineering women fare even worse, taking up just 8% of the jobs. So where does it all go wrong? At secondary school, girls are as likely as boys to study Stem subjects, at least up to GCSE, but for A-levels and beyond, female representation drops off dramatically. And among girls who carry on and study science at university, two out of three don't go on to Stem-related careers. The reasons for the drop-off in interest are multiple, thinks Ms Imafidon. "Some schools, often girl-only schools, simply don't offer ICT [information and communications technology] at A-level and the girls wanting to do it have to go to a nearby boys school to learn it," she says. "In other schools, computer science often clashes with things like drama or music, meaning the girls can't do both. If every other girl is doing drama, you'd want to be in a class with all your friends rather than take the difficult route and do computer science." Girls are very aware that their choice of A-level subjects impacts what they study at university and which one they go to. It means that girls tend to choose "safe" subjects that they know they will get a good grade in, according to Ms Imafidon. "Choosing computer science is an unnecessarily tough choice and one you aren't going to make unless you are one of the stubborn girls like I was," she says. It isn't like that everywhere. Brazil punches above its weight, ranking highest overall in the representation of women in science and technology, according to a report from Women in Global Science and Technology. Much of that is down to programmes that support women in the workforce, good funding for education and research and support of female entrepreneurship. South Africa and India also score well. For Ms Imafidon, it is because ITC has a very different image and status in these countries. "In India if you go into technology, it is because you want to do well and get ahead in life. If you see a well-dressed women walking down the street, you don't ask is she a lawyer or a banker but is she working in IT," she says. The aim of Stemettes and other sister organisations is to replicate in the West what is happening in the developing world. To facilitate that, the group runs events around the country aimed at getting girls interested in technology. Girls are introduced to a range of women already working in Stem subjects and are invited to take part in events such as hackathons. "We get them making mobile apps, data visualisations, having fun," says Ms Imafidon. The fact that they can do all this surrounded by other girls makes them more confident. "Coding clubs are dominated by boys. We want to make our club as normal for girls as ballet," says Ms Imafidon. At the end of the month the group will host a hackathon in Oxford, and in November it is running an exhibition at the Crystal in London's docklands. Girls aged from seven to 22 will be invited to take a variety of workshops, including dance and science, 3D printing and one on nuclear substances. The goal of Stemettes and its sister organisations is to get the women in the Stem workforce up to 30% by 2020. When you consider that women began coding 200 years ago, it seems like a fairly realistic ambition. This week saw the annual Ada Lovelace day, which every year celebrates the achievements of the Victorian woman credited with writing the first piece of code for Charles Babbage's analytical engine. The fact that Mrs Lovelace was coding in an age when even few men were, shows that there is no inherent aptitude problem, thinks Ms Imafidon. "It isn't that girls can't do it, it is that they are choosing not to do it," she says. "She was doing it 200 years ago so we have no excuse." </body>

      <title>Crowdfunding the arts in South Africa</title>
      <description>South African musicians ask their listeners to turn investors</description>

      <body>Money for a Monteverdi melody, and Bach for their buck. The Cape Consort is a Cape Town-based ensemble in search of investment to help them put on a concert. As with many struggling artists, they are in need of funding. After all, "musicians need to pay rent and eat just like everybody else," says Hans Huyssen, cellist with the group. The Cape Consort has turned to crowdfunding, an online collective fundraising approach. They achieved their target amount of 15,000 rand ($1,525; £945), raising 60% of that in just six days. The funds raised allowed them to put on a series of concerts, with the last one having just taken place on Sunday in Cape Town. Instead of approaching one investor to ask for capital, crowdfunding is an online platform that allows small initiatives like Cape Consort to post proposals on a dedicated website and ask the world wide crowd for funding. Even though the concept of collective fundraising is not new, (New York-based Kickstarter is widely credited with pioneering online crowdfunding in 2009), one crowdfunding website in South Africa is using it in an unusual way, to get funding for the arts. Patrick Schofield is the founder of Thundafund, described as a "crowdfunding cafe" for African innovators and creative entrepreneurs. It provides both a crowdfunding platform together with mentorship. "I think the funding is one thing but people need the supporting environment to help them realise their idea and to make it successful, and that's what we bring together," he says. Thundafund has been up and running for over four months, and 80% of the projects that have gone on the website have gained funding. Michelle Constant is the chief executive of Business and Arts South Africa (BASA), a public-private partnership that aims to build partnerships between business and the arts. "It's simplistic to assume that the private sector and the government can do all the funding of the arts as we move forward into the future," she says. Funding arts projects will always take a backseat to issues such as reducing poverty and improving healthcare and housing - issues which are key in Africa. "So if there is an opportunity where people who in their individual capacity can give [to the arts], it's exciting," says Ms Constant. But crowdfunding for the arts is about more than just funding a specific project - it's also about tapping into a more engaged audience by using technology as a platform. Mr Schofield compares the power of crowdfunding as a vehicle for raising money to the power of social media when it comes to current affairs. "When you talk to 100 people and say, 'look, I'm not asking you for a huge amount, instead I'm going to say back me with a small amount and together we'll all make it happen' - in many ways it's the same way as news is fed through Twitter. "There's 100 people talking about the event and it's often so much more powerful than one voice and they will funnel 100 people together to a larger channel." With crowdfunding, as with any investment, you get a return. However, rather than a financial return, what you're most likely to gain is a creative product, be it a book, play, performance or CD. On the other hand, unlike with a financial product, you know exactly what you're getting for your money as those who are doing the crowdfunding have to be upfront about what they can offer. For instance, for an investment of 50 rand the Cape Consort will put your name on their website. Meanwhile, for 20,000 rand you can get four tickets to one of their performances, signed programmes, and an exclusive private concert among other things. But can online crowdfunding work in a country where so many people don't have access to the internet? Media analyst Arthur Goldstuck says it is already working, adding that while the digital divide may not be an issue, there are challenges. "Those who have the means to participate in crowdfunding wouldn't really be the 'have-nots', so in South Africa the 'haves' have relatively good internet access… so that really isn't the constraint," Mr Goldstuck says. "The constraint is more around trust of the crowdfunding model and the essence of crowdfunding is you have to hype up your product and create enthusiasm for it and that's not how investors like to be drawn into an investment opportunity." Thundafund's Patrick Schofield also believes that the crowdfunding model can be an ideological tool that can bring about change. He calls crowdfunding "funds with benefits" and says it "allows us to make the world as we would like it". If the audience supports an idea online, the idea will come to life; if there's no support, there's no execution. This allows an interactive audience to dictate what they want to see in the creative arts arena by supporting it. As Hans Huyssen, from the Cape Consort, says, "music is not something that relies on musicians only. "I mean we can rehearse and perform, but unless somebody hears what we do, the musical experience doesn't happen. "So you're involving your audience not only in concert, but also in advance, and to make them aware that they have a responsibility for the music to happen." </body>

      <body>The pursuit of artificial intelligence has long interested computer scientists, but will machines ever think for themselves, asks Lisa Jardine. In the early 1950s, "machine intelligence" was a favourite topic among those who wanted to put the war years behind them and look forward to a sparkling science-led future. From robots to electronic brains, the idea was that human beings would be able to concentrate on useful work, while programmable machines took care of useless toil. That unrealised dream still intrigues us today. In April 1951 I was taken by my parents on an outing to the Bristol laboratory of neuroscience professor William Grey Walter, to see his robotic tortoises. In a large room, half a dozen domed mechanised devices on wheels (roughly resembling tortoises) twirled and gyrated, avoided obstacles, backed away from the edges of their enclosure, and trundled apparently purposefully towards a light source beamed in their direction. These, Grey Walter maintained, were the beginnings of artificial intelligence - machines which simulated human thought and behaviour using analogue electronics to mimic brain processes. I remember the grown-ups were delighted. Back then, aged seven, I was a bit disappointed. These weren't "toys" in any sense that I understood. But the memory of the visit flooded back last weekend when I encountered a piece of archive film of the tortoises in the Codebreaker exhibition at London's Science Museum. Codebreaker charts the life and legacy of the troubled mathematician Alan Turing, best known for his crucial work on the Bombe electro-magnetical device, used to crack the code created by German Enigma machines during WWII. The exhibition includes the story of Bletchley Park, and the top secret cryptographical work Turing and others carried out there, which made such a vital contribution to the Allied victory. But it also explains a wide range of other work on early computers and machine intelligence. The Grey Walter tortoises feature as an early example of a complex machine which appears to replicate human behaviour - in other words, to think. Turing's own contributions to mathematics, and in particular to the theory behind early computers and computing went far beyond his wartime activities. Before he was recruited to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park in 1938 he had been working on the idea of a machine which could be programmed to carry out many different mathematical operations or tasks - the precursor for the electronic data processors we take for granted today. After the war Turing returned to this topic, and in 1950 published a paper entitled Computing Machinery and Intelligence, which is still cited today. In it, he speculates on what it would take for a computer to be considered to have gone beyond performing human-programmed tasks to become a "thinking machine". "I propose to consider the question," his paper begins, "Can machines think?" Arguing that they can, Turing chooses to engage directly with a computing pioneer of a century earlier who had given consideration to the question but reached the opposite conclusion - Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, or Ada Lovelace as she is generally known today. This week we celebrated Ada Lovelace day - an occasion on which we honour Lovelace herself and all other women working in what today are known as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). So let me say a little more about her before I get on to Turing's interest in her argument about machine intelligence. Lovelace was born in 1815, the only legitimate daughter of Lord Byron. Privately educated in science and mathematics, her mother was determined she should not become a poet like her father. She is acknowledged to be an important contributor to the early development of the computer and computer programming. Aged 17, Lovelace met Charles Babbage, conceiver of the Analytical Engine and regarded as the father of computing. His engine was never actually built, but is nevertheless generally recognised as the abstract precursor to a "universal machine" - one which can be programmed to perform a potentially infinite range of human tasks. Lovelace immersed herself in understanding the potential of the Analytical Engine. In the process she became possibly a clearer and more incisive exponent of it than Babbage himself. In 1842, at Babbage's request, Lovelace translated an Italian article discussing the potential of the Analytical Engine. She added a series of discussions of her own, explaining the possibilities for the engine and offering further explanation in considerable mathematical detail. These notes were approved by Babbage before publication, but Lovelace insisted on retaining total control. In late July 1842, for instance, she writes: "I am much annoyed at your having altered my note. You know I am always willing to make any required alterations myself, but that I cannot endure another person to meddle with my sentences." It is to these notes that Turing is referring a century later in his 1950 article. In one of them Lovelace says: "It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that might arise as to the powers of the Analytical Engine. The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis, but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths." We do not know how Turing came across Lovelace's notes. But he devotes a significant portion of his 1950 paper to countering what he calls "Lady Lovelace's objection" and he quotes her verbatim. Her objection, he proposes, is tantamount to saying that "computers can never take us by surprise". Indeed they can, he counters. He believes Lovelace was misled into thinking the contrary because she could have had no idea of the enormous speed and storage capacity of modern computers, making them a match for that of the human brain, and thus, like the brain, capable of processing their stored information to arrive at sometimes "surprising" conclusions. Probably the easiest way to understand what Turing had in mind is to think of the Google search engine. Initially it amazed us simply with its ability to search apparently instantaneously through every word currently on the world wide web. Now you can watch as you type, as it rapidly scans every search it has ever processed, to anticipate what you are looking for and suggest to you the question you might be just about to ask. However Turing came to read Lovelace's notes on the Analytical Engine, he considered her important enough to engage with in print. I like to think that he recognised her as a kindred spirit. She was a mathematically precocious woman, considered scandalous for her unashamed desire to engage in intellectual debate on equal terms with men. Turing was an introverted, mathematically gifted boy whose open homosexuality made his life extremely difficult, and who committed suicide in his early 40s. For both, understanding the intricate mechanisms of the mind was a goal to be pursued tirelessly and passionately, while the trials of the body were as far as possible set aside and ignored. Their encounter does help us to understand the magnitude of Lovelace's achievement. When Turing argued that machines would eventually be able to think, he had in front of him at Manchester University a truly programmable machine, the precursor to the Atlas computer - Britain's first "super-computer". Lovelace by contrast had only the idea of a computer on which to base her equally clear conviction that machines would only ever be able to do what we asked them to. Sixty years after Turing's death, when our mobile phone has 1000 times the speed and memory capacity of the Atlas computer, she has not yet been proved wrong and personally, I'm with Lovelace. But let me end with Turing. In August 1951 he and four friends visited the Festival of Britain in London - that "tonic to the nation" devised by the Labour government to foster British pride and optimism for the future. In the festival's science exhibit in South Kensington they spent some time watching Grey Walter's tortoises. They were not particularly impressed - the tortoises seemed to spend most of their time going round and round in circles - although they did like the way the tortoises responded to their own reflections in a mirror. But this wasn't much fun. They quickly abandoned South Kensington, and went instead to the festival funfair in Battersea where they thoroughly enjoyed themselves. It was one of the few happy occasions in the last years of Turing's life of which we have a record. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <description>Rwanda targets knowledge economy with tech revolution</description>

      <body>Olive Uwineza is 12 years old and dreams of becoming president one day. She sits in a class of about 30 pupils, at a high-tech primary school in Kigali, Rwanda. Each student has a green, white and orange laptop that uses cartoon animations to make lessons more fun. A lover of maths and science, Olive says tackling these subjects without computers "can make my lessons difficult". Five years ago, an initiative called One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) was introduced to the school, led by the government and NGOs. It has seen 200,000 laptops distributed in more than 400 schools across this tiny east African nation. Facilities at Olive's school have been upgraded and modernised, with access to wi-fi, and software tailored for the curriculum. The OLPC programme is one of the pillars of Rwanda's Vision 2020, which aims to turn the country into a knowledge-based economy similar to that of Singapore in South East Asia. In the wood-panelled halls of his official office, we meet President Paul Kagame, who has personally been a driver of this vision. He says information technology will help to turn Rwanda into a regional tech hub that will help Rwandans "find jobs, feed their children and regain their dignity". The tragedy of the 1994 genocide is a strong motivation for President Kagame. In his view, better access to information might have helped victims and perpetrators make different political choices. For him, the IT revolution is not only about modernising the Rwandan economy - at the core, it's about healing the nation. Mr Kagame has presided over an era of robust growth in Rwanda. Last year, the economy grew by more than 7%. Government reforms have encouraged foreign investment and the World Bank has ranked Rwanda the third best country in sub-Saharan Africa in its "Doing Business" index. But all of this could be undermined by the recent diplomatic tensions with donors. Rwanda has been accused of helping train child soldiers for rebels in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, though it has strongly rejected the allegations. In October, the US imposed sanctions on Rwanda, which may have an impact on the government's ability to pursue future economic programmes that support Vision 2020. Undeterred, government agencies continue with their work. Clare Akamanzi is the chief executive of the Rwanda Development Board, tasked with turning Vision 2020 into tangible social programmes. She says Rwanda aspires to "evolve from being an agriculture-based economy to a knowledge-based economy, mainly on high value services". In 2013 a deal was concluded with Korea Telecom to provide 4G technology across the country. At $140m (£87m) this is one of the biggest foreign direct investment deals in Rwanda. The state has laid 3,000km of fibre-optic cables over the last four years and hopes that 4G will help provide last-mile access to all communities outside of the capital, where internet connectivity is low. Clare Akamanzi says they are taking additional steps to ensure this happens. "We've built tele-centres, we've built service points, there's a communal infrastructure where we've put computers," she says. "We've also used ICT buses where we take mobile buses all over the country so people can just come and learn how to use a computer." But new technology isn't working for everyone. At a grain market on the outskirts of Kigali, traders are buying sorghum from local farmers. A mobile phone application called e-Soko was given to farmers in 2007. The app is designed to save farmers time and help them find the best deal, by sending automated text messages with the latest market prices. The farmers here, though, say they still prefer the more traditional method of face-to-face bartering. "When I call with my phone there's that possibility of an interaction," farmer Jean Baptiste Nzabamwita says. "We can bargain and say come, we can raise the price up to this one. But [with] the e-Soko... the prices are not reliable." This is just one small example of how society can sometimes resist the changes brought about by IT. Rwanda is still a largely traditional and rural country, therefore attempts to modernise the economy will have to go apace with the needs of the population at large. So does President Kagame's IT agenda come at the expense of more practical realities like healthcare, housing and rural development? His answer is simple: "The proof of the pudding is in the eating…. and we've been rewarded by progress." </body>

      <title>Silk Road: Will cybercrime evolve?</title>
      <description>Is society safer after the illegal marketplace's demise?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24526677</url>

      <body>Silk Road, the infamous online marketplace for drugs and other illegal goods, was closed down by the FBI earlier this month. Since then its alleged founder, Ross Ulbricht - who denies being the site's operator known as Dread Pirate Roberts - has been taken into custody, and police forces around the world have been making arrests. It is a blow to the sale and distribution of harmful substances, including cocaine and heroin, as well as disrupting other criminal activities arranged online, such as the sale of weapons and hitmen for hire. But for how long will society have been made safer? Does it mean the end for illegal marketplaces hidden in the so-called "deep web", which depend on the anonymity provided by the Tor network and the Bitcoin digital currency to attract buyers and sellers? Or is it little more than a minor inconvenience? One man with first-hand experience of FBI takedowns is Emmanuel Gadaix. He was one of the directors of Megaupload, the popular file-sharing website founded by Kim Dotcom that was closed down by the US Department of Justice in January 2012. "This changes nothing in the same way that the closure of Megaupload changed nothing," he says. "All that happens if you bust him [Dread Pirate Roberts] is that two new people come along. "The closure of Silk Road is no more the end of online narcotics sales as the arrest of Al Capone was the end of organised crime." Another man with similar experience is a twenty-something expat Irishman who calls himself H2.0. He is the ex-spokesman for a deep web drugs marketplace called Atlantis, which was closed down by its operators shortly before the Silk Road takedown for "security reasons". Criminals may be more than willing to prey on others, but when it comes to their own dealings they want to feel safe, and H2.0 says Silk Road had managed to build a strong brand in the underworld. "It was a pillar of trust in an otherwise Wild West of dodgy scamsites," he says. But he is sure an alternative to Silk Road will emerge. "We could be in for a period of sites popping up for a few months and closing [just] as fast. Silk Road will be replaced fast but the trust will take longer." Other marketplaces for illegal goods still exist in the deep web - Sheep and Black Market Reloaded (BMR) are two of the better-known ones - and it appears that former Silk Road sellers are already setting up shop in them. "I do know one vendor who was previously one of the top-selling vendors on Atlantis," H2.0 adds. "He moved to Silk Road as soon as Atlantis closed, and two weeks after Silk Road closed he is already set up on Sheep and BMR. "Vendors even seem confident enough to carry forward the same usernames and reputations from Silk Road, which shows they don't seem too worried about being tracked." But security expert Brian Krebs thinks the takedown is significant. "It once again dispels the myth of anonymity on the web, or in this case on the deep web," he suggests. "That's a big deal because clearly many buyers and sellers in this community were under the impression that their actions somehow could not be traced online." In the future, illegal deep web marketplaces are likely to attempt to reassure drug dealers and their customers that their communications with each other are secure by making it easy to encrypt conversations. It turns out that a software package called BitWasp that aims to provide this is already under development, and as an open source project will be available free to anyone who wants it. The man behind BitWasp is known in internet circles as afk11. He currently spends between 30 and 50 hours a week developing it, he tells the BBC. He describes himself as unemployed, 21 years old and from Ireland. Afk11 claims his motivation is to help promote the virtual currency Bitcoin, suggesting it could become a popular way to pay for concert tickets and other events. "Just because people want to remain private doesn't mean things are suspicious," he says. But does he believe that drugs marketplace operators will also use his software? "The short answer would be yes, they probably will," afk11 says. "We're not specifically gearing our project towards the 'dark web' although it will certainly have features which are popular on it, such as PGP encryption. "But it's more important to us that Bitcoin becomes adopted by the masses." The next generation of illegal marketplace operators will be much harder for the FBI or other law enforcement agencies to catch, according to a Bangkok-based security expert and broker of security exploits known as the Grugq. "You can be famous, or a criminal, but you can't be a famous criminal," he says. "[Dread Pirate Roberts] was advertising everywhere and attracting attention - which is never a good thing." He says that the new marketplaces will last longer because the operators won't make the same mistakes. "Each bust works as evolutionary pressure, selecting out the insecure sites and training the other ones what to do better, so there will be better and better services (for buyers and sellers) with each iteration of these marketplaces after each bust," he says. Mr Krebs concurs: "Denizens of these communities will learn from their mistakes... with the result that the up-and-coming communities probably will be more difficult to penetrate and take down." But the Grugq believes that despite the protection and anonymity that Tor, Bitcoin and encryption can provide, many marketplaces and their users will get caught thanks to old-fashioned police techniques. "What you will see with these sites is that as they become higher-profile, undercover agents will infiltrate them as vendors or customers," he says. "They may even work their way into the inner circle and become administrators working for the site." One thing the Silk Road takedown has done is show that operators of illegal marketplaces can and do get caught. And ultimately it's the fear of that happening that may put many people off embarking on a criminal career in the deep web. "I think a legit career move is best for me," H2.0 concludes. "Whoever wants to be the next Dread Pirate Roberts better be able to handle the stress. I didn't like it." </body>

      <body>Nike says its new activity-tracking Fuelband SE will motivate people to exercise even more. But can a wristband really lead to better health? Back in 2009, Nike vice-president of digital sport Stefan Olander and his team had an idea: what if a person could track how much they've moved in a day, just by glancing at their wrist? And so, the Nike Fuelband was born. Released in 2012, in a simple, sleek, black plastic design that flashed from red to green once a person's daily fitness goal had been met, the first Fuelband sold out in hours. The pitch was this: by wearing a Fuelband and monitoring fitness data via an app or on the web, anyone - from a professional athlete to Mr Olander himself - could work out a better, more effective, path to health. "In today's society, we are overwhelmed with complexity," says Mr Olander. With the Fuelband, he says, Nike really tries "to filter out what doesn't matter and just give you what you need in order to stay motivated." So what's different this time around? Nike says that in addition to making physical improvements to the latest Fuelband - better waterproofing, stainless steel screws - it has also analysed the data from the first wave of Fuelband adopters to see ways in which the band and its supporting iOS app and website could be improved. They found that 98% of their 20 million users exercised - but they didn't necessarily consistently move the recommended five minutes every hour. Now, the wristband buzzes to alert its wearer if he or she hasn't got up in a while. But Nike is not the only company experimenting with wearable technology - particularly as estimates about the potential growth in the industry range from $10bn to $50bn (£6bn to £31bn) in the next five years. Competitor Fitbit recently released a new model, and Jawbone, iHealth, Garmin, Withings and Adidas are among other firms to offer dedicated fitness-measuring gadgets. Samsung and Sony recently released a smartwatch that can monitor a user's steps, and even Apple - whose boss, Tim Cook, sits on Nike's board of directors - has expressed an interest in a device. But beyond these gadgets, Nike's main competition might not be a rival band, but the smartphone. "Smartphones are going to start doing more of the tracking, and more people have them already and don't have to buy separate devices," says Sara Watson, a fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Already, there is a spate of apps - from MyMee to MapMyRun - capitalising on these built-in features. Beyond the competition, there is also the basic question: can wearing a wristband really make you healthier? "The notion of tracking itself has been around a long time - this is not something new," says Michael Kim, a former Microsoft Xbox executive who is now the head of Kairos Labs. "The problem is tracking does not create new behaviour change - it tracks what you already do as a behaviour," says Mr Kim, whose firm works to help people cement their habits. But some doctors say the bands can help those who are already interested in exercise better tailor their workouts. "We have done a number of athletic performance tracking projects with people," says Dr Paul Abramson, a physician in San Francisco who uses tracking technologies in his practice. "Things like the Fuelband or more complex versions of them can be very useful for people who want to exercise more." Companies are also showing an interest in tracking sensors. In 2008 Bank of America equipped dozens of its call centre staff with special badges to study the way they interacted with each other as part of efforts to boost productivity. One technology consultant suggested several firms were now interested in using fitness equipment as a way of encouraging their staff to bond. "At a symposium event last week I was talking to a couple of companies that were trying to improve employee engagement, and there's some thinking that not only are healthier employees more productive but that their sharing of information about how much they are walking, how much they are riding etc is becoming the new 'water cooler' moment," says Mike Gotta from Gartner. However, he cautions that managers should resist the temptation to see the gadgets as the human equivalent of the black boxes used by some car insurance companies to track driver behaviour. "A few months back one firm made the news for saying: 'If you don't meet certain criteria we're going to charge you more per month for your healthcare.' That kind of behaviour could create a backlash," Mr Gotta warns. "But if firms give these analytics to the employees for their own self-improvement and are relatively hands-off, then the workers will share the information themselves and that could create better relationships across teams." Experts also note that gadgets like the Fuelband still have plenty of room for improvement. At present the measurements it captures are not always precise. Rivals are attempting to address this by offering a wider range of sensors. Withings, for example, has built a heart-rate monitor into its Pulse tracker; Polar's Loop carries out a similar trick by connecting its wristband to a separate accessory; Fitbit includes an altimeter in its new Force wristband to count the number of stairs climbed; while Motorola's Motoactv can be linked up with bicycle-fitted sensors that measure how fast the equipment is being pedalled and its speed of travel. Sensors that measure skin temperature, perspiration and the electrical activity produced by muscles offer further opportunities. "The fitness space has spawned a whole host of explorations of tracking devices in other areas," says Steve Dean, a partner at Prehype and a founder of the Quantified Self group in New York, which meets to discuss personal data tracking projects and technologies. "It's almost like there's an endless amount of things that we can instrument on our body." </body>

      <title>Supercell: Europe’s supercharged games success</title>
      <description>Clash of Clans games developer Supercell's $1.5bn deal</description>

      <body>It is a Finnish company started in 2010, whose first products only emerged in 2011. You've probably never heard of Supercell, but on Tuesday it was valued at $3bn, making it the fastest growing technology firm to come out of Europe in, well, just about ever. Supercell is a games business with just two titles, Clash of Clans and Hay Day, which until last week could only be played on Apple's iPhone and iPad. But they have grabbed a huge share of the mobile gaming market, leading the world in terms of revenue, ahead of giants like EA which has 829 titles to Supercell's two. On Tuesday Japan's Softbank paid $1.5bn to acquire a 51% stake in Supercell. The telecoms firm is doing the deal in conjunction with its own gaming subsidiary GungHo, another major player in the new world of mobile games. This might look like another of those dotcom deals, where a wealthy corporate giant pays over the odds for a business with big user numbers but no concrete business plan. But Supercell is making money hand over fist - revenues grew from $100m in 2012 to $179m in the first quarter of this year and are on course to hit $1bn for the whole year. Key to its success has been its ability to crack the Asian market, something many other games developers have tried and failed to do. It has already been working with GungHo and has now brought its games to Android, essential for any firm competing in China. It all looks like a great success for Finland, also home of the Angry Birds firm Rovio, and for the wider European technology scene. Supercell was backed by London-based venture capital firms including Index Ventures and Atomico. They bought in at a valuation of $770m back in February, so have made their investment back four times over in the space of six months - though existing investors will retain half of their stakes in the business. That means more money will now be available to invest in other start-ups, and even if Supercell is now controlled from Japan, Tuesday's news will be a great boost for the image of the European games industry. The UK firm behind the phenomenally successful Candy Crush Saga, King.com, is currently working on its stock market debut, while the Moshi Monsters business Mind Candy is also rumoured to be thinking of an IPO. Both may end up on New York's Nasdaq over the next year. What is slightly disappointing is that these companies seem to be looking outside Europe - to Asia or the US - when they are seeking the funding they need to progress to the next stage of their development. But European games developers are showing that they have mastered what consumers want in the mobile world and using their skills to build big businesses in a hurry. </body>

      <title>Major calls for energy windfall tax</title>
      <description>Former prime minister Sir John Major calls for a windfall tax on the profits of the UK's top energy firms.</description>

      <body>Former prime minister Sir John Major has called for an emergency tax on the profits of the UK's top energy firms. The ex-Conservative leader said recent price rises of more than 10% were "unacceptable" and action was needed. The government could claw back the cost of extra winter fuel payments through a one-off tax, he suggested. Downing Street said there was no such plan but called Sir John's comments "interesting". Energy firms said they were helping customers keep bills down. Ministers have rejected a call by Labour leader Ed Miliband for a price freeze, describing it as a "con" and urging hard-pressed consumers to switch suppliers instead. Three of the "big six" energy firms - Npower, SSE, and British Gas - have announced plans to raise gas and electricity bills by between 8% and 10%. Analysts expect the others - Scottish Power, E.On and EDF - to follow suit with similar price increases. Speaking at a lunch for political journalists, Sir John - prime minister between 1990 and 1997 - said price rises of this kind were not justified and it would be "entirely reasonable" for the government to impose a one-off levy to recover the cost of cold weather payments this winter. Cold weather payments are triggered when the temperature falls below a certain level for a prolonged period. Those on income support and other work-related benefits are eligible for a £25 payment if temperatures drop to zero degrees Celsius or below for seven consecutive days. Fuel poverty campaigners have said the price rises will leave some people with the choice of having to "heat or eat" this winter but energy firms say they are needed to cover the cost of rising wholesale prices and environmental obligations. Asked about Labour's plan for price freeze if it is elected in 2015, Sir John said "Ed Miliband's heart was in the right place but his head has gone walkabout", adding that the plan was unworkable. "But he did touch on an issue that's very important. The private sector is something the Conservative party support but when the private sector goes wrong or behaves badly I think it is entirely right to make changes and put it right. "At the moment I do not see how it can be in any way acceptable that with energy prices rising broadly 4% in terms of costs that the price to the consumer should rise by the 9-10% that we are hearing." He later told the BBC that the was a "crisis" in the energy market and there was a "very real chance" that the government would have to increase the amount of assistance it gave to people in the event of cold snap. Should this happen, he said a "one-off retrospective" tax should be considered "given the scale of their (energy firms') profits and the unjustified nature of the price increases they have just proposed". The BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said the prime minister and his chancellor were instinctively opposed to short-term fixes and believed only action on competition and supply would reduce bills. But he said intervention from such a senior figure would increase pressure on them to do something. In response to the ex-PM's comments, Ed Miliband tweeted: "Sir John Major makes Labour's argument: David Cameron stands up for the energy companies not hard-pressed families." Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint said the former PM was "joining a chorus of voices who are concerned about the way the public has been left out of pocket". But she said Labour opposed a windfall tax, as it would be complicated and it was unclear how it would benefit consumers, while a price freeze was a "simple measure" to give consumers immediate respite. The government has said the price rises are "disappointing" but has insisted a price freeze could actually lead to higher prices in the long-term and what is needed is more competition. "There are a number of initiatives that the government has to support vulnerable people, such as the cold weather payments," a No 10 spokesman said. "We have a range of ways in which support is given and those are the right ones." Conservative business minister Michael Fallon said: "It's an interesting idea but we think a faster way to bear down on prices is more competition, simpler tariffs and making it much easier for people to switch to a cheaper supplier." The Energy UK trade association said: "No one should be afraid to put the heating on this winter. If customers are worried they should get in touch with their energy supplier and they should be able to help. "The energy industry is doing an increasing amount to help vulnerable customers and we will be looking at what more can be done to help people worried about their bills." The bosses of the leading energy firms have been called to appear before MPs next week to explain the price rises. Earlier on Tuesday, Scottish Power was told to pay £8.5m to many of its customers after being found to have misled them about the benefits of switching to alternative suppliers and other breaches of its licence obligations. More than 140,000 customers on the warm homes discount schemes, designed to support those at risk of fuel poverty, will receive about £50 in compensation each. </body>

      <title>'Go home' vans not good idea - May</title>
      <description>Vans telling illegal immigrants to "go home" or face arrest will not be rolled out across the UK, Home Secretary Theresa May says.</description>

      <body>Theresa May has said vans telling illegal immigrants to "go home" or face arrest will not be rolled out across the UK. A trial of the controversial vans in London is still being evaluated. But the home secretary told MPs she accepted they had "not been a good idea" and were too much of a "blunt instrument". Labour said Mrs May must take responsibility for the "complete failure" of the policy. Explaining her decision to ditch the campaign in the Commons, the home secretary said: "What I've done is looked at the interim evaluation in relation to the plans - and there were some returns achieved as a result of that. "Politicians should be willing to step up to the plate and say when they think something actually hasn't been as good an idea, and I think they were too blunt an instrument." But she defended government attempts to tighten up immigration enforcement when people overstay their visas, which she said had resulted in "something around 4,000 people leaving the UK". The government pilot, which saw vans driving around parts of London for a week in July, drew criticism from across the political spectrum. Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable described the campaign as "stupid" while UKIP said the scheme was "disturbing" and reminiscent of a fascist dictatorship. The vans were also criticised by the Advertising Standards Authority, which said the arrest statistics on them were misleading, although the watchdog cleared the campaign of being offensive and irresponsible. During the campaign, the vans drove around the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow - all ethnically diverse areas where it is thought a lot of illegal immigrants live and work. The poster displayed a picture of handcuffs and read: "In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest." Home Office ministers insisted the pilot had worked - and they were considering extending it elsewhere. Speaking earlier this month, Police Minister Damian Green said the "hard-hitting" campaign had "let people know that 'the traditional view that if you have been here illegally nothing would happen to you' is not the case". The Lib Dems say they were not consulted about the idea and would have opposed it had they known, and party president Tim Farron has suggested they should take credit for not allowing it to go any further. "This is a failed project and the Home Office should hold their hands up and admit it was wrong both practically and morally," he said. But Labour said it "beggared belief" that the Lib Dems were trying to "claim victory for ending a policy that they signed off in the first place". Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said her Conservative counterpart must take responsibility for the "complete failure" of the idea. "You agreed to that slogan," she said during heated exchanges in the Commons. "And you agreed to send it round communities whose parents heard it from the National Front in the 1970s and whose British citizens work in our public services, build our businesses and fight in our armed forces today. "You signed this policy off, you defended it, all for the sake of one person returning. You should be better than that. I hope you are ashamed of what you did. "You should confirm that you will never pursue such divisive gimmicks again. It is beneath you and it ought to be beneath this government." Conservative MP Henry Smith told the BBC's Daily Politics it had been an idea "worth looking at" but it had been practically flawed and made "people less willing to report if they were in the country illegally rather than more willing". A request by the BBC to see the Home Office's initial evaluation of the pilot has been turned down. The BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani requested information about the response to the ad campaign, under Freedom of Information laws. But he was told the details were intended for "future publication" and therefore were exempt from disclosure rules. It is not clear when the study will be published. </body>

      <title>Stuart Hall stripped of OBE by Queen</title>
      <description>Former BBC broadcaster Stuart Hall is stripped of his OBE by the Queen after he was jailed for a series of sexual assaults on young girls.</description>

      <body>Former BBC broadcaster Stuart Hall has been stripped of his OBE by the Queen after he was jailed for a series of sexual assaults on young girls. The Queen has directed the honour should be "cancelled and annulled" and his name be "erased" from the register. In June, Hall, 83, admitted 14 counts against girls aged from nine to 17 between 1967 and 1985. His 15-month sentence was doubled by the Court of Appeal in July. Hall was made an OBE in December 2011. An independent forfeiture committee recommended he should lose his honour for bringing the system into disrepute. The Honours Forfeiture Committee's recommendation was sent to the Queen by the Prime Minister. Her final decision was published in the London Gazette, the official Crown newspaper. Hall was initially arrested in December 2012 and made a statement labelling the claims "pernicious, callous, cruel and above all spurious". Preston Crown Court heard the former It's a Knockout host was an "opportunistic predator" who used his fame to befriend girls. About 150 complaints were made concerning the length of Hall's original prison term. At the Court of Appeal, Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge said the original sentence was "unduly lenient" given the impact on Hall's victims. Lord Judge said Hall had "got away with it" for decades and had "lived a lie for more than half of his life". Hall had been a familiar face and voice in British broadcasting for half a century, and was appointed OBE in the 2012 New Year Honours. He is expected to serve half of his 30-month sentence, meaning he will be released in September 2014, the BBC understands. Lancashire Police has been investigating further historical allegations against Hall which they received after he was jailed. </body>

      <title>'Plebgate has hit trust' in police</title>
      <description>One in four people say they are "less likely" to trust police after accusations of misconduct by officers in the "Plebgate" row, a poll for the BBC finds.</description>

      <body>One in four people say they are "less likely" to trust police in the wake of "Plebgate", a poll for the BBC found. Despite accusations officers lied to undermine then cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell, the ComRes survey of 1,000 people found 82% are still likely to believe what the police say. Mr Mitchell has denied calling police "plebs" outside Downing Street. Officers from the police union in his constituency have apologised for "poor judgement" over the affair. The apology came after a transcript emerged of a meeting they had attended with Mr Mitchell, then government chief whip. The Independent Police Complaints Commission has said the officers misrepresented him at a press conference after the meeting, which the minister had called to defuse the row with police. The BBC's poll asked how the affair had affected people's "opinion" of the police. While 67% said it had made "no difference", 26% responded that it had made them "slightly less" or "much less" likely to trust the police. Only 5% said the affair had increased their trust in the police. The poll suggests public trust overall remains high, with 82% saying they were "very likely" or "fairly likely" to believe officers speaking either on television or on the streets while on duty. But it found that 40% agreed with the statement: "Generally, the police seem to try to cover up wrongdoing by those in its ranks." And in Mr Mitchell's West Midlands region as well as in Scotland and among skilled manual workers, overall trust was fractionally lower, with one in five saying they were unlikely to believe what officers say. The three officers accused by the IPCC of having tried to discredit Mr Mitchell are due to appear before MPs on the influential Home Affairs Select Committee on Wednesday. The inspector who investigated the comments made by the officers after the meeting has also been called to appear. But the Police and Crime Commissioner for one of the forces concerned accused friends of the ex-minister of "baying for blood" over the affair. Warwickshire PCC Ron Ball said Mr Mitchell and his supporters should have accepted the Police Federation's apology. Conservative backbencher David Davis has said the officers should "face the consequences" of what he described as their "deliberate misconduct". </body>

      <title>Jones backs halting winter surgery</title>
      <description>First Minister Carwyn Jones backs plans to suspend some non-urgent surgery in four hospitals in mid and west Wales over the winter.</description>

      <body>First Minister Carwyn Jones has backed a health board's plan to postpone some non-urgent surgery at mid and west Wales hospitals this winter. Hywel Dda Health Board said on Monday that certain orthopaedic schedules would be cancelled for a period of time while it dealt with increased pressure. The hospitals affected are in Carmarthen, Haverfordwest, Llanelli and Aberystwyth. Conservatives said the move would have a "massive impact" on patients. The health board said it would review its plans "towards the end of the winter surge". QandA: Hywel Dda Health Board on halting operations The health service union Unison has criticised the move and said that for patients it would result in longer delays and cause "further distress and possibly further complications to their condition". Mr Jones faced close questioning from each of the three other party leaders at First Minister's Question Time on Tuesday at the Senedd. Mr Jones told Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood: "Hywel Dda is doing exactly what her party has called for - that is planning for winter pressures. "It is wholly wrong to say the health board is cancelling all non-urgent elective orthopaedic surgery. "Those who've been scheduled to have orthopaedic surgery will receive it, all cancer, urgent trauma and day surgery work will continue." But in response Ms Wood said Hywel Dda had a waiting time of 15 months for orthopaedic surgery and she urged the first minister "take responsibility" for NHS delays. "Are you aware of the level of outrage amongst clinicians at Hywel Dda, who've been told that they're having a third of their work taken away from them this winter?" she said. Mr Jones told Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams he was informed about the health board's plans the day before it announced them. Ms Williams replied: "It seems that you're not very clear about the LHBs plans for this winter, your government isn't very clear about the LHBs plans for this winter and the public and the clinicians, it seems, are not very clear either." Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said it showed "the government is detached from the reality of what many patients and clinicians are experiencing within the Welsh NHS". Mr Davies questioned whether Welsh ministers were "in the loop" as operations that would have otherwise been scheduled were now being cancelled, decisions that would have a "massive impact on the patient experience and also the ability of that health board to retain its key clinicians". He accused the first minister of being "flippant" in the face of such serious proposals and warned of the dangers of a "crisis situation" developing over the next five months. Mr Jones said Mr Davies was "either setting out to be disingenuous" or wasn't listening to his replies and insisted that what the Conservative leader was suggesting would actually cause a crisis situation. Meanwhile other health boards in Wales have outlined their strategies for coping with winter pressures to BBC Wales. Three boards - Cardiff and Vale, Abertawe Bro Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan - said they would open extra beds, with Aneurin Bevan also promising extra staff. The Cwm Taf and Betsi Cadwaladr boards said they would work with the ambulance service and local councils to minimise the impact on hospitals. Betsi Cadwaladr officials added that the three main hospitals serving north Wales would concentrate on emergencies while non-urgent surgery would be handled by other units. </body>

      <title>Why Beckham had to go - Ferguson</title>
      <description>Sir Alex Ferguson, in his latest autobiography, says David Beckham had to leave Manchester United as he thought he was "bigger than the manager".</description>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70635000/jpg/_70635829_alex-ferguson-and-david-beckham_221013_e_ap_getty-non-split_464-x-261.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Sir Alex Ferguson says David Beckham had to leave Manchester United because the former England captain thought he was "bigger than the manager". In his latest autobiography, Ferguson said he fell out with Beckham after criticising his performance during an FA Cup defeat by Arsenal in 2003. "The minute a Manchester United player thought he was bigger than the manager, he had to go," he wrote. "David thought he was bigger than Alex Ferguson. "That was the death knell for him." Ferguson also said he had concerns about Beckham's celebrity lifestyle, following the player's marriage to Victoria Adams, a member of the pop group the Spice Girls. "David was the only player I managed who chose to be famous, who made it his mission to be known outside the game," wrote Ferguson. "I felt uncomfortable with the celebrity aspect of his life." In a press conference on Tuesday to launch his book, Ferguson added: "He fell in love with Victoria - that changed everything." But he also praised Beckham for his contribution to United's success and called him an "icon to every kid in the world". Beckham, who won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups and one Champions League crown during his United career, was eventually sold to Real Madrid for £25m in the summer of 2003, before moving to the United States to play for LA Galaxy. As for Ferguson, he brought his career as United boss to a close in May, ending one of the most successful managerial reigns in British history. During his 26 years in charge at Old Trafford, he won 38 trophies and managed some of the biggest names in football, like Beckham, Eric Cantona, Cristiano Ronaldo, Peter Schmeichel, Bryan Robson, Roy Keane, Jaap Stam and Ruud Van Nistelrooy. Ferguson also writes in 'Alex Ferguson: My Autobiography' that: Ferguson also describes in detail his version of the dressing-room bust-up with Beckham that followed the FA Cup loss to Arsenal. "He was around 12 feet from me," wrote Ferguson. "David swore. I moved towards him and, as I approached, I kicked a boot. It hit him right above the eye. "Of course, he rose to have a go at me and the players stopped him. 'Sit down,' I said. 'You've let your team down. You can argue as much as you like.' "I called him in the next day to go through the video and he still would not accept his mistake. "The next day the story was in the press. It was in those days that I told the board David had to go." After helping Real Madrid win La Liga, Beckham moved to the United States in 2007, guiding LA Galaxy to victory in the MLS Cup. "I imagine he also had his eyes on Hollywood and the impact it would have on the next phase of his career," Ferguson added. "There was no footballing reason to go to America." Keane was another player who Ferguson decided was no longer wanted at Old Trafford. The Scot describes how his relationship deteriorated with the Republic of Ireland midfielder, to the point that he became a negative influence. "With Roy, there were episodes of great friction and drama as he tried to impose his will on the team," wrote Ferguson. "On one occasion, as I came in to the dressing room, Roy and Ruud van Nistelrooy were at it, hammer and tongs. They had to be pulled apart by the players." Keane left United in November 2005, just a few weeks after angering Ferguson for criticising team-mates in an interview for MUTV. Ferguson also allowed Ronaldo to leave Old Trafford in 2009, but only after Real Madrid had agreed to pay £80m for the winger. "Cristiano was the most gifted player I managed," wrote Ferguson. "He surpassed all the other great ones I coached at United - and I had many." Ronaldo had wanted to move to Real Madrid the previous summer, but Ferguson blocked a potential transfer because he was unhappy with the way Real president Ramon Calderon had behaved. Ferguson told Ronaldo he would rather "shoot" him than sell him to Real, claiming he would lose his "honour" if he agreed to a sale. However, the Scot promised to let the player leave the following year, which he did when Madrid made a world record bid. Ferguson, whose trophy haul at United includes 13 league titles, two Champions League crowns, five FA Cups and four League Cups, decided to quit as manager in May and was replaced by David Moyes. Under Moyes, who left Everton to take the Old Trafford job, the defending Premier League champions have made their worst league start in 24 years and lie eighth in the table, eight points adrift of leaders Arsenal. </body>

      <description>An exam body reveals that most A-level grade predictions from schools are incorrect when final results are published</description>

      <body>Most A-level grade predictions made by teachers are incorrect when the final results are published, according to data revealed by an exam body. Predicted grades are an important part of the university application process. Only 48% of predicted grades were correct for pupils taking the OCR exam board's A-levels in summer 2012, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Almost one in 10 of the wrong forecasts, more than 15,000 entries, were incorrect by more than one grade. For this one exam board, there were more than 186,000 incorrect forecasts for that summer's A-levels. These teacher forecasts were gathered by the OCR board in May, a few weeks ahead of the exam season. As such they should have been more accurate than the January predictions used in the university admissions system. The findings could re-ignite questions about the fairness of a prediction-based university application system, before pupils know their results. Although, the exam body says, it means more than 90% of forecasts were correct within a margin of one grade. The A-level statistics published by Cambridge Assessment, OCR's parent body, show that teachers were much more likely to be over-optimistic about results - with 39% over-predicting, compared with 13% whose predictions turned out to be lower than the actual grades. Independent school teachers were the most accurate in predicting the right grade, followed by grammar schools, academies, sixth form colleges and comprehensives. The lowest level of accuracy was for teachers in further education. Predictions from further education colleges, as the least accurate at both ends of the scale, were both the most likely to be over-optimistic and the most likely to be wrongly pessimistic. Independent and grammar schools were the toughest in terms of predictions, with the lowest levels of over-optimism. Teachers were much stronger at predicting the highest grades, A* and A, with more than 60% accuracy. For C-grades, only 47% had been correctly predicted. But the figures also show that over a range of subjects, when a pupil is forecast three A-grades or better, only 35% of these predictions prove to be correct. Oxford University said that there were other factors considered in applications, as well as predicted grades. "We look carefully at a range of factors when considering a student's application, including GCSE scores, aptitude test results, interview performance, teacher reference and Ucas statement, so that we are not reliant on predicted grades to select the very best students," said admissions spokesman, Matt Pickles. </body>

      <body>A would-be bridegroom who made a hoax bomb threat to a wedding venue after realising he had failed to confirm his booking has been jailed. Neil McArdle, 36, of Medbourne Crescent, Liverpool, realised his error the day before he was due to marry at St George's Hall in the city in April. Rather than tell fiancee Amy Williams, he made a bomb-threat call from a phone box, Liverpool Crown Court heard. He was given a 12-month jail sentence after admitting making the hoax call. McArdle could not face telling Miss Williams, the "love of his life", that the big day "that was all she talked about" was not going to happen, the court heard. So as she got dressed on the morning of the wedding he slipped out of the house, went to a phone box and, disguising his voice, told the receptionist at Liverpool Register Office, which is part of St George's Hall: "This is not a hoax call. "There's a bomb in St George's Hall and it will go off in 45 minutes." The call, 11 days after the Boston Marathon bombing, provoked "terror" and the building was immediately evacuated and emergency services called. Miss Williams was left standing outside in her wedding dress with her mother and the rest of the wedding party. But his would-be in-laws were already suspicious, the court heard, and a row broke out with Miss Williams's sister telling a "flustered" McArdle: "You probably done the bomb scare yourself." Police quickly traced the call and McArdle was arrested the same day, admitting to his "embarrassment and shame" that he panicked and staged the bomb scare after bungling the wedding booking forms. He later pleaded guilty to communicating false information about a bomb hoax. Miss Williams has stood by the defendant, the court heard, and they are still together. Barrister Charles Lander, mitigating, said: "If it wasn't so serious the facts of this case have all the markings of a comedy." However, he said McArdle realised this was "no laughing matter". Judge Norman Wright said it was an "extremely serious" case, with custody the only appropriate sentence. </body>

      <body>Police failings in part led to the killing of a mother and son by her ex-partner, an inquest jury has ruled. Andrew Cairns, 44, stabbed Rachael Slack, 38, and their 23-month-old son Auden on 2 June 2010 at her home in Holbrook, Derbyshire. The jury found police failure to impress on Ms Slack the danger she and Auden faced "more than minimally contributed" to their deaths. Ms Slack and Auden were unlawfully killed and Cairns took his own life. Coroner Dr Robert Hunter said he would be writing to the Home Secretary to raise issues over the powers police have to detain suspects in cases concerning violent or sexual incidents, national training standards in domestic violence for police, electronic document sharing and mutual disclosure of information. Police had assessed Ms Slack to be at at risk but it emerged during the five-week inquest at Derbyshire Coroner's Court that they were unclear if she had been warned. The inquest heard Andrew Cairns had a long history of mental health problems. In the weeks running up to the attack he had been detained under the Mental Health Act, assessed and released. The jury heard he had also been arrested for making threats to kill Ms Slack, and was later bailed. They were also told that following his contact with Derbyshire Constabulary, Ms Slack and Auden were deemed as being at high risk of homicide but police officers failed to properly impart that to Ms Slack. On the morning of 2 June, Cairns went to his GP and seemed agitated. When he left the surgery, he went to Ms Slack's home. A neighbour reported hearing screams coming from the house. Post-mortem examination results showed Ms Slack had been stabbed 32 times in the chest and back. Cairns had 18 stab wounds to his abdomen and chest and the inquest heard Auden, who had been stabbed 16 times, died from multiple wounds to his chest and abdomen. Ms Slack was pregnant at the time of her death and in a relationship with Robert Barlow. He said: "Knowing that Rachael was a high risk of homicide means that we could have adjusted our lives to be a lot more vigilant. "I think it's a key point that we definitely needed to know. I do in the long term think it would have made a difference, without a shadow of a doubt." Hayden and Melony Slack, Rachael Slack's brother and sister-in-law, said: "The space that has been left in our lives by the tragic loss of Rachael and Auden will never be filled and never should be. "Rachael was a devoted mother, a beautiful and truly caring person with a positive outlook on life. "We hope that the jury's findings that the police failings contributed to the deaths of Rachael and Auden, and the various reports to be made by the coroner, will ensure that lessons are learned that could protect the lives of other women and children threatened by domestic violence - a problem the coroner described as an 'epidemic'." In a statement Derbyshire Police Assistant Chief Constable Karl Smethem said: "I am confident that Derbyshire Constabulary's policies and procedures for the investigation of domestic violence incidents, and for the protection of victims, met national guidelines in 2010. "From the evidence it is clear that Rachael's report of Andrew Cairns' verbal threat to kill was taken very seriously by the police. "We were actively investigating the threat, with a view to charging him, and we did take steps to ensure that Rachael and Auden's home was secure." In a statement, the family of Andrew Cairns said mental health services failed to keep proper records or co-ordinate his care. </body>

      <body>Former BBC Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis has pleaded not guilty to 14 counts of indecent assault and one of sexual assault. He is accused of carrying out the offences between 1976 and 2008. The allegations relate to 11 female complainants, aged between 15 and 29 at the time. The 68-year-old appeared at Southwark Crown Court under his real name, David Patrick Griffin. His trial date was set for 14 January 2014. It is expected to last five to six weeks. Mr Travis, of Mentmore, Buckinghamshire, was first arrested on suspicion of sexual offences by Operation Yewtree officers in November last year. The Metropolitan Police investigation was launched in the wake of sexual offence allegations against ex-TV presenter and Radio 1 DJ Jimmy Savile. The operation has a number of strands. One is looking specifically at the actions of Savile, and the second at allegations of sexual offences against "Savile and others". Mr Travis's arrest fell within a third strand, relating to allegations against suspects unconnected to the Savile investigation. He is currently on bail on condition that he lives at his Buckinghamshire home and does not contact the alleged victims. Mr Travis denied the following counts in court on Tuesday: </body>

      <title>Dewani extradition appeal 'reopened'</title>
      <description>Honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani wins the right to appeal against his extradition to South Africa at the High Court.</description>

      <body>Honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani has won the right to have an appeal against his extradition to South Africa reopened at the High Court in London. It is the latest move by the 33-year-old Bristol businessman to halt his removal from the UK to face trial over his wife's death. Mr Dewani is accused of plotting to kill 28-year-old Anni Dewani, who was shot in Cape Town in November 2010. The High Court will hear the appeal as soon as possible. The extradition was first ordered by a senior district judge in 2011. It was appealed to the High Court in 2012, where it was sent back to the district judge. In July, Mr Dewani's extradition was ordered once again. The Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas has now said that the original appeal will be reopened to consider two questions: Speaking outside the court, Anni Dewani's mother Nilam Hindocha said it was "nearly three years since she was killed and we have kept our dignity and respect throughout". "I was brought up to believe British justice is the best in the world, so it is very hard to understand why we are still here. "I am the mother of a murdered daughter. How long do I have to wait?" Anni Dewani's sister, Ami Denborg said: "We've been waiting three years and we don't understand why there are so many delays. "We want Shrien to go to South Africa - it's taking a toll on us. "It's hard for us to move on with our lives.. It doesn't help anyone for him not to answer questions." Mr Dewani's family left court without making a statement. Mr Dewani is suspected of ordering the killing of his new wife as they drove through the Gugulethu township in a taxi. The pair were kidnapped at gunpoint. Mr Dewani was released unharmed, but the next day the body of Mrs Dewani was found on the back seat of the car in Lingelethu West, with injuries to her head and chest. Last year, South African Xolile Mngeni was convicted of premeditated murder and jailed for life. Prosecutors claimed he was a hitman hired by Mr Dewani to kill his wife, something that Mr Dewani has always denied. The couple's taxi driver Zola Tongo was jailed for 18 years after he admitted his part in the killing and another accomplice, Mziwamadoda Qwabe, also pleaded guilty to murder and was handed 25 years in prison. Mr Dewani's family have said that he remains committed to returning to South Africa "when his health would permit a full trial and when appropriate protections are in place for his health and safety". </body>

      <title>Co-op chair Len Wardle to step down</title>
      <description>The chairman of the Co-operative Group, Len Wardle, is to step down in May after six years in the role, on the day MPs criticise the former management for "shortcomings".</description>

      <body>The chairman of the Co-operative Group, Len Wardle, is to step down in May. Mr Wardle said he had informed the board in August of his decision. "The Co-operative Group is at its best when it is reforming and I want this change to continue," he said in a statement. On Monday, the mutual group said it would lose overall control of the Co-op Bank following a restructuring of a rescue deal, which will provide the bank with extra capital. The change means the group will end up holding just a 30% stake in the bank. Under its original plan it would have held a 70% stake. Mr Wardle's move comes just hours after the former chief executive of the Co-op Group, Peter Marks, appeared at the Treasury Committee of MPs to explain its decision to try to purchase 632 Lloyds bank branches. Co-op Bank pulled out of the deal in April, which is when its financial problems came to light. Speaking about the hearing, the chairman of the Treasury Committee, Andrew Tyrie, criticised the former management for its conduct, saying: "Being owned by a mutual, the Co-op Bank differed from most of its competitors. But on today's evidence, its shortcomings did not." "A lack of personal accountability at senior levels, ineffective corporate governance and insufficient experience and expertise among those taking the decisions. This has become a familiar story." In June, the Co-op Group announced a plan to plug a £1.5bn capital hole in Co-op Bank's balance sheet. The group intended to put in £1bn of capital itself, with £500m coming from bondholders and owners of preference shares. The bank would then have been floated, with Co-op Group holding a 70% share. However, the bank's creditors, led by US hedge funds, rejected the plan. Mr Marks said the mutual group's loss of overall control of the Co-op Bank was "a tragedy". However, he added that the plan to buy the bank branches from Lloyds had offered a "great opportunity". "The bank was sub-scale, it needed to build scale to compete and survive. Verde [the Lloyds branches] created a great opportunity to do that and bring in significant capital and a high quality chief executive," he said. Speaking about his departure, Mr Wardle, who chaired the group for six years, said he was "immensely proud" of his time there. "During the last year, we have appointed Euan Sutherland as group chief executive officer and started the changes that I believe will make The Co-operative Group stronger than ever," he added. Mr Sutherland said Mr Wardle's guidance meant the group had "made significant progress on beginning the reform which we will announce as planned in May 2014". </body>

      <body>A schoolboy who admitted robbing a bank with an imitation firearm has been sentenced to 40 months in a young offenders institution. Liverpool Youth Court had been told the 15-year-old boy acted as if he was in a "real-life video game". The teenager, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was described in court as a "model pupil". The court heard he stole more than £2,000 from a branch of Barclays in Liverpool on 20 September. He was handed to the police by his mother, who was shocked to find cash, stained with dye, and a fake gun in his bedroom. The teenager pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery last month and one count of possessing an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence. Passing sentence at Liverpool Crown Court, Judge Clement Goldstone QC told the boy: "However innocent you look now, as you sit in your smart suit, you did not look innocent when you held up bank staff at gunpoint and terrified them." The judge said the teenager had planned the robbery at that particular branch because he thought it would be a "soft touch". The judge said the boy's mother had shown "a remarkable display of public spirit" in reporting her son to police. Judge Goldstone said her actions were "all the more commendable" when compared to other cases where some parents were prepared to lie to protect their children when they knew they had committed serious crimes. He accepted the boy's remorse was genuine but said custody was necessary, not simply to punish him but to "show other boys that, if they choose to commit offences of this kind, they will be sent to detention". Kim Egerton, prosecuting, told the court that the robbery was carried out at 11:45 BST when a man was seen walking into the bank wearing a black Parka-style coat, with the hood up and a scarf covering his face. A black handgun was produced and the robber ordered the terrified cashier to fill a bag up with money, before adding: "Don't do anything stupid. I have just got out of prison after five years." She said the boy's mother discovered £2,200 stained with dye in a yellow draw-string bag while she was tidying his bedroom and "looking for socks". "Emptying the bag, she was horrified to discover the imitation firearm," Miss Egerton said. Theresa Loftus, defending, said the boy knew he had "brought shame on his family". She said the boy's mother had "clearly instilled in him" a real sense of family loyalty, duty and religious faith. She added that the boy was "an intelligent young man who has shown some educational promise". </body>

      <body>French police are to release an image of a man wanted in connection with the murders of four people in the Alps, the BBC understands. Three members of the al-Hilli family - a father, mother and grandmother - were murdered at point blank range, near Annecy in September 2012. The BBC's Hugh Schofield said police told French press they had the efit at the start of the investigation. "It was not released for fear the man would disguise himself," he said. Saad al-Hilli, 50, was shot with his wife Iqbal, 47, his mother-in-law Suhaila al-Allaf and French cyclist Sylvain Mollier near Annecy. His daughters Zainab, seven, and Zeena, four, survived. Prosecutor Eric Maillaud told the French press the image had been created at the start of the investigation but was not released "for strategic reasons". He said: "We did not want this person to be alerted into changing his appearance. "We cannot affirm that this man is the killer. What we do say is that the murders cannot have been the work of a single person. "The most likely theory is that the motorcycle arrived at the scene ahead of the al-Hilli car after using forest tracks," Brett Martin, a former RAF pilot who has a holiday home in the area, was on a cycle ride on 5 September 2012. He said he saw a motorcyclist leaving the scene of the shooting. "He was going at a very slow, abnormally slow speed, and at the time it seemed odd," he told BBC's Panorama programme. A forestry worker coming down from a nearby mountain just minutes before the shooting also spoke to the programme. He said: "When I arrived, there was a motorbike pulling in to the parking area. I passed the parking and the motorbike was on the left here. "I remember it well, it was white, white and black, with panniers on either side. "The rider was all in black [and] his visor was completely closed." French police have traced all the vehicles in the area that day except two - the motorbike and a grey four-by-four. Only Zaid al-Hilli, the brother of the driver of the car, has ever been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. He denies arranging the murders and has been re-bailed until 15 January, Surrey Police said. </body>

      <description>William Hague urges Arab and Western nations to encourage unity among Syria's moderate opposition and keep out extremists, at talks in London.</description>

      <body>Syria's moderate opposition should "commit itself fully" to planned peace talks, the Friends of Syria group of countries has said. The talks in Geneva next month offered Syrians the "best hope to improve their lives", UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said. Ministers have gathered in London to meet Syrian opposition officials. A key group in Syria's main opposition alliance has threatened to boycott the planned meeting, dubbed Geneva II. Mr Hague's US counterpart John Kerry said he believed and hoped the meeting would go ahead as planned but that Western countries could not control whether all parties would attend. Addressing the opposition, Mr Kerry said: "You can win at the negotiating table what it may take a long time and a lot of... loss of life to win on the battlefield." Ahmad Jarba, head of the main opposition grouping, the Syrian National Coalition (SNC), said the coalition would decide at a meeting next week whether to participate. The SNC has previously been unwilling to talk to representatives of Mr Assad's government. Mr Hague said the process envisaged by the Friends of Syria involved the establishment "by mutual consent" of "a transitional governing body with full executive powers". Participants at the first round of talks in June 2012 (Geneva I) had sought to end the civil war by getting Damascus and the opposition to choose a transitional government. Mr Hague reaffirmed the view of the Friends of Syria group - Britain, Egypt, France, Germany, Jordan, Italy, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United States - that Geneva II must be about a political transition in Syria away from the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Any transitional government could only be agreed with the consent of the SNC, and therefore Mr Assad would play no role in it, Mr Hague added. Mr Kerry said he expected representatives of the government to attend any talks and to "negotiate in good faith". Mr Hague and Mr Kerry also pledged further backing for Syria's moderate opposition, aimed at bolstering them in the face of rising influence extremists from power in the war-gripped country. Mr Jarba also spoke to reporters after meeting, outlining the steps that he considered necessary for the success of the Geneva talks. He called for safe corridors to be established to deliver humanitarian aid to opposition-held areas currently besieged by government forces. Mr Jarba also called for women and children he said were in regime custody to be released. He also expressed opposition to the idea of Iran having an active role in the process, accusing Iran of having tens of thousands of militiamen active in Syria. Iran as yet has no role in Geneva II, but Mr Hague earlier told the BBC he was trying to use new positive diplomatic relations with Iran to encourage it to play a "more constructive role". Also on Tuesday, the UN Special Co-ordinator for the mission to destroy Syria's chemical weapons, Sigrid Kaag, said in a statement that to date, the Syrian government had "fully co-operated" in the mission's work. Western officials have been buoyed by the initial results of the chemical disarmament effort, the BBC's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says. But he adds that they are painfully aware that the recent chemical deal has done nothing to alter the course of the civil war or to reduce the burgeoning humanitarian catastrophe in and around Syria. On Monday, Mr Assad told Lebanon's al-Mayadeen television that he saw no reason why he could not run for the presidency again. "Personally, I don't see any obstacles to being nominated to run in the next presidential elections," he was quoted as saying by the channel. Mr Assad told the channel that his government would take part in the conference without preconditions, but suggested the prospects that it would reach a settlement were, at present, dim. "No time has been set, and the factors are not yet in place if we want to succeed," he told al-Mayadeen. "Which forces are taking part? What relation do these forces have with the Syrian people? Do these forces represent the Syrian people, or do they represent the states that invented them?" he asked. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are key funders of opposition forces in Syria, including, it is believed, hardline Islamist groups. More than 100,000 people have been killed since the Syrian conflict began in 2011. The UN estimates that by the end of 2014 more than eight million Syrians could have been forced from their homes, including 5.2 million who will have fled the country. </body>

      <body>BBC Director General Tony Hall has said the BBC will broadcast a Panorama programme featuring allegations about Comic Relief, if they are true. Newspaper reports have claimed the investigation into several charities, is in danger of being "shelved". But Lord Hall told a parliamentary select committee he "very much" hoped it would be transmitted. He added: "I believe strongly in the BBC's ability to carry out investigative journalism." It was reported by The Mirror newspaper that the Panorama programme is looking into claims the charity has invested £150 million of its funds for up to eight years before passing money on to the causes for which it had been raised. There are also allegations that some of the money went to a fund which invested in tobacco firms and an arms company. Lord Hall is appearing before a Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee alongside Chairman of the BBC Trust, Lord Patten, to discuss the BBC's annual report. He was asked by Mr Philip Davies MP if the Panorama programme would be broadcast. "The thing I learned when I was last in the BBC… was that when you have a programme which is controversial, and right to be controversial, making big claims, and right to be making big claims, you shouldn't set a transmission date," said Lord Hall. He said programme makers "should set aside time" to talk to lawyers and check claims, adding "that's exactly what's happening with this programme." Lord Hall said he had discussed the programme directly with director of news, James Harding, adding "there's no string of BBC executives" making decisions about the programme. Comic Relief has called the claims "inaccurate" and "misleading". When pressed on whether the six-month investigation into charities' pay and investments would be broadcast, Lord Hall said: "I don't know yet. I very much hope this programme will be transmitted but I don't know yet what the substance of the allegations are, and whether they are right or wrong. "My aim is to get programmes on the air [and] I believe strongly in the BBC's ability to carry out investigative journalism." Lord Hall was asked by Ben Bradshaw MP if there were parallels with Newsnight's dropped Jimmy Savile investigation, and whether that was why staff had leaked the story to the press. "I don't know about the parallels," said Lord Hall. "This is a much clearer story which, if established, I think is a proper story to tell." "I've done a lot of programmes like this [in my previous career at the BBC]. We did all sorts of different stories. But what we needed from the journalists was to work through the implications of what they were saying and if they do that, they will have my complete support." Lord Hall added: "We are moving as quickly as we can." Both Lord Hall and Patten are appearing in front of the committee to discuss the findings of this year's BBC annual report, published in July this year. It revealed the BBC spent around £5m on three inquiries set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. The Pollard Review, which looked into Newsnight's dropped investigation into the presenter, cost £2.8m. The report also found public trust in the BBC had now almost recovered to previous levels, following the Savile and Newsnight crises. At the select committee hearing on Tuesday, Lord Hall was also questioned on the issue of bullying and harassment among staff at the BBC. The Respect at Work Review by Dinah Rose QC was published in May and suggested there was "a strong undercurrent of fear" at the BBC when addressing these issues. Lord Hall said the BBC had been working "very hard" on implementing the report's recommendations. "We are, this week, opening our first ever bullying and harassment support line to allow people to say if they think they are being bullied and harassed, and we are trying to deliver results on all the cases as quick as we can," he said. He confirmed a number of disciplinary hearings had been carried out and that in one case, the subject of the complaint was no longer working at the BBC. Lord Hall also stated that his new £150,000 cap on severance pay was "very real" and that it would be enforced on all of the 300 staff it applied to, despite around 20 senior managers disagreeing with the cap. When questioned on the issue of cuts to local radio by Tracey Crouch MP, Lord Hall agreed there was "a danger" of news being recycled as a result. However he added that he wanted to "be ambitious, with limited resources" with his plans for the BBC's 39 local stations. "There's a lot to do in partnership with local newspapers and other local organisations," he said, adding he wanted to do more to "reflect the quality of the arts, culture and other things going on in communities". </body>

      <body>A couple who engaged in a "sex act" in a Shrewsbury railway station lift are being sought, police have said. A man and woman were seen entering the lift, which connects the station's main subway to platforms four to seven, at about 19:25 BST on 28 September. British Transport Police said the pair "remained in the lift for more than 10 minutes and, during this time, performed an indecent act". CCTV images of two people police wish to speak to have been released. PC Kirk Smith said it was "particularly concerning, as the station was very busy and other passengers could have entered the lift at any time". "We have conducted a number of inquiries and isolated images of a man and woman we believe may have important information in relation to this incident." </body>

      <title>Great British Bake Off winner chosen</title>
      <description>The winner of this year's The Great British Bake Off is crowned by judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood, after series four's all-female final on BBC Two.</description>

      <body>Clothes designer Frances Quinn has been crowned 2014's winner of The Great British Bake Off. Quinn, 31, said she was in "complete and utter shock" after beating psychologist Kimberley Wilson and former model Ruby Tandoh. She baked a rainbow picnic pie to wow judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry on the fourth series of the BBC Two show. Quinn also created a three-tier wedding cake, inspired by Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins had billed Quinn, who lives in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, as "the most creative baker to ever set foot in the tent". She said she was looking forward to celebrating with family and friends, after having to keep her win under wraps since recording the final episode during the summer. "I've been back at work and trying to keep a poker face," said Quinn. "I remember watching the Wimbledon final the following week and getting so emotional... and thinking at least Andy Murray doesn't have to hide his trophy under his bed for the next three months." Quinn, who had been criticised at times by the judges for style over substance, said she was shocked to hear her name. "I don't think I could speak for a little while. It was so close, such a close final," she said. "I think it was the wedding cake at the end that really did swing it." Quinn's showstopper cake consisted of ginger and rhubarb, lemon sponge and raspberries and a third tier of carrot, orange, pistachio and apricot, while her savoury pie contained two types of trout and five different vegetables. The Great British Bake Off is set for a move to BBC One next year, after series four scored the show's highest ratings yet. Its audience has grown from an average of 2.8 million when it first began in 2010, peaking with 7.8 million a fortnight ago - making it the highest rated show on BBC Two so far this year. Controller of BBC One Charlotte Moore said she wanted to "bring the show to an even broader audience on BBC One". She continued: "It's been fantastic to watch it flourish on BBC Two and I can assure viewers I will continue to cherish it on BBC One." Hollywood called Quinn "a deserving winner", who beat the others "hands down" in the showstopper round. "She not only gave us the style, she gave us the substance too and that cake actually, each layer, superb," said Hollywood. Fellow judge Berry added: "She has attention to detail, she's got excellent flavours, her baking improved as each week went by. We're very proud of her." Quinn, who was persuaded to apply for Bake Off by family and friends, insisted there was no antagonism between the all-female finalists. "We all get on. People want to feel there was more competition than was the case," said Quinn. "The emotions you go through in that tent, you never want to see anyone get that criticism. Outside the tent we're just supportive of each other," she said. "It's a reality show but we know the actual reality that went on." Hours before the final was broadcast, chef Raymond Blanc apologised on Twitter after suggesting that the show's youngest contestant, Tandoh, 21, was too thin to enjoy food and had also won the competition. He later used the social networking site to say sorry to the show's co-host Hollywood, blaming his comments on the fact that he is a "Frenchman writing English" and saying he did not know who would be crowned winner. Quinn said she was not thinking of leaving her design job, although she has already been approached by agents and hopes to produce a book. "Work has been so, so supportive. I'm not going to say yea or nay to anything at the moment, I've got a mortgage to pay," she said. "The baking market is completely saturated so I don't want to do a book that's anything like one that's already out there. I'd like to create a book that's got all my rough sketches and ideas." She continued: "I don't know what the future is going to hold but it does excite me. What I'd love to do is combine both passions, baking and design." </body>

      <title>Queen visits National Theatre at 50</title>
      <description>The Queen meets one of the puppets from stage show War Horse during her tour of the National Theatre as the institution celebrates its 50th birthday.</description>

      <body>The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have visited the National Theatre, as the institution celebrates its 50th birthday. During the tour, the Queen met one of the puppet horses from the NT's acclaimed production of War Horse. The Queen has previously seen the show, based on Michael Morpurgo's novel, which tells the story of Joey, a horse who serves in World War I. NT director Sir Nicholas Hytner said it had been "a very special day". Tuesday is 50 years to the day since the first National Theatre production. Peter O'Toole played Hamlet on 22 October 1963 at the Old Vic theatre, the NT's original home, under the direction of its founder Sir Laurence Olivier. Among the cast in that first performance was the 23-year-old actor Michael Gambon. Speaking at a 50th anniversary talk at the National's Olivier Theatre on Tuesday night, Sir Michael recalled: "I never had to speak. I was just at the back with a spear." He added: "I used to walk out of the stage door at night at the Old Vic and put myself just behind Sir Laurence as he was going out to his car to seem as though I was one of his friends." Actress Sheila Reid, who appeared in Olivier's Othello in 1964, said that appearing stage with Sir Laurence "was a bit like playing tennis with somebody better than yourself". The NT moved to its current home on the South Bank in 1976. More than 800 productions have taken place over the last 50 years, including premieres of plays by Tom Stoppard, Peter Shaffer, Harold Pinter, Alan Bennett and David Hare. During their visit on Tuesday, the Queen and Prince Philip were were given a tour by outgoing director Sir Nicholas Hytner. They heard a musical number from Guys and Dolls, the first musical staged to be staged at the National in 1982, and watched a rehearsal for the forthcoming production Emil And The Detectives, based on the story of a boy living in 1920s Berlin. Dame Joan Plowright, who was married to Sir Laurence Olivier when he led the National Theatre, also met the Queen. The actress said: "It's a very special day, it's quite hard not to feel quite emotional about it. "I remember what the day was like when it was about to open - the nerves and apprehension. It's a huge task to take on the first season of a new national theatre." Dame Joan added: "It's had quite a history - I would say more triumphs then disasters." The Queen also unveiled a plaque to mark her visit and the 50th anniversary. Tuesday's encounter with War Horse puppet Joey wasn't the first time the Queen had met the mechanical star of the show, which is in the West End and abroad. During the Diamond Jubilee River Thames pageant last summer, the Queen appeared to enjoy watching the animal running across the roof of the National Theatre, which first staged the play, as the royal barge sailed past. As her tour of the theatre company ended, she told the puppet horse: "It's lovely to see you again." Puppeteer Gareth Aled said after meeting the Queen: "She's familiar with horses and with Joey, it's a very lovely privilege to have that meeting, she knows horses probably better than we do." Joey walked up to the Queen and followed her as she walked to her waiting state limousine before rearing up on his hind legs as the car departed. Mr Aled added: "It's all about striving for realistic horse movement, every horse movement should feel life-like." The National Theatre's 50th year is being marked by a series of events, including a star-studded gala on 2 November which will be shown on BBC Two. Famous alumni including Dame Judi Dench, Simon Russell Beale, Sir Michael Gambon, Sir Derek Jacobi and Dame Maggie Smith will perform speeches from roles they have played there. Dame Maggie will reprise her role as Mrs Sullen in George Farquhar's comedy The Beaux' Stratagem, Russell Beale will return to Hamlet, while Dame Judi, who appeared in Antony and Cleopatra in 1987, will re-enact the elegy to Antony. "I'm frightened, but I'm thrilled to be part of it," Dame Judi told the BBC. Sir Nicholas Hytner even hinted to the Evening Standard that blockbuster show The History Boys, which launched the career of James Corden, could even make a return for the gala. Dame Judi said the institution was still "essential" as it celebrated its golden anniversary. "The place is absolutely buzzing with people," she told BBC entertainment correspondent Lizo Mzimba. "There are exhibitions, there is music, there are three theatres going. It's a very alive place. "We need that to stimulate our emotions. We need to see things that make us cry, laugh, think about something, be excited, be saddened, be angry. "We were so long without a National Theatre," she added, "and we've been very, very lucky." Sir Nicholas Hytner leaves the National Theatre in 2015, when he will be replaced by Rufus Norris, whose credits include The Amen Corner and Dr Dee: An English Opera. The role is widely regarded as the biggest job in British theatre. Norris, who was appointed last week, called it "a great honour". </body>

      <description>Police in the Republic of Ireland remove a seven-year-old blonde girl from a Roma family in Dublin.</description>

      <body>Police in the Republic of Ireland have removed a seven-year-old blonde girl from a Roma family in Dublin. The girl was taken into care after officers called to a house in Tallaght on Monday afternoon. They saw a number of children, including the seven-year-old girl who has blonde hair and blue eyes. The parents told police the child was their daughter, but officers were not satisfied with the explanation nor with the documents that were produced. The Sunday World newspaper reported that a birth certificate was believed to have eventually been produced but officers were not satisfied with it. The paper reported that although the couple claimed the child was born in the Coombe hospital in Dublin in 2006, the hospital had no record of the child being born on the date quoted by the parents. The child was removed from the family under powers in the Child Care Act. It is understood the child is now in the care of the Health Service Executive (HSE). An interim care order is being sought, under which the child can remain in care for up to 28 days while a police investigation continues. Police had been told by a member of the public that a six or seven-year-old girl was living with a large Roma family and looked nothing like any of her siblings. Last week a young blonde girl was found during a raid on a Roma camp in central Greece. A Roma couple have been formally charged with abducting the girl, named Maria, and have been placed in detention pending a trial. DNA tests showed that she was not related to the couple, who insist they were given her legitimately. Maria is being cared for by a charity in Athens, which has received more than 8,000 calls after an appeal. The case has brought a response from two families in the UK with long-missing children. Ben Needham from Sheffield disappeared aged 21 months while on a family holiday on the Greek island of Kos in 1991. His sister said the discovery of the blonde-haired girl in central Greece gave them "great hope". A spokesman for Kate and Gerry McCann, whose three-year-old daughter Madeleine went missing in Portugal in 2007, said the case also gave them hope that she would one day be found alive. </body>

      <title>Poots cannot appeal adoption ruling</title>
      <description>The health minister cannot appeal the high court's decision to allow gay and unmarried couple in Northern Ireland to adopt.</description>

      <body>The health minister cannot appeal the high court's decision to allow gay and unmarried couples in Northern Ireland to adopt. The Supreme Court said the Department of Health's argument for appeal did not meet the criteria. In June, the Court of Appeal ruled that legislation that prevents civil partners adopting was unlawful - but Edwin Poots appealed that decision. The Supreme Court said there were no grounds for an appeal and dismissed it. Mr Poots tried to challenge an appeal court's decision that paved the way for gay and lesbian couples to adopt children in Northern Ireland. A spokesman for the UK's top court said: "The Supreme Court of the UK has refused permission to appeal the Court of Appeal's decision in this matter." At present a single gay or lesbian person can adopt in Northern Ireland but a couple in a civil partnership cannot. Mr Poots said: "It is with disappointment that I note that the request for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused. "I am currently carefully considering the implications for the Adoption and Children Bill, which is currently being drafted and which I intend to introduce in the assembly next year." A challenge to the legislation was mounted by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, which was backed by an unidentified lesbian woman who wants to enter into a civil partnership and be able to adopt her partner's biological child. Unmarried couples in Great Britain can apply jointly to be considered for adoption irrespective of sexual orientation. But anyone unmarried in Northern Ireland is only eligible for consideration as an individual. Those in civil partnerships cannot apply individually or as a couple. The commission challenged the law on the grounds that certain provisions were unjustifiably discriminatory to those in homosexual relationships, in contravention of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Court of Appeal in Belfast ruled in the commission's favour and against Mr Poots' department in June. The department then applied for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court on a point of law. The Supreme Court spokesman added: "The Supreme Court issued an order on 22 October 2013 stating that the application did not satisfy the criteria of raising an arguable point of law of general public importance." The refusal of the Supreme Court in London to grant the further appeal on adoption law was welcomed by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. Chief Commissioner, Professor Michael O'Flaherty said: "The commission brought this case to ensure that the best interests of children in Northern Ireland would be protected. "Unmarried couples, those in same sex relationships and civil partnerships are eligible to be considered to be adoptive parents. "All of the judgements and today's rejection by the Supreme Court to hear a further appeal confirmed that the law in Northern Ireland was out of step with the United Kingdom's human rights obligations." Alliance Party MLA Kieran McCarthy said: "Edwin Poots' position as health minister has been seriously undermined by successive legal failures over adoption by civil partners and the ban on gay men donating blood. "He has continued to waste public money on his own personal campaigns despite several failures in the courts. "The minister must do what is right and urgently allow civil partners the opportunity to apply to adopt. He must accept this decision and cease any further legal action. "There are too many children in our care system for us to be deciding who has the right to apply to adopt a child. It should be about whether a couple can provide a loving and safe home for a child." Sinn Fein MLA Maeve McLaughlin who is the chair of the Health Committee has called on the minister to reveal how much money has been spent on the legal challenge. "This is a sensible and logical decision and one that will be welcomed widely. It is a decision that is against discrimination and for equality," she said. The Green Party leader Steven Agnew added that the minister had "over-stepped his legislative boundaries". "Surely questions must now be asked about his competency as a minister especially since his continual trips to court to try to push his own agenda is at the expense of the public purse," he said. The SDLP have said the policy around adoption needs to be "immediately rectified". "The Minister must confirm that legislation will now be brought forward to rectify this situation. I believe not to do so would mean that the Minister is not fulfilling the requirements of his office and he would be left with no alternative but to depart that office," said Alex Attwood. The Rainbow Project said they hoped the ruling would bring an end to the "discriminatory practice" in Northern Ireland. </body>

      <body>Health bosses have vowed to launch legal proceedings to move French travellers who are blocking a car park used by hospital workers. Officials had asked the travellers to move 13 caravans from the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport by 16:00 BST on Tuesday. However the travellers - who are taking up 65 spaces - said they would not leave until Wednesday. The travellers arrived at the 300-space car park late Saturday on afternoon. Surgeons, doctors and nurses were turned away on Monday, but a hospital spokesman said patient services had not been disrupted. After visiting the site on Tuesday morning, Jamie Marchant, director of facilities at the Aneurin Bevan Health Board, told BBC Radio Wales: "I have spoken to a few of the travellers and they're very friendly and very amicable. "They have indicated to us previously that they are moving on tomorrow [Wednesday]. "They've also indicated they are parked up for a funeral." After the Tuesday afternoon deadline passed, Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, which runs the hospital, said it was now resorting to the law. "As you will be aware, the health board has requested that the travellers leave our hospital car park by 4pm today," a board member said. "Given that the travellers are still here following our request, the health board confirms that it will now be taking legal proceedings to take back possession of the hospital car park." Julian Hayman, a spokesman for the hospital, said security staff would remain in the car park and that the situation would continue to be monitored. He added it was hoped the travellers would leave of their own accord without the need for potentially costly legal proceedings. "However, this has been passed to our legal department now and it will be dealing with the situation from here," he said. </body>

      <body>Wales' four rugby regions have backed the Anglo-French plan for a revamped European competition from next season. Cardiff Blues, Ospreys, Scarlets and Newport Gwent Dragons released a statement via umbrella body, Regional Rugby Wales (RRW). RRW says some new tournament details need finalising, but added: "It is now clear there are a number of significant advantages to the new competitions." The Welsh Rugby Union has been asked to comment. Europe's top teams currently compete in the Heineken Cup or second-tier Amlin Challenge Cup. England's Aviva Premiership clubs and their French Top 14 counterparts announced in June 2012 their intention to leave the competition organised by European Rugby Cup Ltd. They did so in the belief that ERC has not made the most of commercial opportunities and that qualification for Europe is skewed in favour of Celtic and Italian teams. The English and French also believe that tournament funds have not been fairly distributed. And their contention that Pro12 teams have an unfair advantage in largely not having to battle for European places via that competition has caused simmering resentment for several seasons. Wales have automatically seen at least three teams enter Europe's top tier, no matter where they finish in the Pro12. The same is the case for Ireland's four teams plus two from each of Scotland and Italy. The statement read: "Regional Rugby Wales (RRW) on behalf of the four Welsh regions confirms its full support for the proposed new Rugby Champions Cup Competitions. "Whilst there remain elements of detail to be confirmed, it is now clear that there are a number of significant advantages to the new competitions in equality of governance, format, qualification and distribution across the individual participating clubs. "Consequently, RRW looks forward to working with the WRU to support their efforts and positive engagement in striving to ensure our teams are involved in strong, valuable European clubs competitions in time for next season." </body>

      <title>Buyer sought for Grangemouth plant</title>
      <description>The Scottish government is trying to find a buyer for the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemicals plant which is at the centre of an industrial dispute.</description>

      <body>The Scottish government is trying to find a buyer for the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemicals plant. Scotland's Finance Secretary John Swinney said ministers had been having discussions "with other players". An ongoing dispute between owners Ineos and the union Unite has resulted in the plant being temporarily closed. Ineos has said it will make an announcement to workers on Wednesday on the future of the complex. UK ministers have held talks with Scottish ministers to discuss the situation. They urged both sides to get round the negotiating table. Grangemouth plays an important part in bringing ashore North Sea oil and supplies petrol and diesel to the whole of Scotland and the north of England. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Swinney said: "I don't think it will come as any surprise to anyone that the government is looking for alternative options and there certainly will be other players around the globe interested in this particular plant. "We have certainly had discussions with other players and the Scottish government will engage in any discussions that are helpful to ensure Grangemouth can continue to make a major contribution to the health and well-being of the Scottish economy." He added that government ownership was "not appropriate" and that there was a "buyer out there". Scottish Energy Minister Fergus Ewing joined talks by telephone on Tuesday afternoon with Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael and UK Energy Minister Michael Fallon. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Newsdrive programme, Mr Carmichael said: "There is a real imperative for them [Ineos and Unite] - not just for the future of the Grangemouth plant, but for the wider Scottish economy - to get back to the table, to get talking, to explore the issues that require to be explored in good faith and with a view to getting the plant operational as soon as possible. "Frankly nothing else is as important as that at the moment." The Scottish secretary also said both governments were making "contingency plans" for the Grangemouth site, if the owners decide not to reopen it. Senior figures from Ineos met in London earlier to discuss the outcome of their challenge to the workforce to accept reduced pay and pension. Responding to Mr Swinney's comments on talks about a takeover of the site, Declan Sealy, a director for Ineos at Grangemouth, said: "Like every business, we look at buying and selling assets and businesses all the time. "Our focus here today is on trying to implement a survival plan that brings a future for Grangemouth." However, it is not thought there has been any discussion with Ineos of a sale or a different operator. Unite said it would support the Scottish government in whatever way it could "to ensure a secure future for Grangemouth and its working community". The union's Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, said Mr Swinney's intervention was a "welcome" one. He added: "This site is so key to the Scottish economy, so key to the UK economy, it cannot be treated the way it is being treated. "It cannot be used in a Russian roulette type of way of 'we get what we want or we close this site down'. It is just so irresponsible and that type of behaviour cannot be tolerated. "This site cannot close, that's not an option and it does have a future, a really good, bright future." Unite said half of the 1,350-strong workforce had rejected Ineos' proposed change to contracts. The company gave employees until 18:00 on Monday to accept plans, including a pay freeze and downgrading of pensions. The union said the refusal of the workforce to accept the new contract terms was a mandate to return to talks and fire up the plant. It was shut down last week by Ineos in response to a strike threat over the disciplining of a union representative at the complex. Ineos had said the plant would close without new investment and changes to workers' terms and conditions. The firm said it would communicate the shareholders' views directly to the workforce on Wednesday. However, Ineos has warned a decision on the plant's fate could take several days. A spokesman added: "Ineos is now considering the numbers of employees that have given their support to its survival plan. "Consultations on the survival plan formally began last Thursday. It will take 45 days before any changes to terms and conditions can be introduced and 60 days before any changes to pensions can be implemented." Majority shareholder Jim Ratcliffe has said if the petro-chemical plant goes, the neighbouring refinery is unlikely to survive. He has also said Ineos may not be willing to pay the cost of a prolonged shutdown. Finance Secretary Mr Swinney repeated the Scottish government's calls for the firm to "fire up the plant" and urged both sides to avoid "the clear danger of a stalemate". He added: "The trade union has given, in my estimation, a very clear and unequivocal commitment that there will be no industrial action this side of Christmas, and indeed last night the union said there would be no strike action well into 2014. "I think we should take these commitments at face value, accept them, and get the plant operating again." The refinery, which has an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes, provides most of the fuel in Scotland, Northern England and Northern Ireland. The petrochemicals facility at the site manufactures more than two million tonnes of chemical products per year, which are later transformed into essential items such as bottles and pipes, cabling and insulation and food packaging. </body>

      <body>Police have issued a facial reconstruction image in a bid to identify a man whose badly-decomposed body was found in Glasgow. The body was found in woods near Golf Course Road, at Glen Orchard Road, Balmore, on 19 October 2011. It may have been there for six to nine months. There were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the man's death. Despite previous appeals and extensive inquiries, police have, so far, been unable to establish his identity. The man was described as white, between 20 and 35 years old and between 5ft 8in and 6ft 1in tall, with light brown hair. He was wearing a light-blue polo shirt from Topshop, a blue jacket with a knitted white band around the collar. It has "Southern Green Pennsylvania" motif written on the left side of the chest. He was also wearing blue jeans and dark training shoes. Det Sgt Kerr Duncan, who has worked on the inquiry, said: "Sadly, despite previous appeals and extensive police enquiries carried out, this man has not been identified. "I hope that the images released today of a facial reconstruction and the man's clothing will jog someone's memory, and finally we may be able to find out who this man is and contact his family." Anyone with information is asked to contact police. The facial reconstruction image was produced by a team of forensic anthropologists at Dundee University's Centre for Anatomy and Human Identification. </body>

      <body>A man whose car became embedded in the side of a house in Suffolk has been banned for two years after admitting drink-driving and careless driving. Lewis Richardson's Audi TT left the road in Carlton Colville, Lowestoft, and crashed into a family home. Lowestoft magistrates were told the impact early on 24 March was just below where a five-year-old was sleeping. The 22-year-old, of Lowestoft, was "extremely sorry" and still suffering from serious injuries, the court heard. He had driven his car after an argument with his girlfriend and was a man of previous good character, magistrates were told. Richardson, of Hidesley Court, had since been to the Long Meadow Walk house to apologise to the family. He has received treatment for speech and sight problems and depression. The court heard the girl who was asleep in the house at the time still suffers from sleep problems. Magistrates disqualified Richardson from driving and fined him £650. </body>

      <body>A school has been forced to close because of an outbreak of Britain's most venomous spider. The Dean Academy, in the Forest of Dean, said it "had identified an issue with false widow spiders" in its ICT block and other areas of the site. A letter from vice-principal Craig Burns to parents said the school would be shut on Wednesday to be fumigated. Conservationists believe a change in the climate could be the cause of an increase in sightings of the species. In the letter, Mr Burns said the school had taken immediate pest control advice on discovery of the spiders. Initially the decision was taken to close the ICT block but further discoveries of the species elsewhere have led to a full school closure. "This will enable pest control to fumigate every area in the academy and ensure everyone's health and safety," Mr Burns wrote. "There have been no reports of anyone being bitten by the false widow spiders at the academy but if you have any concerns please seek medical advice." The school is expected to be open as normal on Thursday. The false widow (Steatoda nobilis) is about the size of a 50p coin and is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known in Britain. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Symptoms can include severe swelling, chest pains and tingling of fingers, with the severity depending on the amount of venom injected. Gloucestershire spider recorder David Haigh said people would have to be "very unlucky" to be bitten by one as they do not move very quickly and are not aggressive. He said he has never heard of a school being closed due to spiders, but said recent media attention on the False Widow has led to greater awareness. </body>

      <body>Five players at Premiership clubs tested positive for recreational drugs last season. In its annual anti-doping report, the Rugby Football Union said the cases would be treated confidentially and punished with a "first-strike fine". The tests came under the RFU's Illicit Drugs Programme, a series of out-of competition tests. In 617 tests for performance-enhancing drugs, none were failed by Premiership players. Testing for illicit drugs - cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines and ecstasy - was introduced in 2009 after four Bath players were suspended for substance use. The players who returned positive samples will be offered counselling and will remain anonymous unless they transgress again. Senior players who fail tests are fined £5,000, with a £1,000 fine given to academy players. "The RFU, Premiership Rugby and the Rugby Players' Association are focused on protecting the health and welfare of the players and reputation of the game, which is why this was set up in 2010," said an RFU statement. "We believe our strategy based on education, testing, deterrent and treatment will keep the number of test violations consistently low." Five players of National League One level or below failed in-competition tests aimed at performance-enhancing substances. </body>

      <title>Root given England central contract</title>
      <description>Joe Root is awarded a central contract by the England &amp; Wales Cricket Board for 2013-14, with Eoin Morgan missing out.</description>

      <body>Yorkshire batsman Joe Root has been awarded a central contract by the England and Wales Cricket Board for 2013-14, with Eoin Morgan losing his. Since his debut in December, Root has scored two Test centuries and helped England win the Ashes series 3-0. One-day specialist Morgan has not played a Test since February 2012. The contracts form part of a six-year deal with the players' union, which could give England players more time to play in the Indian Premier League. England players have traditionally struggled to win lucrative IPL contracts because a clash with the domestic international season makes them unavailable for much of the competition. "We will be handling that year by year but there is an understanding to try and minimise unnecessary overlap between our season and the IPL season," said Angus Porter, chief executive of the Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA). "We have agreed that (with the ECB) in principle." Root was one of 11 players to receive contracts, with fast bowlers Steven Finn and Tim Bresnan also rewarded. National selector Geoff Miller said: "Congratulations to Joe Root, who is the one addition to the list of players awarded a central contract. "This reflects the important role Joe has played for England since making his international debut last year and will I'm sure continue to play across all formats." Confirmation of the new contracts comes one day before England depart for Australia for the defence of the Ashes urn. The ECB had originally intended to sign them off at the end of September, but were delayed by negotiations with the PCA. In a joint statement, both parties confirmed they had reached an agreement on arrangements for England contracts for a period lasting until October 2019, to include four Ashes series and five ICC global events. ECB managing director Hugh Morris said: "We are delighted to have concluded a six-year deal and to have all contractual issues resolved in advance of what we all hope to be another successful Ashes tour." Porter added: "I am pleased that we have secured a fair and appropriate long-term agreement, and have done so via amicable and constructive dialogue." Finn was dropped after a disappointing performance in the first Ashes Test in July, but kept his place for the one-day and T20 matches against Australia and is in the squad for the tour down under. Yorkshire fast bowler Bresnan will also fly out with the squad to continue his rehabilitation from a stress fracture of the back and is hoping to play some part in the series. England central contracts for 2013-14: James Anderson, Ian Bell, Tim Bresnan, Stuart Broad, Alastair Cook, Steven Finn, Kevin Pietersen, Matt Prior, Joe Root, Graeme Swann and Jonathan Trott. </body>

      <title>The cult of the French pastry chef</title>

      <body>No French high street would be complete without a patisserie, and words such as "gateau", "eclair" and "flan" indicate that French pastry chefs are esteemed as much abroad as at home. But in the last couple of years, patissiers have shot to stardom, joining the top ranks of France's celebrity chefs. French patisserie used to be delicious but predictable - the chocolate eclair, the vanilla or raspberry flavoured macaroon, the classic French apple tart or the mille-feuille (a sophisticated vanilla slice). Something has changed. Ever heard of the caramel popcorn, pistachio-orange or pecan eclair by Christophe Adam? Or the olive-oil macaroon with mandarin orange and cucumber water by Pierre Herme? These are a couple of the audacious creations a new generation of French pastry chefs have launched on a startled but delighted French public. France has always loved patisserie, but for some reason it now loves its patissiers more than ever. Their books are filling the shelves of book shops, and their stores are multiplying - five new "patisseries de luxe" opened in the month of September, in Paris alone. And while The Great British Bake Off has gone from strength to strength, France has developed its own competitive baking shows, such as this year's Who Will be the Next Great Patissier? For the last episode contestants had to make a piece of fashion out of chocolate. Another show, The Gateau of My Dreams, where a chef goes to someone's house to help them bake a challenging cake or dessert, began in February 2012 - starting with mille-feuille with caramelised maple syrup, and Black Forest gateau with acidulated morello cherry - and published a spin-off book in its first year. One explanation for the sudden rise of the pastry chef is as a consequence of the recession. In these times of crisis, patisserie has become a relatively affordable luxury - compared say with going to the restaurant - says Sebastien Gaudard, one of today's up-and-coming pastry chefs. He has noticed a change in his customers' habits. Instead of buying a big cake for a Sunday lunch or a dinner party, couples are now more likely to visit during the week to buy one or two patisseries for themselves alone. Patisserie, he says, is a form of comfort food. "What drives the world of sweets, I think, is that eating sweets brings us back to a time in our lives when we had no worries, the carefree time of childhood." But the growing enthusiasm for patisserie is also due to the fact that a new generation of pastry chefs have re-invented their craft, according to Zakari Benkhadra, managing director of the Ecole Nationale Superieure de la Patisserie (ENSP), in the countryside south of Lyon. Chefs have started to make elaborate and visually interesting creations using techniques such as mixing sweetness and saltiness (salty macaroons), creating original shapes (an audio cassette shaped pistachio-chocolate bar) or making surprising high-quality desserts using mainstream products such as Haribo sweets and Nutella. A parallel piece of culinary invention, which made headlines earlier this year, was the cronut - a cross between a croissant and a donut - created by French chef Dominique Ansel in New York. The patisserie craze has had a direct impact on the ENSP's enrolment numbers. Struggling to fill some classes in 2008, it now turns away some applicants for lack of space. But not all the top patissiers are modernising traditional recipes and improvising with new tastes. Sebastien Gaudard represents another trend, which is to return to authentic and relatively simple creations. "My wish is to render the past marvellously present," says Gaudard, 43. Gaudard, the son of a famous pastry chef in Lorraine, eastern France, is one of a number of contemporary pastry chefs who served an apprenticeship at the Paris institution, Fauchon, which is famed above all for its patisserie. Since November 2011 he has run a shop in the ninth arrondissement of Paris, selling delicacies from the past that are no longer always available in every patisserie. These include the Puits d'amour, a dessert created by the 18th Century chef Vincent La Chapelle, its hollow centre stuffed with vanilla cream, and the classic Paris-Brest, made of choux pastry and a praline-flavoured cream, inspired by the Paris-Brest-Paris cycle race - its circular shape representing a bicycle wheel. A speciality is the Mussipontain a cake made of meringue, vanilla cream and caramelised almonds whose name derives from the inhabitants of the city of Pont-à-Mousson, Gaudard's home town. This is his father's own creation. But whether people prefer startling creativity or traditional pastries, all pastry chefs are out to please their customers - and the customers evidently enjoy being pleased. "We sell pleasure," says Gaudard. "People come to us for pleasure." </body>

      <title>Smashed Hits: The Windmills Of Your Mind</title>
      <description>The Windmills Of Your Mind was made famous by Noel Harrison, who's died aged 79. Why has it stood the test of time?</description>

      <body>"Round... like a circle in a circle, a wheel within a wheel..." so begins The Windmills Of Your Mind, made famous by Noel Harrison. Why has the song lasted so long, asks Ben Milne. Only two minutes and 20 seconds long in the version by Harrison, who's died aged 79, Windmills of Your Mind is a rush of lyrical free association about turning circles, spirals and the passage of time ("The autumn leaves were turning to the colour of her hair"). With its imagery of "a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own" and apples "whirling silently in space" Windmills occupies a singular place in the pop canon where psychedelia and easy listening meet. "It's a very peculiar and intriguing song," says Bob Stanley, musician and author of pop history Yeah Yeah Yeah. "It gets called easy listening but really isn't at all." Stanley says the song was the product of a short-lived era, post-Sgt Pepper, "where what had been the straight set... jumped on the psychedelia bandwagon". It was written by French composer Michel Legrand, with English lyrics by husband-and-wife team Alan and Marilyn Bergman (a French version, Les Moulins de mon coeur, was also penned by Eddy Marnay) and was used to memorable effect in the Steve McQueen thriller The Thomas Crown Affair (it won the Oscar for best song in 1968). But what do the lyrics mean? The poet Ian McMillan says Windmills Of Your Mind is similar to some modernist poetry where meanings are kept deliberately mysterious and confusing. He thinks the lyrics are deceptively shallow and warns poetry students not to use them as a template: "People will write something like 'the walls of my despair' or 'the settee of my soul'. 'Windmills of your mind' is a great phrase, and it's a fantastic song, but the words appear to mean something when they don't." Nevertheless the song has become a standard, covered by more than 80 recording artists, as diverse as Dusty Springfield, ex-Specials singer Terry Hall, the Muppets and Kiri Te Kanawa. But for many, it's Noel Harrison's version which still endures, as he delivers in his clipped English accent, "Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that she said?"

      <title>Pink Lady v the British apple</title>
      <description>It's the height of the British apple season, but are home-grown varieties in danger from vigorously marketed foreign rivals like Pink Lady and Jazz?</description>

      <body>National Apple Day marks the height of the British season, but are home-grown varieties in danger from vigorously marketed foreign rivals like Pink Lady and Jazz, asks Sebastian Oake. How many people will be popping down to the shops today for an old-fashioned apple? Maybe some Cox's Orange Pippin, Egremont Russet or Worcester Pearmain? But you'll be lucky to find more than one or two traditional British varieties - those that were originally bred in the UK and are still grown on British soil. These are in danger of becoming dwindling heritage curiosities, ousted from both shops and orchards by new names. Sales of Cox, Russet and Worcester have been falling year-on-year, while Gala and Braeburn have been rising. Gala, with its spin-off Royal Gala, is now the biggest-selling eating apple grown in the UK and total sales, including imports, are more than four times that of Cox. But it's an apple of New Zealand origin. Braeburn too was first grown in New Zealand but now has a foot in the door of British orchards. And two more recently developed varieties from Down Under are set to complete the takeover of the market. Jazz is another New Zealand apple, produced in the 1980s by crossing Gala and Braeburn. Trial plantings began in England in 2002 with volume production achieved by 2007. Pink Lady was bred in Australia in 1973 as a cross between Lady Williams and Golden Delicious. It became available in British shops in the early 1990s. Gala, Braeburn, Jazz and Pink Lady - the Antipodean Four - are now increasingly dominating apple shelves in the UK, but why? Tastes are changing, says Adrian Barlow, chief executive of English Apples and Pears, a trade association for the industry. "People want sweeter apples, they want a crunchier texture and they want a good skin finish. That's why many new varieties have become successful." English Apples and Pears represents the bulk of the commercial orchard acreage in England. Its members currently grow about 25 apple varieties. Of those just nine are what might be called "old English". Barlow looks back to when the UK joined the Common Market in the 1970s. The door was opened to imports of Granny Smith and Golden Delicious, which took market share from Cox. Now these two are themselves in decline, victims also of the Antipodean Four. Worldwide Fruit, a marketing and distribution company, controls the Jazz brand in the UK. Commercial director Steve Maxwell says: "There is definitely a long-term trend - the market for Cox is declining. Pink Lady and Jazz are consistent. Week in, week out, they always deliver on flavour." The shift towards Pink Lady and Jazz certainly isn't about price. Pink Lady can be anything up to twice the price of Cox. In Tesco last week, Braeburn was £1.95/kg, Cox £1.75/kg and Pink Lady £3.50/kg. Some believe that lack of choice in supermarkets is behind the shift in tastes. Among those who are scathing is Common Ground, a charity that champions local distinctiveness. It set up National Apple Day in 1990. "Supermarkets say they're responsive to consumer demand but I don't know how that operates," says Adrian Cooper, director of Common Ground. "If the range available in the shops is limited, then how do we express our demand? It's very difficult to know if the change in the market is due to changes in consumer taste or whether it's driven by a different force." There's no doubt that some apples are more profitable to produce than others. A single Gala tree reportedly produces a higher yield than native English varieties and a much higher proportion of Gala fruit passes as Class I fruit than Cox. The apples are just the right size, shape and colour to get top price. Supermarkets rarely sell Class II. There's little question too that in today's all-year-round market, supermarkets prefer not to fiddle about. For them, it's easier to place a contract with a single distribution company able to supply the same apple whatever the time of year, using different growing regions around the world in rotation. Worldwide Fruit can supply Royal Gala, Braeburn, Jazz and Pink Lady, 12 months a year. By contrast, it can supply Worcester Pearmain only in September. One huge factor in the snakes-and-ladders world of apples is the degree to which a variety is marketed and the muscle behind it. This is where Jazz and Pink Lady differ from many other varieties. To be accurate, Jazz and Pink Lady are not apple varieties but commercial brands. Jazz is the trademark brand name for the variety Scifresh. It was developed through a collaboration between Enza, formerly the New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board, and Plant and Food Research, a New Zealand research institute, and can only be grown under licence. In the UK it is controlled by Worldwide Fruit, itself part owned by Enza. Pink Lady is also a trademark - the actual variety is Cripps Pink. The brand is owned and licensed by Apple and Pear Australia. It is grown, with permission, in a range of countries but not in the UK. UK growers are not allowed to grow it because the trademark holder is worried the climate will not do it justice. The effort put into pushing brands like Pink Lady is phenomenal. The apple has a website, Facebook page and Twitter account. Women dressed up as apples have been targeting people at London stations and there has been a tie-in with Great Ormond Street Hospital. There is a logo for the apple, an official slogan ("so much more than an apple") and even the Pink Lady Club to sign up to. Through that you can access a chatroom, events and in-store promotions and, in a sign that much of the marketing is targeting children, the Pink Lady Club provides party packs (including the "Pink Lady apple song"), activity sheets and kids' recipes. Parents can even upload a picture of their child eating a Pink Lady apple to the Pink Lady website. In 2011 the people behind the Pink Lady brand promotion won an award from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. It's worth noting too that in all official material relating to the brand, the words Pink Lady come with an inseparable R in a circle reminding us all that this is Pink Lady® and someone's commercial property. Even the slogan "so much more than an apple" is trademarked. It all sounds a world away, and perhaps it is, from the classic image of an old English orchard.

      <title>Would-be MPs 'should be vetted'</title>
      <description>Would-be MPs should be forced to meet "pre-qualification criteria" before being allowed to stand, says former Cabinet Secretary Lord O'Donnell.</description>

      <body>Would-be MPs should be forced to meet "pre-qualification criteria" before being allowed to stand, a former cabinet secretary has suggested. Lord O'Donnell - once the UK's most senior civil servant - said the idea could make Parliament more effective. Government policies would also be vetted by former ministers, accountants and ex-civil servants under Lord O'Donnell's proposals. He said radical change was needed as the country was in a "bad place". In an article for The Political Quarterly, the former civil service chief said: Lord O'Donnell did not spell out what criteria he thought candidates for Parliament should meet. But a Cabinet Office source dismissed the idea. The source said: "It is not clear who would oversee the pre-qualification of Parliamentary candidates, and for what purpose. At present they undergo rigorous scrutiny by the electorate. It's called democracy" Lord O'Donnell said MPs could get training to prepare them for jobs as ministers. He wrote: "There are very few jobs that do not require individuals to undertake training and development before being promoted, so this would bring MPs into line with the reality of their constituents' lives." A new body called the Office for Taxpayer Responsibility would be established to vet both government policies and opposition manifestos. He wrote: "The rising trend in obesity, the growth of dementia and Alzheimer's and mental health issues in general make it hard to see how the state can afford to help all who need it." Falling potential economic growth and an increasing demand on public services created a "vicious pincer movement", he said. Voters were put off politics by the way politicians behaved on occasions like Prime Minister's Questions, and some new MPs were already disillusioned with their jobs. They increasingly faced a choice between free, but second rate, public services and expensive private provision. "We are in a bad place," wrote the former cabinet secretary. "But it is a stable bad place." Despite rejecting Lord O'Donnell's ideas for parliamentary candidates, the Cabinet Office source accepted improvements were needed. He said: "The current leadership of the Civil Service have identified serious deficiencies in capabilities, in talent management and development, and in a culture that too often stifles innovation and has a bias to inertia. "That's why together we are implementing a programme of Civil Service reform to deal with these issues which had been ignored for far too long." </body>

      <title>Facebook adds alerts to death clips</title>
      <description>Facebook adds warning signs to videos of beheadings and other instances of graphic violence, but its safety advisors still have concerns.</description>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70637000/jpg/_70637328_facebook.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Facebook has begun adding warning messages to videos on its site showing decapitations and other instances of extreme violence. The alert states: "Warning! This video contains extremely graphic content and may be upsetting." The move follows its decision to allow the clips to be posted to its site following a temporary ban on the material, introduced in May. The prime minister and Facebook's own advisors had criticised the decision. The social network said that it wished to allow its users - who can be as young as 13 - to share and condemn the material. It added that it would continue to block clips if the original poster glorified or celebrated the violence shown. On Monday the firm said it might, in time, add warnings or other controls, but initially allowed a recently uploaded decapitation clip to appear unaltered. This prompted David Cameron to tweet: "It's irresponsible of Facebook to post beheading videos, especially without a warning. They must explain their actions to worried parents." US charity the Family Online Safety Institute - a member of the social network's Safety Advisory Board - also raised concern saying it had not been alerted to the change of policy despite previously stating such videos "crossed the line". A spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment about its latest move. She had previously defended its decision to allow a video showing a woman being beheaded - believed to have been filmed in Mexico - to be shared despite the fact it bans images and videos showing a woman's "fully exposed breast". "Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences, particularly when they're connected to controversial events on the ground, such as human rights abuses, acts of terrorism and other violent events," she said. "People are sharing this video on Facebook to condemn it. If the video were being celebrated, or the actions in it encouraged, our approach would be different." A UK member of Facebook's Safety Advisory Board said he still had concerns despite the addition of the warnings. "It's a step forward but it's still horrific content," said Will Gardner, chief executive of Childnet. He added that he needed to look into the changes before commenting further. Until Monday Facebook had also featured adverts alongside the video of the Mexican murder despite the fact several users had complained to it about the material. Car-sharing firm Zipcar, whose service was one of those shown, said it was disappointed by the discovery. "We want you to know that we do not condone this type of abhorrent content being circulated on Facebook," it said in a statement. "We have expressed to Facebook in the past the critical need to block offensive content from appearing and we will continue to engage with them on this important matter." Facebook has since disabled Zipcar and other firms' ads from appearing on the page in question. One of the Facebook accounts that had requested the death video be removed belongs to the South Australia Police force (Sapol). It said it had been contacted by a member of its local community about the matter. Shelaye Boothey, director of Sapol's media and public engagement section, told the BBC: "Ultimately this is a decision that Facebook is entitled to make, however anyone concerned with the publishing of the video should continue to express their concerns through the appropriate Facebook channels." Hostage UK - a charity that supports kidnap victims and their families - added that it was also urging Facebook to reconsider its decision. "We know first-hand the acute distress these videos and images cause and we stress that this continues to be a source of worry to the families of today's hostages," it said. "We can see no useful purpose being served by the decision to make such recordings available. The public are well aware of the brutalities committed and a public showing of such material adds nothing, other than cause further unimaginable suffering." However, some freedom of speech campaigners believe that Facebook should not block the videos, even if they do celebrate the violence contained. French digital rights group La Quadrature Du Net described the actions as "privatised censorship". "It plays a profoundly anti-democratic role when it makes any such choice, whatever the limits are and whatever the good reasons it uses to make the decision," said the organisation's co-founder Jeremie Zimmermann. </body>

      <title>UK aims to claw back EU welfare cash</title>
      <description>The UK is examining ways to claim back cash for welfare payments made to migrants from other EU countries, the BBC understands.</description>

      <body>The UK is examining ways to claw back welfare payments made to migrants from other EU countries from their home government, the BBC understands. A levy could be put in place so that for the first two years that a migrant was in the UK, the government would be able to reclaim any benefits paid out. The arrangement was used until the 1990s, when the EU had fewer members. A Foreign Office source said officials were checking if it was "possible to return to the system". People coming to the UK from the European Economic Area - the EU member states and Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway - do not have unrestricted access to social security benefits and tax credits. Most have to pass the habitual residence test before they can claim. To do so, they must have a "right to reside" in the UK, which means you are economically active, or are able to support yourself, and you must be intending to settle for the time being - to be "habitually resident". Those who pass the test can claim housing benefit, council tax benefit, access to local authority housing, income support, Jobseeker's Allowance and Employment and Support Allowance. Re-introducing a system of national refunds for benefits claims "might not raise huge sums," the senior Foreign Office source said, "but it would send a clear message about who is picking up the bill for these people". It is understood Whitehall officials acknowledge that reverting to an approach previously used two decades ago may no longer be practical given EU expansion and changes to European law since then, but it is regarded as worth exploring. In January 2014, restrictions that have applied to migrants from Romania and Bulgaria to the UK will expire. Meanwhile, the UK is being taken to court by the European Commission for allegedly discriminating against EU nationals who claim social security in the UK. It is alleged the extra UK "right to reside" test to see if migrants are eligible to claim breaches EU law. The government has said it will fight the court case robustly. Ministers are keen to be seen to be adopting a muscular approach to immigration, given how big a priority opinion polls suggest it is to many voters, and the recent strong performances of the UK Independence Party. </body>

      <title>Antique guns 'adapted' by criminals</title>
      <description>Obsolete guns being adapted by gangs facing weapons shortage</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24626158</url>

      <body>Antiques and obsolete guns are being adapted and used by criminals facing a shortage of weapons, according to police. A decade ago, Britain's cities were experiencing a surge in gun crime but, following successful interventions by crime agencies and the government, the number of firearms offences annually is now half what it was in 2003, according to the Office for National Statistics. One reason is the supply of weapons has been severely restricted, forcing criminals to seek out other means of sourcing guns. The National Ballistics Intelligence Service (NABIS), established in 2008, helps police forces solve crimes in which guns have been used, identify individuals who import and supply them illegally, and track down people who are illegally converting or adapting them. On the firing range at its base in a Birmingham suburb, ballistics expert Greg Taylor shoots several rounds from a Russian-made Baikal pistol. Built to fire CS gas canisters, they were easily adapted to fire live 9mm ammunition. There was a period, a few years ago, where this was the go-to gun of choice for criminal gangs in the UK, but as a result of international co-operation between British and Russian authorities and those in the Baltic states, the supply has dried up. But other weapons have taken its place. In the laboratory next door cupboards are filled with evidence from active firearms investigations by the 28 police forces in England and Wales which NABIS serves. On the desks are microscopes used by the ballistics experts to match bullets to weapons and in the armoury is a collection of hundreds of different weapons, kept in store in order to be used to provide matches to crime scenes. Many were brought here rather than destroyed after successful prosecutions in the courts. One is the Hungarian Feg pistol which was used during an incident where West Midlands Police officers were attacked during the riots in 2011. They came under fire from gang members outside the Barton Arms pub in Aston. As a result, 10 people were jailed, including Beniha Laing and Wesley Gray, who were sentenced to 35 and 29 years respectively. Another weapon seized after that attack was a French-made Saint-Etienne army revolver, used by the French Army in the 1870s. Like many weapons of that era, spanning from the American Civil War until WWI, they can be legally imported as antiques. Though they were built to fire ammunition that is now obsolete, they can be adapted to fire modern bullets. "You can buy a weapon like that because it's of obsolete calibre, there's no licence required, and criminals are converting or modifying ammunition to fit," said Mr Taylor. As we are discussing the problem, a new addition to the collection is brought in - a single shot Derringer-style pistol, which might have been carried by ladies in the late 19th Century for personal protection. It is thought that a number of burglaries at antiques weapons collectors' homes across the country may have been ordered by gangs who are desperate to source new guns and rifles. There are stringent penalties for possessing a firearm, including imprisonment. However, NABIS say there are now "armourers", who illegally provide guns for hire to gangs because of the shortage of supply. In some cases, the same gun might have been used a number of times by different gangs in different cities. "In the UK, getting your hands on a weapon is probably not as free and easy as it is in some countries," said Det Supt Iain O'Brien. "So you have a situation where weapons can be used by different sides of a dispute." The next potential threat in this country is the introduction of a gun which can be made using a 3D printer. It would not need to be imported. When the ballistics expert tested one on the range, using a remote firing device and behind the safety of a bulletproof screen, it blew up. It would probably have caused more damage to the person firing it than the one being fired at. However, as crude as early versions are, they could become more sophisticated. </body>

      <body>The Scottish government is looking to find a buyer for the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemicals plant. The current owner, Ineos, has said the plant will close without new investment and changes to workers' terms and conditions. Finding a buyer for the plant will be a challenge as there is an excess of refining capacity in Europe, meaning profit margins are low. So what would be the impact of the the closure of Grangemouth? Grangemouth refines 80% of the fuel used in Scotland and it also supplies Northern Ireland and the North of England. Contingency plans are being made to replace petrol and diesel supplies if the refinery closes and experts say that fuel could be sourced from elsewhere. "With petrol and diesel supplies, unless there is panic buying, there should not be a problem as there are plenty of imports," says Alexander Kemp, Professor of Petroleum Economics, at the University of Aberdeen. The number of refineries in the UK has been falling for decades and at the moment there are seven. Coryton in Essex was the most recent to close after its owner Petroplus, filed for bankruptcy in 2012. But analysts say there is still overcapacity in Western Europe and the situation has been made worse recently by cheap fuel imports from the United States. US refineries pay around $15 a barrel less than UK refineries for crude oil, which has helped US firms to export cheap fuel to the UK. But Professor Kemp says there is a longer term issue of energy security for the UK as "we can't always rely on cheap imports of fuel". At the moment the UK imports 47% of the diesel and 50% of the aviation fuel it needs. But for petrol there is currently a 20% oversupply, according to figures from the research group, IHS Purvin and Getz. Its research shows that if two refineries were to close down, the UK would rely on imports for more than 70% of its diesel and jet fuel and more than 20% of its petrol. The Grangemouth refinery has an annual turnover of billions of pounds a year and has 1,370 staff. It also employs another 2,000 contractors and the refinery's owner, Ineos, estimates that 10,000 jobs indirectly rely on the facility. Due to the refinery and the associated chemicals business, the Falkirk area employs more people in manufacturing than the rest of Scotland combined. "It's actually a fundamental part of the infrastructure of the chemical, petrochemical and plastics industries of the UK and it would be madness to have it shut down," said the local Labour MP, Michael Connarty. But Ineos says the refinery is losing £10m a month and needs an investment of £300m. The Forties pipeline delivers a third of the UK's oil output. The steam and power which runs the pipeline and BP's Kinneil terminal comes from Grangemouth. At the moment the supply of steam and power has not been interrupted and Ineos and union workers have been keen to maintain supplies. But if Grangemouth is forced to close then it is not clear what happens next. A strike at Grangemouth in 2008 shut the Kinneil terminal and that forced 70 North Sea oil platforms to shut down or reduce production. PetroChina owns half the refinery which is operated by Ineos. It can process 210,000 barrels of crude daily. Ineos also owns the petrochemical plant which is attached to the refinery. Analysts say the petrochemicals plant would struggle to run profitably without the refinery. </body>

      <description>Sir Alex Ferguson on Beckham, Keane and Ronaldo</description>

      <body>Sir Alex Ferguson's eagerly anticipated autobiography provides unprecedented insight into one of football's most successful and iconic managers. The 71-year-old retired last summer after 26 years as manager of Manchester United, having guided the club to 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, four League Cups and two Champions League crowns. In 'Alex Ferguson: My Autobiography', released on Thursday, the Scot, who was succeeded by David Moyes, addresses a number of subjects. Ferguson's falling-out with David Beckham followed United's FA Cup fifth-round defeat to Arsenal in 2003. The United boss was critical of the midfielder's performance - but Beckham did not react well to being singled out. "As usual, with David at that time, he was dismissive of my criticism," wrote Ferguson. "He was around 12 feet from me. David swore. I moved towards him, and as I approached I kicked a boot. It hit him right above the eye. He rose to have a go at me and the players stopped him. 'Sit down,' I said. 'You've let your team down. You can argue as much as you like.' "I called him in the next day to go through the video and he still would not accept his mistake. "The next day, the story was in the press. It was in those days that I told the board David had to go." Ferguson says Ronaldo was the "most gifted player" he managed, adding: "He surpassed all the other great ones I coached at United." The winger spent six years at Old Trafford before he moved to Real Madrid in 2009 for a world-record £80m transfer fee. He might have moved to Real a year earlier, but Ferguson had been unhappy with the Spanish club's public courting of the player, who had joined United from Sporting Lisbon in a £12m deal in 2003. The Scot was so irate with Real president Ramon Calderon that he told Ronaldo he would rather "shoot" him than "sell" him to Real at that stage, before promising the player he could leave Old Trafford the following summer if the right deal came along. Ferguson had several run-ins with Rafael Benitez while the Spaniard was manager of Liverpool. In his book, Ferguson explained that the chief reason for the fall-out was because Benitez chose to "turn our rivalry personal". Ferguson said: "Once you made it personal, you had no chance. Benitez was striving for trophies while also taking me on. That was unwise." Ferguson is a big admirer of Rooney's natural ability but had concerns about his fitness, particularly during his last season in charge. "I felt he was struggling to get by people and had lost some of his old thrust," wrote Ferguson, who signed Rooney from Everton in 2004. "As time wore on, I felt he struggled more and more to do it for 90 minutes." Finally, Ferguson added that Rooney came to see him after United had won the Premier League title last season and asked to leave the club. Ferguson explained: "I left him to discuss his future with David Moyes, hoping to see many more great performances from him at Old Trafford." Perhaps the biggest criticism in Ferguson's book is reserved for former United midfielder Roy Keane. Ferguson wrote the following: "The hardest part of Roy's body is his tongue. He has the most savage tongue you can imagine. "He can debilitate the most confident person in the world in seconds. He was an intimidating, ferocious individual." </body>

      <body>To fans of motor racing the banked section of crumbling road in the above picture is instantly recognisable as the home of British motorsport, Brooklands. This was the site of the first purpose-built motor racing circuit anywhere in the world, and one that in its heyday in the 1920s and '30s saw thousands of fans lining the track, hoping to catch a glimpse of those pioneering racers. The course was built in 1907 with sections of concrete banking to allow the cars to reach higher speeds than would otherwise have been possible. The design ensured it was the site of a number of land speed records and was home to the first British Grand Prix in 1927. Alongside its motoring heritage it was also home to aviation pioneers, and by the start of World War II the site was given over to use by Vickers-Armstrongs and Hawker aircraft companies. Sadly, motor racing never returned to the site, though TV presenter James May did attempt to build the biggest Scalextric track along the route. Photographer Douglas Kurn lives locally and decided to undertake the task of documenting the remains of the Brooklands circuit. To contrast with the noise and speed of a race day, Douglas chose to shoot the project at night to give a peaceful, surreal feel to the images. Some of the exposures ran well past the hour and in total the project has taken four years to complete. The Spirit of Brooklands was chosen by the Association of Photographers for its online exhibition of members' work, and a selection of prints was recently exhibited at the Brooklands Museum in Weybridge. You can see more of Douglas Kurn's work on his website. </body>

      <body>Great British Bake Off 2013 comes to an end tonight. My editors wanted to mark the occasion. "Get Huw to make a cake," someone said. If only they'd known how much terror that apparently simple idea was to unleash. Think really good home baking and you think of the Scottish Women's Rural Institute (the equivalent of the WI, if you're south of the border). The WRI? Terrifying? Well, yes. Truly. I ended up at the Royal Deeside home of Frances Johnstone - Ballater's answer to Mary Berry. She's an award-winning baker. She's judged more cake competitions than you've had hot dinners. Prince Charles has praised her Clootie Dumpling. And she's a huge fan of the tv series. She's warm. Charming. Friendly. All of those things, combined with a steely expertise. You get the sense that she could sniff out a soggy bottom faster than Paul Hollywood. And she's not going to be impressed with an uneven bake. Or any stray bits of egg shell that make it into the cake mixture. She's got a recipe ready for me when I arrive at her house. The classic of home baking. An apparently simple Victoria Sandwich. Named, apparently, because the eponymous monarch - who often stayed up the road at her beloved Balmoral - was partial to a slice with her afternoon tea. Luckily Frances has decided we're going for the all-in-one method. Not the much more difficult traditional method, with the ever-present risk it'll curdle when you mix in the eggs. So I grease and line the tins with baking parchment. Sieve eight ounces of self-raising flour into a big brown bowl. Add eight ounces of caster sugar. Chop up eight ounces of butter. Pour in four eggs, and add two tea spoons of baking powder. I'm getting ready to mix it all together. But Frances intervenes. The recipe was written by her heroine, Mary Berry. But. Mary Berry got it ever so slightly wrong, apparently. "I always like to add a pinch of salt to all my recipes," Frances explains. And there's no mention of vanilla essence, either. But again that will make it better. So, in it goes. As I turn on the hand mixer, flour goes everywhere. Frances winces, slightly. But doesn't say anything. I'm talking too much. Interviewing Frances for a report on BBC radio's "Good Morning Scotland" programme. Trying to understand the secret of a really successful cake. So I forget to take a note of the time. The recipe says beat the mixture for two minutes. I have no idea how long I actually mixed it for. Then it's time to divide the batter between my two prepared tins. I roughly spoon the mix into two halves, and get ready to smooth it down. But Frances wants me to weigh the tins. to make sure the division is truly accurate. By pure fluke both tins weigh exactly the same. Frances beams. By mistake I've done something exactly right. Then it's into the pre-heated oven. For 25 minutes. Just time for Frances to spell out what a Victoria Sandwich should be like. "Well risen. Nice colour. Good texture. Good taste. And, obviously, very light." I giggle nervously, as the kitchen fills with the smell of cooking cakes. And peer through the glass of the oven as they seem - unbelievably - actually to be rising. They're taken out. Removed for their tins. Left to cool on wire racks. So, what does Frances think? "They're very even. Not too bad." So, not prize winners then? "It would depend what else was entered, doesn't it?" Frances laughs. Then, the crucial taste test. And again her verdict is carefully calibrated. They are, she pronounces, "very edible". Not, you'll note, very delicious. But at least very edible. So what went wrong? "I thought they might have risen a wee bit more. I wonder if you did enough beating. I'm not too sure on that." So when the time comes to serve my cake to the programme's presenters I decide to resort to a distraction technique. Slavering the whole thing with fresh whipped cream. Really good jam. And fresh raspberries. All to draw attention away from the actual sponges themselves. So, terrifying? Yes. But with a lot of laughter. And a "very edible" cake at the end of it. Next time, though, I'm going to suggest Frances does the baking. While I watch. And learn. </body>

      <title>Outfoxing the urban fox</title>
      <description>The humane way to get the better of an urban fox</description>

      <body>There are an estimated 33,000 urban foxes in the UK's towns and cities. Outwitting the wily creatures is becoming an increasingly popular way to control them humanely. There are many people who dislike urban foxes. They have been blamed for biting babies and killing penguins at London Zoo, but others feed them and treat them like pets. Foxes first colonised UK towns and cities in the 1940s and an estimated 33,000 now live in them, according to research by Bristol University. There are thought to be 16 per square mile in London alone. Dealing with urban foxes is complicated. They are protected under a series of wildlife laws and it is only permissible to control numbers in very limited ways. Even then methods such as shooting often aren't appropriate in urban areas. But there are a small number of fox experts specialising in dealing with them in ways that will not harm the animal. They call it "humane deterrence" and don't like to be labelled as pest controllers. They are getting up to 50 calls a week from people who need help but don't want the fox harmed. Killing foxes is pointless in urban areas, they argue, because another one will quickly take its place. Fox experts agree. "A fox will constantly mark its territory," says John Bryant, who is based in Tonbridge, Kent, and was one of the first people to offer humane deterrence. "The moment it stops it's obvious to others foxes that it isn't there any more and they will move in. So if you shoot a fox another will colonise the vacant territory in a matter of days." The humane approach is about disturbing a fox's normal behaviour and, crucially, moving it to another part of its territory. This means its scent will still be left around the area so no other foxes will move in. "Foxes repeat behaviour day after day but they are very smart and if an area becomes hostile they will move somewhere else," says Terry Woods, co-founder of Fox-A-Gon, which operates in London and the South East. A fox's territory can cover up to 40 acres and in urban areas can include up to 400 gardens, says Bryant. If you deter it from one garden it could have another 399 to choose from, he says. "It might only move to a garden a few doors down but that person might not think the fox is a problem. It's obviously going to return to a garden where it is welcome, not one where it isn't." Methods used are often simple. One of the most popular, and most effective, is motion-activated sprinklers that repel foxes with a short but startling burst of water. Underground cameras are also used to hunt out and block hidden routes that foxes use to get in an area. Brookside, a street in north London, typifies the divide of opinion there often is when it comes to urban foxes. One resident, Sofia, has chickens and worries they will be killed by foxes. She has used many methods to deter them, including human hair after reading on the internet that foxes don't like the smell. "It was a bit of a random request but my mum went to the hairdressers and asked for a bag of hair," she says. "I've wedged it in certain places but foxes have pulled it out. If a fox killed my chickens I'd be absolutely devastated." Nobby lives a few doors down and has been feeding local foxes for years, luring them into his garden with dog food and biscuits. "There are a lot of people round here that say 'you and your foxes are making a lot of noise and they're digging holes in my garden'. I tell them to go boil their heads." Common complaints about foxes can usually be narrowed down to mess, pungent-smelling faeces, digging holes and noise. They screech when they fight over territory or female foxes during mating season. But fox lovers point out that other animals, such as pet cats and dogs, are also responsible for such behaviour. Fox experts say there are many common myths surrounding foxes, including that they scavenge in bins every night and kill for fun. Both are untrue, they argue. Other people may beg to differ. Problems are often because of people and not foxes, say the experts. "You shouldn't encourage foxes into your home or try to tame them," says Stephen Harris, professor of environmental sciences at the University of Bristol and an expert on foxes. "They are incredibly intelligent but, just like people, they are all different. They will have different responses - some will be friendly but some won't." He says fox attacks are extremely rare but the animals do explore using their teeth and nip things to see what they are. "It's usually exploratory, inquisitive behaviour but you don't want to be on the receiving end. "Britain has some of the highest-density fox populations in the world but they cause remarkably few problems. There are many benefits of having foxes in urban areas, including being nature's pest controllers when it comes to rats and feral pigeons. "The vast majority of householders like to see the foxes in their garden. It's a bit of the countryside in town." But fox supporters do, however, recognise they can be a nuisance. Vixens give birth around March and the cubs are normally driven out to find their own territories by their parents in the late summer and autumn. "When the adolescent foxes are kicked out of home they become teenage hooligans," says Bryant. "They come down streets in gangs and cause trouble. I've known them to bite through the brake pipes on cars. It's very rare, but I have dealt with a few cases." But at the end of the day the argument for humane controls is simple, say those in the business. "We can't exist in isolation," says Woods. "Nature runs in harmony and foxes are an important part of the ecosystem. If you start taking out what you don't like - the squirrels, the foxes, the badgers - you end up with nothing."

      <description>Are people getting too snobbish about frozen food?</description>

      <body>A new series captures what life is like at frozen food retailer Iceland, but are some of us a little bit snooty in our attitude to frozen food? Google it and you'll see there have been dozens of attempts to establish whether fresh or frozen vegetables are better for you. Many cite a US Food and Drug Administration report from 1998 that established frozen was better than fresh. Advocates of frozen say the process prevents nutrient loss occurring in transport. Even those who plump for fresh admit that frozen vegetables are still a healthy option. And yet there's a marked degree of antipathy towards frozen food. "Iceland is a classic British institution that half the country loves and half the country hates. Half of the population absolutely hate it without ever having, in most cases, been in a shop or bought a product," says Keith Hann, PR consultant for Iceland Foods. "In a word, snobbery." For some, frozen food conjures up images of Mike Leigh's 1977 drama Abigail's Party, with kitsch dishes such as defrosted prawn cocktail, vol-au-vents and black forest gateau, not forgetting the staple of any 70s dinner party - the Arctic roll. Brian Young, director general of the British Frozen Food Federation (BFFF), says he senses a chill in the air when it comes to the British public's opinion of frozen food. "Pretty much every food manufacturer will do blind testing of their product and every blind test that I've known, particularly on fish and other products, will ask the consumer to compare two samples side by side and nearly always they prefer the frozen variety. "If you then show them the packaging and you show it was a frozen product or a fresh product, they then nearly always choose the fresh one, even though they have just tasted something that was significantly better." Price could be a factor, suggests Young. "[Frozen food] can be produced much more efficiently than a fresh or a chilled counterpart, so it finishes up that the price of the product is quite often significantly less. People associate the fact that if you looked at two pizzas and one was £2.50 and one was £1.50 you naturally assume the £2.50 one is better quality." Cutting down on waste in the supply chain is one of the biggest advantages of freezing, says Young. But he also claims there are health benefits. Research conducted recently by Chester University and Leatherhead Food Research - and funded by the BFFF - found in two out of three cases frozen fruit and vegetables contained more antioxidants and nutrients than fresh produce. "They are losing their vitamins, they are losing their antioxidants the minute they come out of the ground or you pick them off the plant or tree, so by freezing them you lock in that goodness for longer," says Young. However Michael Barker, editor of Fresh Produce Journal, says consumers do like the taste and that "just picked" look of fresh produce. "It's true scientifically that you do start to lose [some] nutrients as soon as the product is picked, but I don't think it's such a massive loss that you're not still getting those nutrients. It's still an incredibly healthy product to eat regardless of whether it's fresh or frozen," says Barker. He says fresh and frozen are not rivals when it comes to the food chain. "The number of fruit and vegetables, and particularly fruit, that you find frozen is relatively limited. You think about the biggest selling fruits - bananas, oranges, apples, pears - you don't really see these in frozen formats." Jamie Oliver and Delia Smith have both used frozen vegetables in recipes on their cookery programmes. But David Gray, analyst at Planet Retail, rejects the idea that frozen food has any type of image problem. "Frozen food is a lot more popular than it used to be, a lot more common," says Gray. "It is seen as good value for money by consumers." He believes the industry's reputation was knocked recently by the horse meat scandal which affected frozen meat products, but predicts frozen food sales will keep rising. He also says frozen food could expand into discount stores. Some pound stores are already starting to sell a small selection of frozen food. There has even been a resurgence in the popularity of some retro classics such as chicken Kiev - eaten by Don Draper in the 1960s inspired TV series Mad Men. As well as expanding into new areas of the high street, frozen food manufacturers and retailers are also now offering consumers new ranges at the top end of the market. For example, frozen food store Cook sells handmade food for the freezer. Beef wellingtons are priced at £20 for two portions, and on the packet you will find the name of the chef who prepared the dish before it was frozen. Food critic and regular on BBC's Masterchef Kate Spicer says there is a "revolution in home cooked food being sold on to people". She advocates schemes such as buying homemade food from a neighbour who has more time to spare to prepare meals which can then be frozen. When it comes down to it the British public are not snobbish about the method of preservation, she says. "There's frozen food and there's frozen food, and I think a lot of it has to do with the brand on the box and not the fact that it's frozen," says Spicer.

      <body>Research on the effects of so-called health tourism by overseas patients on the NHS in England is explored in Tuesday's newspapers. The Daily Mail is adamant that "Britain can't afford to treat the world" and it applauds Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt for his efforts to claw back some of the money. The Times is more cautious, noting that the Department of Health admits that the figures are "based on a large number of assumptions". In its front page coverage of the story, the Daily Telegraph focuses on the reported £2bn annual cost to the NHS for treating foreign patients. Meanwhile, the Guardian reports the claims were challenged by Labour, while doctors have raised concerns that they did not have the capacity to "act as border guards". Elsewhere, the deal for a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point and the political row about energy prices continues to generate coverage. The Daily Telegraph is concerned that British taxpayers are paying over the odds in subsidies to foreign-owned energy companies for nuclear power. But it accepts the deal with French-owned EDF to build and run the plant is a "price worth paying to keep the lights on", concluding that energy policy has been a shambles for decades. The Guardian fears the decision to subsidise state-owned Chinese and French companies shows "a huge lack of belief in UK competence". It also suggests that Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey had no choice but to go nuclear at any price because of the chancellor's resistance to spending more on other forms of renewable energy. The Times saves its ire for the energy companies whose price hikes it says have pushed family bills to unaffordable levels. The paper says the government ought to have fought harder for better terms from EDF. According to the Sun, the architects of the energy crisis are not the suppliers but "feeble and dithering politicians" . It believes the "blame falls squarely on Labour", saying it had 13 years to solve energy problems but only vaguely put its faith in wind farms and failed to sign off any new nuclear plants. The Daily Mirror has what it describes as a "white widow exclusive", carrying a front page picture it says is of terror suspect Samantha Lewthwaite cuddling her newborn baby daughter. It comes almost a month after Interpol issued a wanted persons notice for the Briton, whose husband was one of the four suicide bombers who attacked London on 7 July 2005. A new study which suggests that insomnia or restless sleep could be linked to Alzheimer's in older people is quoted in the Daily Telegraph. The Times wonders whether poor sleep could play a role in causing dementia rather than simply being a symptom, something the researchers have stopped short of demonstrating. Finally, the Daily Express says middle aged men everywhere are facing an anxious wait for what it hopes will be "hair-raising" final results of clinical trials to find a cure for baldness. It is among the papers to report that tests on mice suggest it is possible to grow new hair follicles from human skin cells, a major development from the current system of transplanting hair follicles. While the Daily Mail cautions against waiting with bated breath for a treatment that is years away, the Independent says it is a cause for celebration. The techniques used in this study give a glimpse, it believes, of the future of medicine saying "in the 21st century, it will be the turn of regenerative medicines based on cell transplants". </body>
