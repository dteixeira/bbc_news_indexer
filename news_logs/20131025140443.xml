      <body>The Grangemouth petrochemical plant near Falkirk is to stay open after a new deal was struck with workers. Staff were told in a mass meeting at 11:00 that the decision to close the site would be reversed. Operator Ineos announced on Wednesday that the plant was to shut, with the loss of 800 jobs, after union members rejected a survival plan. But on Friday, Ineos said it would reopen the plant and the neighbouring oil refinery "with immediate effect". The news was welcomed by the Unite union and political leaders. The company said the move had followed a "dramatic U-turn" by Unite and its "belated recognition" that the company's survival plan was the only way to ensure Grangemouth's long-term future. It added that Unite had agreed to taking no strike action for three years, moving to a "modern" pension scheme and accepting a three-year pay freeze. Ineos also confirmed it would invest a further £300m in the site's long-term future. The company's announcement was greeted by huge cheers from the workforce, who had gathered at the plant to be told of the company's decision. Unite Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said: "Relief will ring right round the Grangemouth community, and across Scotland today. "Hundreds of jobs that would have been lost can now be saved and £300m will be invested into the plant." First Minister Alex Salmond described the announcement as a "tremendous fillip for the workforce and the whole Grangemouth community, following what could have been a potential disaster". He said it had been "a great team effort from all concerned", including the unions and workforce, the management and governments. "I am delighted that people have rallied round to protect these jobs, and now we can all agree that Grangemouth has an outstanding future," he added. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael also welcomed the announcement, saying that it was "the news that we all wanted". "The staff and their families have been through a very stressful and uncertain time," he said. "They have been through a hell of a week and I hope they have a much better weekend as a result of today's announcement." Mr Carmichael added: "They can look to the future with an optimism which was absent earlier in the week." Ineos' future plans include investing a further £300m in the site. Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean said: "It is a huge investment and that investment was only rightly to be done if we had a long-term sustainable base. "What we have now done is given the chemicals business another 15 to 20 years on the back of new raw materials, new contracts and significant investment." Mr MacLean would not dismiss the prospect of redundancies, but said they would be "very limited". He also denied that the company had demanded any additional concessions from the union. The company said the Scottish government had indicated it would support its application for a £9m grant to help finance a gas terminal, while the UK government had given "pre-qualification approval" for a £125m loan guarantee facility. Ineos founder and chairman Jim Ratcliffe said it was "a victory for common sense". He told the BBC that the Grangemouth complex "should have a life for many years to come, as long as we can get this gas terminal built and we can sign up gas contracts and bring gas in from America". The company has indicated that 2,000 contractors it laid off after shutting down the complex would be re-hired to support investment in its survival plan. Falkirk Council, which had planned to set up a task force to respond to the threatened closure, said the Ineos announcement was "the best possible outcome for all concerned". Council leader Craig Martin added: "There has been a tremendous effort behind the scenes to secure the plant's future involving UK and Scottish governments and Falkirk Council, working together to ensure the plant's survival. "This partnership approach has paid off and a more stable and positive future for the workforce has been delivered." The closure move came after workers rejected a deal which would have changed their pay and pensions. Ministers and Unite were involved in top-level talks on Thursday to try to save the site and a fresh offer was made by unions to the company. </body>

      <title>UK growth fastest for three years</title>
      <description>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show, the fastest growth since 2010.</description>

      <body>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show. The Office for National Statistics said there had been a "fairly strong" performance across all sectors. The data builds on a 0.7% GDP rise in the April-June period and is the best quarterly performance since 2010. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne tweeted: "This shows that Britain's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity." Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the figures "show that we are firmly on the road to economic recovery". The ONS data for construction was up 2.5% over the quarter, the second successive quarter of growth after a volatile performance over the past year. The BBC's chief economics correspondent, Hugh Pym, said: "This could signal that a recovery in that sector is really under way." House-builders have been buoyed by the Government's Help to Buy scheme, which recently launched a new phase offering mortgage guarantees. The ONS said that production grew by 0.5%, though this remains 12.8% off its 2008 level, while within this, manufacturing improved 0.9% in the third quarter. The services sector, which represents three-quarters of economic output, grew by 0.7%. Output from services is now above its pre-crisis peak in the first quarter of 2008. Friday's figure is the first estimate, and could be revised up or down in subsequent months. Mr Osborne told the BBC: "It shows that we are on the path to prosperity. Lots of risks remain, so we have to stick with the economic plan that has got us this far. "What's encouraging about these figures is that it's not just services that are growing. Construction is growing and manufacturing is growing." Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: "After three damaging years of flatlining, it's both welcome and long overdue that our economy is growing again. "But for millions of people across the country still seeing prices rising faster than their wages, this is no recovery at all." Despite the further evidence that recovery is gaining hold, some economists remain cautious. The Institute of Directors' chief economist Graeme Leach said: "The outlook looks better than at any time since the onset of the financial crisis. Indeed, our members have more confidence in the economy than at any time since 2008. "However, strong headwinds remain and the annual growth rate year on year is nothing to get too excited about yet. Though inflationary pressures are likely to remain benign, debt and inflation are rising faster than earnings. "By far the biggest challenges remain on the supply side, not the demand side. Supply side constraints mean that the current growth spurt is unlikely to extend beyond next year. "This stage of our economic recovery is likely to be short and sweet, instead of long and strong." The director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, John Longworth, said: "This is the highest quarterly increase we've seen in three years, so the economy is clearly moving in the right direction. "But we are still behind a number of advanced economies, such as the US and Germany, that have managed to recover the output lost during the economic downturn. "Much more needs to be done to transform our economy from being good to being really great." Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said the figures confirmed the UK was enjoying "a period of healthy and well-balanced growth". He said it was likely that the UK recorded the fastest quarterly growth rate within the G7 countries in the third quarter. But he added that a squeeze on real incomes as wage growth lagged behind inflation, together with the fiscal squeeze and a stagnant eurozone, were likely to prevent recovery gathering much more pace. It echoed remarks by Bank of England governor Mark Carney on Thursday evening, when he said in a speech that the rate of growth was "towards the top end of the advanced economies", but "coming from a very very low base". </body>

      <title>Serco chief executive stands down</title>
      <description>The boss of security firm Serco resigns after accusations of overcharging the government tens of millions of pounds for electronic tags for criminals.</description>

      <body>The chief executive at Serco, a security firm at the centre of an overcharging scandal, has resigned. Outgoing boss Chris Hyman said the best way for the company to move forward "is for me to step back". Serco is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) after claims it had overcharged the government by "tens of millions" of pounds for electronic tags for criminals. The government welcomed the news, describing it as a "positive move". In July, Justice Secretary Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said an audit had revealed a "significant anomaly in the billing practices" of both Serco and G4S. Mr Grayling said that since 2005, the companies had in some cases been charging for tagging offenders who were in prison, had left the country or were even dead. In September, the government handed information to the SFO for their assessment. On Friday, Serco announced plans to reorganise the company. The firm said it would split the government work into a separate business that could be more closely monitored. A government statement said it would "take full account of all the changes Serco have made today". "Whilst it is early days in their programme of renewal, this is a positive move by Serco and a step forward." The statement added that its review of government contracts, announced in July by the Justice Secretary, was continuing and would "ensure government's contractual arrangements are robust and taxpayers' money is spent responsibly, in a vibrant, competitive market for public services". Shares in Serco were up 2.8% after the news. Mr Hyman said he had "always put the interests of Serco first", adding that it was important the relationship with the government was rebuilt. He said: "I have been fortunate enough to have had the privilege of working at a great company with extremely talented people. I wish everyone at Serco the very best for the future." No new contracts are being awarded to either of the firms until the audit is completed, the government said in September. The head of G4S, Richard Morris, stepped down on Thursday. </body>

      <body>A second letter bomb addressed to a serving senior police officer has been discovered at a mail sorting office in Northern Ireland. The package was found at a Royal Mail depot in Lisburn, County Antrim. It comes hours after a device in a package addressed to the PSNI chief constable was intercepted at a sorting office in north Belfast. Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr said it was thought that dissident republicans were behind both incidents. He also blamed dissidents for pipe bomb attacks on police vehicles in Londonderry and the outskirts of Belfast over the last three days. "All four, along with other attacks this months, have been designed to kill police officers," he told a press conference on Friday. "We are very lucky we are not dealing with a fatality this morning." An Army bomb team dealt with the device at Mallusk, north Belfast, early on Friday. It had been addressed to Matt Baggott at police headquarters in Knock, east Belfast. Later, a delivery office at Linenhall Street, Lisburn, was evacuated following the discovery of a suspicious object. The police said that both packages contained a viable device. Justice Minister David Ford said of the first device: "Those who sent this device have no concern whatsoever for the staff at the Mallusk sorting office, whose vigilance is to be commended." Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said the Mallusk attack was "callous and reckless". "Those responsible for this device have almost no support and have demonstrated a blatant disregard for the safety of those who could have been injured," she said. "The chief constable undertakes a challenging role in delivering community policing in a difficult environment." A spokeswoman for Royal Mail said: "The Northern Ireland mail centre at Mallusk was evacuated overnight due to a suspect package. "Unfortunately there will be an effect on deliveries today and we apologise for any inconvenience this may cause." Police have appealed for the public to be vigilant and report anything that looks suspicious. </body>

      <title>Firefighters to stage more strikes</title>
      <description>Firefighters in England and Wales are to strike on 1 and 4 November in a row over pensions, the Fire Brigades Union says.</description>

      <body>Firefighters in England and Wales are to stage two more strikes in the run-up to bonfire night in a row over pensions, the Fire Brigades Union says. The government wants firefighters to work up to 60 but the union says this is too old to be fighting fires. FBU members are due to walk out on 1 November from 18:30 to 23:00 GMT and on 4 November from 06:00 to 08:00 GMT. In the first round of action last month, 32,000 union members in England and Wales walked out, the FBU said. A second strike was called off earlier this month after progress was made during talks. The FBU postponed the five-hour strike saying that the government and fire employers had shifted their position and recognised that firefighters faced losing their jobs and a "large chunk" of their pensions under new changes imposed in April. However, the FBU now says the government and fire employers have failed to offer any firm guarantees on jobs or pensions. FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said: "The Westminster government has created this mess, but it is refusing to clear it up. "It now recognises the problem but it won't provide the legal and financial guarantees firefighters need to ensure they have a job and an unreduced pension in the future. "Firefighters face the sack towards the end of their career and the loss of their pension. That can't be right. "The employers promised to tackle the issue of firefighters facing the sack for failing fitness tests last week, only to say they can't offer any guarantees this week. "That is simply not the way to run a public service. "The government is now making threats to withdraw some of the other concessions they have made this year." London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson said it was prepared to deal with further strikes and would have 27 fire engines based at strategic points across the capital. "The evening strike date falls on the Friday before bonfire night. It is just before Diwali and coincides with half-term, so people need to be really careful with fireworks and bonfires," he said. During the first strike on 25 September, contingency plans at the 46 fire services in England and three in Wales included using part-time and volunteer firefighters, calling in non-union fire crews and bringing in private contractors. The armed forces had a back-up role and in the event of a major incident, union members could have returned to work. No major incidents were reported during the four-hour strike which was the first national walkout for a decade. </body>

      <title>US spying 'may harm terror fight'</title>
      <description>EU leaders meeting in Brussels say distrust of the US over spying could harm intelligence-gathering in the fight against terrorism.</description>

      <body>EU leaders meeting in Brussels say distrust of the US over spying could harm the fight against terrorism. A statement agreed by the leaders says that "a lack of trust could prejudice" intelligence-gathering co-operation. France and Germany are pushing for talks with the US to find a new "understanding" by the year's end. A number of allegations against US intelligence agents have surfaced this week, including the bugging of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone. In addition there have been claims that the US National Security Agency (NSA) monitored millions of French telephone calls. On Thursday, the UK's Guardian newspaper also reported that it had obtained a confidential memo from the NSA suggesting it had monitored the phones of 35 world leaders. The latest revelations have been sourced to US whistleblower Edward Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who fled the country earlier this year and is now in Russia. They have overshadowed other issues at the EU summit in Brussels, including the Mediterranean migration problem, which frames the agenda of Friday's talks. Italian authorities said they had intercepted some 800 migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean as the EU leaders prepared to meet. The statement of heads of state or government, released on Friday, reflects the EU leaders' conclusions following their talks on Thursday. It says the recent intelligence issues had raised "deep concerns" among European citizens. The statement says the leaders "underlined the close relationship between Europe and the USA and the value of that partnership". It continues: "[The leaders] stressed that intelligence-gathering is a vital element in the fight against terrorism." And it went on: "A lack of trust could prejudice the necessary cooperation in the field of intelligence-gathering." Belgian Prime Minister Elio di Rupo said: "The objective must remain the same - to fight against terrorism but also respect privacy. "Everyone can understand the need for exceptional measures given the danger of terrorism... but we are not in the position where we should spy on each other." Talks among the EU leaders had continued late into Thursday night. Speaking afterwards, Mrs Merkel said: "We need trust among allies and partners. Such trust now has to be built anew. "The United States of America and Europe face common challenges. We are allies. But such an alliance can only be built on trust. That's why I repeat again: spying among friends, that cannot be." Germany and France said they were proposing talks with the US to settle the row by the end of the year. The leaders' statement said: "The heads of state or government took note of the intention of France and Germany to seek bilateral talks with the USA with the aim of finding before the end of the year an understanding on mutual relations in that field. "They noted that other EU countries are welcome to join this initiative." French President Francois Hollande said on Friday; "What is at stake is preserving our relations with the United States." BBC Europe editor Gavin Hewitt says the French and Germans are looking for a new set of rules with a "no spying pact" at the core. He says this would mirror an arrangement the United States has had with Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada since just after World War II. That secret intelligence-sharing operation is known as Five Eyes. EU President Herman Van Rompuy accepted the UK had "a special relationship" with the US, but said Britain was "completely on board with this text". UK PM David Cameron has yet to comment. But a number of other leaders have indicated their support for the French and German position. Finnish PM Jyrki Katainen said: "We have to talk together with the Americans, and try to find some sort of code of conduct [on] how to cooperate on this kind of issue in the future." Swedish PM Fredrik Reinfeldt said it was "completely unacceptable" to eavesdrop on the leader of an ally, a view echoed by Italian PM Enrico Letta, who added: "We want the truth." But the BBC's Chris Morris in Brussels says that, despite the widespread anger about American spying, Mrs Merkel opposed a suggestion to suspend trade talks with the United States - and on that point, the UK will be relieved. Other leaders signalled the need to move on. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said: "The main thing is that we look to the future. The trans-Atlantic partnership was, and is, important." Mrs Merkel had raised her concerns with US President Barack Obama in a call on Wednesday. White House spokesman Jay Carney later said Mr Obama had assured Mrs Merkel that her phone was not being listened to now and would not be in the future. However, his statement left open the question of whether calls had been listened to in the past. </body>

      <title>Prince Charles 'prison' claim denied</title>
      <description>Clarence House denies reports that the Prince of Wales believes becoming king will be a form of prison.</description>

      <body>Clarence House has denied reports that the Prince of Wales believes becoming king will be a form of prison. A report in Time magazine quoted an unnamed official saying how Prince Charles is worried he will not achieve ambitions linked to his interests before "the prison shades" close. Time spoke to 50 of the prince's friends and associates for the article. It is not known whether the widely-reported comment was made by a current or former member of royal staff. A Clarence House spokesman said: "This is not the Prince of Wales's view and should not be attributed to him as he did not say these words. "The prince has dutifully supported the Queen all his life and his official duties and charitable work have always run in parallel." Catherine Mayer, who wrote the article for Time magazine, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that "part of a quote" had been "taken out of context" by other news organisations. "The thing that I find funny about that is, of course, one of the reasons I wanted to profile the prince is that I thought there was an extraordinary gap between who he was and what he did and how he was portrayed... in the British press. "So, to see some of what I hoped was sort of balanced and carefully calibrated somewhat sexed up doesn't surprise me at all." She said the term "prison shades" referred to concern among the prince's household that now the prince was taking on more of the Queen's duties "there's a big impact on what the Prince of Wales actually does already, in terms of time, so the reference was to his dwindling lack of time". She added: "He is absolutely not saying he doesn't want to be king and nobody in his household is saying that." For decades, as heir to the throne, the Prince of Wales has founded charities and spoken out on many issues. In the coming years, he will have to do more of his mother's work as she, now 87, does less. Next month, he will represent the Queen at a Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Sri Lanka. The Time profile said the prince took on extra royal duties "joylessly" and, far from "itching to assume the crown", he was already feeling its weight and worrying about its impact on his current role. Prince Charles, who does not comment on his accession, was quoted as saying he had always had this "extraordinary feeling" of "wanting to heal and make things better". Ms Mayer told Today that "the public image of him as a man who has sat there sort of cantankerously waiting for his mother to pop off so he can become king is about as far from the truth as it's possible to imagine". In the article, Ms Mayer said the prince sat down with the magazine "to discuss his hopes - and profound concerns - for the future". The interview was published as official photographs for the christening of Prince George were released. They showed the Queen with three future kings - the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge, and Prince George. It was the first such image since the christening of the future Edward VIII in 1894, with his father George V, grandfather Edward VII and great-grandmother Queen Victoria. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall will tour India before the Commonwealth summit. Commonwealth leaders meet every two years and the Queen has attended every one since 1973. </body>

      <body>Police hunting the murderer of a Muslim grandfather spent 10 weeks on a "wild goose chase" investigating whether his own son killed him, his family say. White supremacist Pavlo Lapshyn is to be sentenced later for killing Mohammed Saleem and planting bombs near three West Midlands mosques. Police initially focused their inquiry on his son after another man, Jafran Jamil, made a malicious statement. One of Mr Saleem's daughters said she believed the force became "blinkered". Mr Saleem's son, whose name has not been divulged, was never arrested but was questioned extensively by police, his family said. The grandfather of 22 had seven children - five daughters and two sons. The 82-year-old was stabbed to death in April. West Midlands Police said they spent more than 10 weeks following this line of inquiry but pursued other leads after inconsistencies were found in the statement made by Jamil. Jamil, of Victoria Street, Bordesley Green, Birmingham, was jailed on 12 September for three-and-a-half years after admitting perverting the course of justice. Mr Saleem's daughter, Shazia Khan, said she did not know Jamil and did not know why he made the false claims. "The witness told police my dad was with someone who was a member of the family at the time he was murdered," said Mrs Khan, a 45-year-old teacher from Harrow in north-west London. "After that they were blinkered in their vision. They refused to keep an open mind. They wasted time on a wild goose chase and would not listen to what we had to say. "We could have got him [Lapshyn] a lot quicker if they had been focused." Det Supt Mark Payne, of West Midlands Police, said: "With any large-scale investigation such as a murder, people known to a victim are always subject to questioning during an inquiry. "This obviously can include a victim's family. This is just one element of an investigation and is carried out as sensitively as possible." Lapshyn is being sentenced at the Old Bailey on Friday after admitting Mr Saleem's murder and plotting to cause explosions near mosques in Walsall, Tipton and Wolverhampton, in June and July. </body>

      <title>Campaigners press PM over cold homes</title>
      <description>Campaigners write to David Cameron demanding action on the "national crisis" of cold homes, as people are advised to keep houses well heated.</description>

      <body>Fuel poverty campaigners have written to Prime Minister David Cameron demanding cross-party action on the "national crisis" of cold homes. Campaigners said the UK was second only to Estonia for people struggling to pay their energy bills across Europe. It came as Public Health England urged people to keep their homes well heated this winter to avoid potentially fatal health problems. It said living rooms should be 21C (70F) and other home areas 18C (65F). Campaign group Energy Bill Revolution - an alliance of charities including Age UK and Barnardos - said the biggest problem in the UK was "leaky homes" and called for investment in a domestic insulation programme. Energy Bill Revolution said "woeful" levels of insulation had left Britain falling way behind comparable European countries such as Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands. Campaign director Ed Matthew said: "Our political leaders are falling over themselves to come up with headline-grabbing ways to cut energy bills yet they fall woefully short of a true solution to the energy bill crisis. "By far the biggest opportunity to cut energy bills is to fully insulate the UK's leaky homes. No other investment can do so much for so many. If the government is serious about solving this crisis they must make insulating homes the UK's number one infrastructure priority." Public Health England's advice came in its Cold Weather Plan for 2013, after four of the big six energy companies announced price rises. Age UK said older people in particular were increasingly anxious about the cost of heating their homes. Winter health risks range from flu to falls - but the cold can also make heart and respiratory problems much worse. On average there are about 24,000 excess winter deaths in England each year, many of which experts say are preventable. The plan has been produced in collaboration with the Department of Health, NHS England and the Local Government Association. It contains advice for the NHS and local government, as well as individuals. This includes having your flu vaccination if you are in an at-risk group, ensuring homes are properly insulated and making sure heating systems are routinely checked. From November, the Met Office will issue cold weather alerts if the temperature dips to 2C (35F) or less, or if there is severe winter weather such as heavy snow or widespread ice. Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection and medical director at Public Health England, said: "In colder weather, keeping yourself warm is essential to staying healthy, especially for the very young, older people or those with a chronic condition such as heart disease and asthma." Public health minister Jane Ellison said: "The elderly and those with long-term illnesses are particularly at risk during winter months so it's crucial that people stay warm." Age UK's charity director Caroline Abrahams said: "Being cold is a huge health risk for older people so it is absolutely essential that older people stay warm during the winter months. "But with fuel poverty blighting the lives of millions of households in the UK many older people are feeling increasingly anxious about the rising cost of energy. "The government must show it has a clear long-term plan to make low income homes more energy efficient." Labour's shadow energy and climate change minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: "People are being left in real hardship because David Cameron won't stand up to the energy companies. "Britain's energy is market is not working for families and business." </body>

      <description>A Royal Navy officer who was skippering a racing yacht that hit an oil tanker in the Solent is found guilty of contravening maritime regulations.</description>

      <body>A Royal Navy officer who was skippering a racing yacht that hit an oil tanker in the Solent has been found guilty of contravening maritime regulations. The Atalanta of Chester, belonging to Lt Roland Wilson, of Stanley, Perthshire, collided with the 260m-long Hanne Knutsen during Cowes Week 2011. The 32-year-old was convicted at Southampton Magistrates' Court of impeding the passage of a vessel. He was also found guilty of failing to keep a proper lookout. Mr Wilson, who was a serving Royal Navy officer at the time but is now a lieutenant in the reserves, had seen the tanker from five miles (8km) away, the court heard. It had been making its way to Fawley oil refinery. Wilson had told the court the ship had signalled to turn but never did, describing its manoeuvre as "unexpected". District Judge Anthony Callaway said he took the wrong decision in continuing towards the path of the tanker and not taking evasive action. The moment of impact was filmed and the video posted on YouTube, where it was watched more than 924,000 times. Mr Callaway said: "Fortuitous it was that there was no loss of life. The potential for even greater and tragic consequence is, in my judgement, apparent. "This was a serious yacht crewed by serious people in a regatta for a serious purpose. It was well equipped in terms of experience and ability to deal with any situation. "This was not some Saturday afternoon jaunt by some inadequate vessel crewed by inexperienced, clueless and foolhardy people who frankly have no business being on the water at all. "The yacht took a decision, and as I find the wrong decision, to sail towards the problem into the path of the tanker across a narrow channel. It should have kept clear and in the worst event used her engine." The judge said conditions in the Solent were crowded due to Cowes Week but the yacht's crew were experienced enough to perform the "difficult manoeuvre". He added: "The fact it didn't do so was the product not of a lack of skill, but the product of the wrong decision at the wrong time, for which the skipper, Roland Wilson, must take responsibility." Mr Wilson was ordered to pay a fine of £3,000, and costs of more than £100,000. The yacht, which had a crew of eight, suffered a damaged mast and its sail almost became entangled in the anchor of the Hanne Knutsen. One crew member suffered minor head injuries and another abandoned ship after the collision with the 120,000-tonne tanker. Mr Wilson was convicted of one count of failing to keep a proper lookout and two counts of impeding the passage of a tanker in a restricted channel. </body>

      <body>Singer Manolo Escobar, whose best-selling track Y Viva Espana became part of Spain's cultural identity in the 1970s, has died aged 82. Escobar died at home in the town of Benidorm surrounded by his family, after a long fight against cancer. He was "a symbol who lived in the musical landscape of Spaniards for half a century," Spain's culture minister, Jose Ignacio Wert, said in a statement. "Music is my life," Escobar said this month. "I will never surrender." "I am happy because I have work and because, moreover, people are still prepared to pay to see me on stage," the singer said in an interview with Spanish newspaper ABC. "I want to return to a few of the places I have been to in my career of more than 50 years and say goodbye for good. I will sing one more time in each one so that I don't go back," he added. Born in a small village outside Almeria in October 1931, Escobar had a huge following in Spain in the 1960s and 1970s with hits such as El Porompompero and Mi Carro. A well-known personality thanks to his television show Canta Manolo Escobar, he also starred in films including The Guerrillas and Father Manolo, in which he played a singing priest. But it was the success of Y Viva Espana, in 1973, that made him an international star. The track was based on Eviva Espana, the 1971 song written by Belgian duo Leo Rozenstraten and Leo Caerts, and performed, in Dutch, by Samantha. Escobar's best-selling single - released to coincide with Spain's transition from dictatorship to democracy and a boom in international tourism - sold an estimated six million copies. In 1974, the track was covered by Swedish singer Sylvia Vrethammar, whose English version reached number four in the UK Singles Chart. One of Escobar's last big acts was in July 2010 when he sang with the Spanish football team to celebrate their victory in the World Cup in South Africa. He announced his retirement from music at the end of 2012 after 50 years on the stage. Last month, he had to cancel the final dates of his farewell tour after falling ill. He was undergoing treatment, reportedly for colon cancer, at Benidorm's Hospital Clinica, but is understood to have left on Tuesday. He died at home two days later. Escobar leaves a wife, Anita, and one daughter, Vanessa. </body>

      <body>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Live!, a touring stage show based on Douglas Adams cult book, has been cancelled due to poor ticket sales. The Radio Theatre Company, which produced the show, said it regretted the cancellation, which was announced ahead of a performance in Crawley. "In the last 24 hours we have had no option but make the extremely hard and painful decision to stop the tour." All remaining dates in October and November tour have been pulled. Ticket holders have been advised to contact the venue for refunds. "Although a well-loved show, Hitchhiker's Live has been subject to the same extreme economic pressures as many productions touring the UK this autumn," producers said, in a statement posted on its website. "Ticket sales across the board have been lower than average and we have not escaped this trend. "A difficult financial environment for such a large and technical show means that covering operating costs has become impossible." "We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this may cause and share the extreme disappointment and frustration felt by many who were looking forward to seeing the show. We sincerely hope that it can be brought back in the future." 'Devastated' In a joint statement with director Dirk Maggs, Simon Jones, who played Arthur Dent in the show, wrote on his Facebook page: "With infinite regret, despite happy audiences and 5 star reviews, we have been forced to curtail this tour ahead of schedule due to economic adversity. " "Having worked so hard to put on a show worthy of Douglas Adams and his devoted fans, we are utterly devastated. "It has been a pleasure to be a part of a company, band and crew who have become a close knit family. We know people hoping to see the show will be as horribly disappointed as we are, and offer our heartfelt apologies for any inconvenience this has caused. The show, which kicked off its UK tour in 2012, reunited members of the original radio and TV cast including Mark Wing-Davey and Geoff McGivern. The voice of the book was played by a series of guest performers including Hugh Dennis and Anita Dobson. </body>

      <body>Supermarket chain Sainsbury's has apologised after a worker told a new mother she "shouldn't be out of the house with a baby this young". Sabina Latto said she was approached by the female employee in a store in Hedge End, Hampshire, with questions about her six-week-old son, Myles. But the conversation turned and she was later asked: "Where's the father?" She complained while in the store and the worker apologised. Sainsbury's said it was investigating. Mrs Latto said it was one of the few times she had taken Myles out of the house since he was born. "I was approached by a member of staff, and when you have a new baby lots of people approach you and usually it's very kind things like 'oh isn't he gorgeous', and initially that's how the conversation started," she told BBC News. "Unfortunately it took a very sudden turn when she decided to tell me that, basically, I shouldn't be out of the house with a baby this young. "She asked me what I was thinking 'bringing my son to a place like this'. "It left me completely shocked, I was almost speechless." The new mother said other shoppers stepped in to defend her but the remarks continued during the incident on Wednesday. "Then she went on to ask me where my son's father was," Mrs Latto added. "[It] made it seem like I wasn't looking after him properly and that I was neglecting him when all I was doing was having a look round the shops." She made a complaint and was taken for a chat in the store's cafe where the employee later made an apology. In a statement, Sainsbury's said: "We are deeply concerned by this incident and apologise unreservedly to Mrs Latto for the distress this has caused her. "We are investigating what happened and the store manager would like to meet Mrs Latto to apologise in person." </body>

      <title>Twitter float could raise $1.4bn</title>
      <description>Twitter says it will sell 70 million shares priced between $17 (£10.50) and $20, valuing the microblogging site at as much as $11bn.</description>

      <body>Twitter has unveiled the price range for its shares when the company lists on the stock exchange. In a filing on Thursday, Twitter said it planned to sell 70 million shares priced between $17 and $20 (£10 - £12) to raise up to $1.4bn (£865m). The offering represents 13% of Twitter and values it at as much as $11bn. Analysts said the valuation, which was less than forecast, indicated the firm wanted to avoid the dip in prices that followed Facebook's listing. "They're trying to price this for a very strong IPO, ideally creating the conditions for a solid after-market," said Brian Wieser of the Pivotal Research Group. Facebook's shares were priced initially at $38 per share. The stock soared within hours of its debut to a high of $45 but later slumped. Some analysts had blamed over pricing of the shares as a reason behind the fall. However, Facebook shares have since recouped most of their losses and are now trading above the listing price. Twitter's share sale on the New York Stock Exchange will make it the biggest internet company to go public after Facebook. The microblogging site has seen steady growth since its launch seven years ago. According to its IPO documents, it now has 218 million monthly users and 500 million tweets are sent a day. However, all those users and tweets have not yet resulted in a profit. Twitter made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m. Some analysts said that while the lower-than-expected pricing may help its share prices in the days after the listing, in the long run investors would still need to see the firm make profits. "The fact that the valuation is lower than expectations, I think was smart by the underwriters. I think it will help the pop," said Michael Yoshikami of Destinational Wealth Management. "But in the end, even for $11bn, the question is can they come up with earnings to substantiate that number? And it's unclear that they're going to be able to do that." Almost 85% of Twitter's revenue currently comes from advertising on its site. There are three main ways for a company or an individual to advertise on Twitter: by promoting a tweet that will appear in people's timelines, promoting a whole account, or promoting a trend. Twitter tends to charge its advertisers according to the amount of interaction their content generates. Some analysts say the company has showing strong signs of growth, with revenue rising from just $28m in 2010 to $317m by the end of 2012. One research firm, eMarketer, has even estimated that Twitter's revenues from advertising sales will increase by more than 100% by the end of this year. </body>

      <title>Barroso backs Cameron over red tape</title>

      <body>David Cameron has won the backing of EU chief Jose Manuel Barroso for his push to limit the number of new regulations coming out of Brussels. The two chaired a meeting of EU leaders on the issue at Friday's summit. The prime minister has said firms are being "throttled" by red tape and for every regulation and directive introduced another should be removed. Mr Barroso said more needed to be done to ensure "lighter, simpler, cheaper, common-sense regulation". The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, has said it has already cut 5,590 regulations since 2005. Mr Cameron is committed to renegotiating the UK's relationship with the EU if the Conservative Party wins the next election, ahead of an "in-out" referendum on whether the country should remain a member. In the meantime, he is promising to work to reduce the bureaucracy facing companies. Conservative sources say he wants to see 1,500 regulations reviewed. Eighty business leaders, including the chairmen of BT and Asda, have signed a letter calling for a "strong commitment" by the government towards this and several have accompanied Mr Cameron to Brussels to make the case. The prime minister has made the issue the central objective of the two-day European Council meeting. He held one-to-one meetings with the leaders of Germany and the Netherlands, who share similar views on deregulation, and co-chaired a meeting with the leaders of Poland, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy and Estonia, who are also sympathetic. "The Commission has done an excellent job in lifting the burden of bureaucracy. Now I want to get business engaged," he said, adding that a faster pace of deregulation was essential to getting firms to "compete and succeed". Mr Barroso, the Commission's president, said he appreciated that businesses needed a single set of rules, rather than 28 different bodies of national regulation, for the single market to work and for the important digital economy to continue to grow. Acknowledging that "useless laws weaken necessary laws", he said there were other areas where it was necessary to cut bureaucracy without reducing standards of consumer protection, health and safety and environmental concerns. "That is why we have to slash red tape," he said. </body>

The move follows revelations that US intelligence agencies may have been monitoring the mobile phone of the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and millions of French phone calls.

      <body>A plastic surgeon in the US has offered to operate on a British man once dubbed the world's fattest. At his heaviest, Paul Mason weighed 70 stone (444kg) and was bed bound at his bungalow in Ipswich, Suffolk. He now weighs about 24 stone (152kg) after gastric bypass surgery in 2010 but says his life is being hampered by a huge amount of excess skin. New York-based surgeon Dr Jennifer Capla said she was willing to donate her time to help Mr Mason. In May, Mr Mason, 52, released photographs of his naked body as part of his plea for medical help. Mr Mason said he had begun trying to raise the money to pay for flights and a hospital stay in order to take advantage of Dr Capla's offer. Dr Capla told BBC Radio Suffolk she had read about Mr Mason and his weight loss in the New York Times. "He is a high-risk patient and he has a lot of medical issues that we need to sort through," she said. "However, he's a great candidate for this skin removal surgery. "He has lost over 600lbs (272kg) and he should be very functional and mobile and should be able to live his life but he's still wheelchair-bound because he has all this excess skin. "Helping him get his life back is really the goal." Dr Capla said she specialised in "post-bariatric body contouring" but that although she had treated patients who has lost up to 200lbs (90kg) she had never treated anyone who had lost as much weight as Mr Mason. "The skin is the same in terms of looseness and the areas of target so it's an area I'm very familiar with," she said. Mr Mason said he had "things in motion" to raise the money needed. "All I've got to cover is the medication, the stay in hospital and the flights," she said. Mr Mason has not been able to have the surgery on the NHS because his weight has not been stable. He said an operation to remove excess skin around his middle would make a huge difference. "I would be able to mobilise and lead a reasonably normal life, then have my arms and legs done," he said. "Five years down the road it would possibly have to be repeated because by then I should be at my goal weight and the excess skin I would have then would still need removing because of the extreme size I was in the first place." A spokesman for the NHS Ipswich and East Suffolk Clinical Commissioning Group said: "Before a patient has an operation it is important to take a balanced decision that is in the best interest of that patient. "In cases like this the NHS has a panel of people - including clinicians - who decide whether the patient should have such an operation. A patient must have a stable weight before he or she is considered." </body>

      <title>Get outside and go wild, kids urged</title>
      <description>Children are being urged to take back their 'wild time' by playing outside more to regain a connection with nature.</description>

      <body>Children are being urged to take back their "wild time", swapping 30 minutes of screen use for outdoor activities. The call to renew a connection with nature comes from a collaboration of almost 400 organisations, from playgroups to the NHS. The Wild Network wants children to take up activities like conkers and camping. "The tragic truth is that kids have lost touch with nature and the outdoors in just one generation," said chairman Andy Simpson. The organisers argue that swapping 30 minutes of television and computer games each day for outdoor play would increase the levels of fitness and alertness and improve children's well-being "Time spent outdoors is down, roaming ranges have fallen drastically, activity levels are declining and the ability to identify common species has been lost," said Mr Simpson. He referred to recent research by the RSPB which suggested only one in five children aged eight to 12 had a connection with nature. "With many more parents becoming concerned about the dominance of screen time in their children's lives, and growing scientific evidence that a decline in active time is bad news for the health and happiness of our children, we all need to become marketing directors for nature," said Mr Simpson. "An extra 30 minutes of wild time every day for all under 12-year-olds in the UK would be the equivalent of just three months of their childhood spent outdoors. "We want parents to see what this magical wonder product does for their kids' development, independence and creativity, by giving wild time a go." The campaign launches on Friday with the release of a documentary film, Project Wild Thing. It tells the story of how, in a bid to get his daughter and son outside, film-maker David Bond appoints himself marketing director for nature, working with branding and outdoor experts to develop a campaign. "I wanted to understand why my children's childhood is so different from mine, whether this matters and, if it does, what I can do about it," said Mr Bond. "The reasons why kids, whether they live in cities or the countryside, have become disconnected from nature and the outdoors are complex. "Project Wild Thing isn't some misty-eyed nostalgia for the past. We need to make more space for wild time in children's daily routine, freeing this generation of kids to have the sort of experiences that many of us took for granted. "It's all about finding wildness on your doorstep and discovering the sights, sounds and smells of nature, whether in a back garden, local park or green space at the end of the road." The campaign, said to be the biggest ever aiming to reconnect children with the outdoors, includes the National Trust, the RSPB, Play England and the NHS, as well as playgroups, businesses and schools. </body>

      <body>The FBI has issued wanted posters for a man they say is behind an eBay car scam that has netted $3m (£1.8m). Authorities in the US also want to track down six other fugitives in relation to the charges. The gang were described as "masters of illusion" who convinced people to pay for cars that did not exist. "They thought their distance would insulate them from law enforcement scrutiny. They were wrong," said US attorney Loretta Lynch. The FBI put out a wanted poster for 33-year-old Romanian Nicolae Popescu, charging him with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. "They siphoned funds from victims to fuel their greedy desires and created false identities, fake websites and counterfeit certificates of title in order to make the scheme more convincing," said FBI Assistant Director, George Venizelos. "Popescu and his co-conspirators were masters of illusion, but they can't escape their ultimate reality. "With the help of our law enforcement partners at home and abroad, we will bring them to justice." In a recorded conversation, the FBI said Mr Popescu boasted that he was "beyond the reach" of US authorities. As well as eBay, the gang is said to have used Cars.com, AutoTrader.com, and CycleTrader.com to sell the non-existent cars, usually priced between $10,000 (£6,150) and $40,000 (£24,700). "After the 'sellers' reached an agreement with the victim buyers, they would often email them invoices purporting to be from Amazon Payments, PayPal, or other online payment services, with instructions to transfer the money to the US bank accounts used by the defendants," an FBI statement explained. Romania has gained increasing notoriety as a hub for cybercrime. A report from technology magazine Wired detailed a village dubbed "Hackerville" by locals - where cybercriminals are said to learn their craft at an early age. </body>

      <body>Scientists are starting to understand why one person's face can look so different from another's. Working on mice, researchers have identified thousands of small regions of DNA that influence the way facial features develop. The study also shows that tweaks to genetic material can subtly alter face shape. The findings, published in Science, could also help researchers to learn how facial birth defects arise. The researchers said that although the work was carried out on animals, the human face was likely to develop in the same way. Professor Axel Visel, from the Joint Genome Institute at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, told BBC News: "We're trying to find out how these instructions for building the human face are embedded in human DNA. "Somewhere in there there must be that blueprint that defines what our face looks like." The international team has found more than 4,000 "enhancers" in the mouse genome that appear to play a role in facial appearance. These short stretches of DNA act like switches, turning genes on and off. And for 200 of these, the researchers have identified how and where they work in developing mice. Prof Visel said: "In the mouse embryos we can see where exactly, as the face develops, this switch turns on the gene that it controls." The scientists also looked at what happened when three of these genetic switches were removed from mice. "These mice looked pretty normal, but it is really hard for humans to see differences in the face of mice," explained Prof Visel. "The way we can get around this is to use CT scans to study the shapes of the skulls of these mice. We take them and scan their heads. then we can measure the shape of the skull of these mice and we can do this in a very precise way." By comparing the transgenic mice with unmodified mice, the researchers found that the changes were very subtle. However some mice developed longer or shorter skulls, while others have wider or narrower faces. "What this really tells us is that this particular switch also plays a role in development of the skull and can affect what exactly the skull looks like," he explained. Understanding this could also help to reveal why and how things can go wrong as embryos develop in the womb, leading to facial birth defects. Prof Visel said: "There are many kinds of craniofacial birth defects; cleft of the lip and palate are the most common ones. "And they have severe implications for the kids that are affected. They affect feeding, speech, breathing, they can require extensive surgery and they have psychological implications." While some of these are caused by genetic mutations, the researchers want to understand how the genetic switches interact. Professor Visel added that scientists were just at the beginning of understanding the processes that shape the face, but their early results suggested it was an extremely complex process. He said it was unlikely in the near future that DNA could be used to predict someone's exact appearance, or that parents could alter genetic material to change the way a baby looks. </body>

      <body>It is a year to the day since the news that ash dieback had been found in Britain's native woodland was officially confirmed. The announcement sparked a deal of hand wringing and some dire predictions - it would be Armageddon in the countryside, as the disease that had decimated European forests let rip in this green and pleasant land. It was even claimed that a third of Britain's trees might be lost in little more than a generation. The Today programme's science correspondent Tom Feilden investigates what actually happened, and what, if anything, we do about it.

      <body>Actors David Tennant and Olivia Coleman have helped ITV's Broadchurch win four prizes - dubbed the Daggers - at the Specsavers Crime Thriller Awards. The pair picked up the best actor and actress awards for their roles in the drama, with co-star Andrew Buchan named best supporting actor. Broadchurch also won the TV prize, with Bond movie Skyfall named best film. Martina Cole and Wilbur Smith were also inducted into the Crime Writers' Association Hall of Fame at the event. The pair were honoured in recognition of their contributions to the genre. The awards - which marked the culmination of ITV3's Crime Thriller Book Club - included a new award for the club's best read, which went to Malcolm MacKay for The Necessary Death Of Lewis Winter. After beating books by Linwood Barclay, Megan Abbott, Christopher Fowler, Diana Bretherick and Andrew Taylor, the author said it was "a huge honour and thrill to win". Mick Herron picked up the coveted Gold Dagger award for best crime novel of the year for Dead Lions. "My shelves are crammed with Gold Dagger-winning novels of the past - The Mermaids Singing, Black and Blue, Bones and Silence. I can't quite believe I get to put my own book next to them," he said. The best new crime writer prize went to Derek B Miller for his debut novel Norwegian By Night Roger, while Roger Hobbs's Ghostman was named best thriller of the year. Other awards went to Amelia Bullmore, who won best supporting actress for her role in ITV's Scott and Bailey, while Danish series The Killing III won the best international TV prize. The ceremony will be shown on ITV3 on 27 October at 21:00GMT. </body>

      <body>Long before the Metro, the steam trains of Petite Ceinture ("Little Belt" in English) connected Paris's main railway stations carrying people around the city along the path of its ancient walls. The circular line went into gradual decline from the 1930s, when competition arrived in the form of the more modern underground Metro system. For 32km (almost 20 miles) the tracks of Petite Ceinture snake through bustling Paris, isolated and largely unseen from street level in deep trenches, long tunnels, and bridges. Nature has reclaimed the space and it has become a haven for wild flowers and animals. The line is officially off-limits to the public, but this hasn't stopped many people attempting to explore it. There is now a fierce debate in the French capital about what to do with the tracks and stations of the Petite Ceinture that still remain. A small section opened as a park in August 2013 and the mayoral elections offer competing plans for cycle routes and parks. Associations set up to preserve the space would prefer to see the line reopened for pedestrian services. BBC News joined Thomas Jorion - a photographer who has been documenting the line since 1996 - on a tour of what he calls the last great wasteland in Paris.

      <title>Coffee v smoothies: Which is better for you?</title>
      <description>At first glance it seems clear that a smoothie is a healthier option. The answer may not be so clear-cut, says Michael Mosley.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24621394</url>

      <body>One is made of fruit. The other is caffeinated. So a smoothie is a healthier option than a coffee, right? Don't be so sure, says Michael Mosley, as he weighs the evidence. Which is healthier - coffee or smoothies? It seems obvious that the answer must be a smoothie. After all, drinking coffee is a necessary evil while having a smoothie, made from fruit, is part of your five-a-day. But when you look into the scientific studies they reveal something much more surprising. Let's start with coffee. There have been numerous claims down the years that drinking coffee will increase your risk of a whole range of terrible things from heart disease to cancer. These claims have been largely based on case control studies, where you take a group of people who drink coffee and compare them with another matched group who don't. The problem with this approach is that coffee drinkers are more likely than non-coffee drinkers to have other "bad" habits, like drinking alcohol or smoking, so it is hard to tease apart what is really doing the harm. A more reliable way to get at the truth is to do what is called a prospective cohort study. You take a group of disease-free individuals, collect data about them, then follow them for a large number of years to see what happens. When scientists collected data on the coffee drinking habits of 130,000 men and women and then followed them for over 20 years they found that coffee is rather a good thing (The Relationship of Coffee Consumption with Mortality, Annals of Internal Medicine, June 2008). They crunched the numbers and concluded that "regular coffee consumption was not associated with an increased mortality rate in either men or women". In fact, data from this study suggests that moderate coffee consumption is mildly protective, leading to slightly lower all-cause mortality in coffee drinkers than non-coffee drinkers. Based on this and other studies the most effective "dose" is two to five cups a day. More than that and any benefits drop off. There are hundreds of different substances in coffee, including many different flavonoids (compounds widely found in plants that have antioxidant effects). Which of these ingredients is beneficial, we simply don't know. When it comes to the brain, however, the answer seems to be "caffeine". In research recently published in the World Journal of Biological Psychiatry (July 2013) they found that people who drank two to four cups of caffeinated coffee a day were half as likely to commit suicide as those who either drank decaff or fewer than two cups a day. This research pulled together data from three studies that had followed more than 200,000 people for more than 14 years, so it's pretty reliable. It is also supported by a number of other studies, which makes this claim even more plausible. One reason why caffeine may be a mild anti-depressant is that as well as making you more alert, it increases levels of neurotransmitters in the brain, like dopamine and serotonin, that are known to improve mood. The researchers don't recommend going overboard, noting that "there is little further benefit for consumption above two to three cups". One note of caution is that these trials began many years ago so the sort of coffee consumption being tested is almost certainly good, old-fashioned coffee. A simple mug of coffee delivers somewhere between zero and 60 calories, depending on whether it is black, white or white with one sugar. Cappuccinos, lattes and mochas contain coffee but they also contain a lot of calories - anything between 100 and 600 - so when it comes to fancy coffees I limit myself to the occasional tall, skinny cappuccino (70 calories). But what about fruit smoothies? They may consist of pure fruit but by the time you've got rid of the peel and mashed the fibre then you have already lost many of the potential health benefits. What you are mainly left with is a sugary drink. In a survey published in early 2013, researchers found that out of 52 commercial smoothies, 41 had more sugar than Coca-Cola (a 12oz can contains the equivalent of about nine teaspoons), and all had more calories. Fruit smoothies are acidic and the bits cling to your teeth, so dentists are not enthusiastic. An apple a day may keep the doctor away, but not when it's been peeled, blended, mashed and packaged. In a study published in August 2013 in the British Medical Journal (Fruit Consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes) they found that while eating fruit cuts your risk of developing diabetes, drinking it appears to increase the risk. This was another big study involving lots of people followed for many years. An interesting finding was that different fruits gave different levels of benefit. Three servings of blueberries, for example, cut the risk of diabetes by 26%, while eating apples, pears, bananas and grapefruits also had a positive, albeit much smaller, effect. Overall those who ate fruit cut their risk of developing diabetes by 2%, while those who drank it (more than three glasses of fruit juice a week) increased their risk by 8%. More bad news for fruit juice drinkers comes from a case-controlled study done in Western Australia that examined the daily diets of more than 2,000 people. They found that eating some types of fruit and vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower and apples) cuts your risk of colorectal cancer, while drinking fruit juice was associated with an increased risk of rectal cancer. Sugary drinks lead to raised levels of the hormone insulin and persistently high levels of insulin are associated with increased risk of some cancers. The researchers point out that many things that protect against bowel cancer, such as antioxidants and fibre, are lost or diminished during the juicing process. None of these studies specifically looked at the health benefits or otherwise of fruit smoothies, which are a relatively recent phenomenon, nor did they look at the impact of different types of juice - for instance, whether it was freshly squeezed or from concentrate, home-made or shop-bought. I would assume, for example, that drinking a home-made vegetable smoothie is going to be a lot better for you than a commercial fruit smoothie. And I very much doubt that the occasional fruit juice or fruit smoothie is going to do any harm. Nonetheless, I've personally given up buying them and we rarely have them in the house. I eat whole fruit and when it comes to soft drinks I'm sticking to water, tea and, of course, coffee. Trust Me I'm A Doctor is broadcast on BBC Two at 20:00 BST on Thursday 24 October, or catch up with iPlayer Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook Michael Mosley answered readers' questions on Twitter using #AskMichael. Q: The article seems to conflate smoothies and juices re lack of fibre. Does fibre in a handmade smoothie blunt insulin? A: Commercial juices and smoothies are lower in fibre than eating fruit and veg. Handmade ones may be better but will still be lower than fruit and veg. Eating apples will keep you feeling full for longer than drinking same amount as apple juice. I met someone who takes it to the extreme. He peels the apple, eats the peel, throw rest away. Q: Why do you persist in offering fad diets when we have the examples of sportsmen who just eat right and exercise? A: The simple message, "eat less, do more exercise" simply doesn't work with most people. It's time to acknowledge that. Q: Is it ok to eat 4 fruits each day, eg: banana, grapes, apple, orange? Is this too much sugar? A: Banana and grapes have lots sugar. Apples, pears and berries have less sugar. Vegetables generally have lower GI and calories. Commercial smoothies are often banana based, so they have lots of sugar and calories. Q: What is worse? High fat, low carbohydrate or high carbohydrate low fat diets? A: I think the important thing is the type of carbohydrates and type of fat. Highly processed food is bad. Q: It seems what we are told is either good or bad for us changes like the wind. How do we know what to believe? A: The problem is that many health beliefs are based on poor studies. The best option is a prospective cohort study. In a prospective cohort study you follow people over time, not at a moment in time. When this was done for coffee drinking it was shown to be mildly beneficial. Q: I only ever have proper butter, never spreads or margarine. Do I need to only have tiny amounts though? A: I eat butter rather than margarine, as do many cardiologists I know. But it's rich in calories, so I am restrained. Q: Any good news on the horizon for chronic migraine? A: On Trust Me I'm a Doctor we looked at Botox which seems to work quite well for chronic migraine. Q: Drinking enough water is important, but how important is the pH value in tap water? A: The idea we should drink 2 litres a day is a myth. Drink when you're thirsty. I don't know about the effect of pH in water. Q: Is one banana a day too many? A: No. Eating fruit is generally good. Q: Yes or no, should we drink pure fruit smoothies? A: I don't. If it tastes sweet it has lots of sugar. Some have more than 10 teaspoons of sugar. </body>

      <body>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says talk of boycotting the 2018 World Cup in Russia in protest at racism among the country's fans is premature. Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure has suggested black players could take action, after claiming he was abused during Wednesday's game at CSKA Moscow. "You have to fight racism, in Russia or wherever in the world," said Wenger. "To go as extreme as suggested (a boycott), it's a bit early to do that because it's not proven what happened." The Frenchman added: "You cannot tolerate racism. But I believe Russia itself has to fight against it." Uefa is investigating Toure's complaint that he was subjected to racist abuse by some CSKA supporters during the 2-1 Champions League win in Moscow. The Russian club denies any racist chanting took place. And on Friday, the governing body's president, Michel Platini, ordered an internal investigation  into why proper protocol was not followed in the handling of the incident. Platini's statement comes a day after Kick It Out  chairman Lord Ouseley said that the match referee Ovidiu Hategan should not officiate again for failing to deal with the alleged abuse. Meanwhile, former Manchester City chief executive Garry Cook has said Toure's comments might have been made in the "heat of the moment". "Yaya Toure is the talent, engaging in the game, and he's creating a lot of fans and a lot of enjoyment," he said. "I think we tend to make rash decisions in the heat of the moment. "The game itself needs to collaborate and support and make sure we have a clear strategy and policy against racism. "There is a lot more consideration to be given to the issue, but the governing body need to have a very strong stand and make their point well." </body>

      <body>Sebastian Vettel would not be "afraid" of taking on one of Formula 1's other leading names as his team-mate but insists he has nothing to prove. The German can clinch a fourth world title in India on Sunday but has to face claims his remarkable success is largely down to having the best car. Red Bull resisted opportunities in the last 18 months to sign Lewis Hamilton, Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso. "One day maybe I will race alongside Kimi or Fernando," Vettel said. "It depends how long we stick around. But I am not afraid of that because you want to beat the guys on the track and you want to find out who is the best." Vettel, who has won the last five races in a row, needs only a fifth place in the Indian Grand Prix to be absolutely sure of the title. Only Ferrari's Fernando Alonso is mathematically able to beat him, but is 90 points behind with only 100 still available. The Spaniard needs to out-score Vettel by 16 points on Sunday to prolong the championship to the next race in Abu Dhabi next weekend. Vettel, who was talking in an exclusive BBC Sport interview to be broadcast ahead of the race on Sunday, rejected a suggestion that he needs to take on Alonso, Hamilton or Raikkonen in another car to prove his greatness to any doubters. "You can think about this a lot," he said. "I think we don't have to prove anything. I think we have proven enough. "We have had three fantastic years. This year has been fantastic. I believe things happen for a reason. "For sure you need the right package. We had a very strong package the last couple of years. I believe we had a very strong package in 2009, when we finished second in the championship. "With the experience I have today maybe 2009 would have been different. At the time I did the best I could. I did mistakes, I still do now, but the most important thing is I learn from them. "You can find lots of difficulties I had to face. [Last year] we got sent to the back of the grid in Abu Dhabi and had to come back, we had a nightmare race in Brazil. "We managed to come back [and seal the championship]. It was a bit tight in some places, a bit lucky. We worked very hard for what we have achieved basically, as a team. "For sure some people will think you have to do this and that. The most important is to prove something to yourself." Asked how he felt he compared as a driver to Hamilton and Alonso, Vettel said: "It's difficult because I don't know what they do. I can see what they do on the track. I don't know how much time they spend setting up the car, how much they care. "I'm sure we all care because no-one wants to drive a car that is set up badly, but for sure some people invest more time and some less. I don't think there is a right and wrong, it is what you feel happy with."

      <body>Anyone who saw England lose to Italy on Saturday in a warm-up game they were supposed to stroll would probably have a one-word answer to the above question - no. If England cannot beat Italy what hope do they have against tournament favourites Australia, who they play in the opening fixture on Saturday? Since 2008, England have played Australia five times, losing all of them and never finishing within 10 points of their opponents - who have quality throughout their side. "Cameron Smith, Billy Slater, Johnathan Thurston, Cooper Cronk, Greg Inglis - they have loads of world-class players and we know what is coming," England skipper Kevin Sinfield tells BBC Sport. "They seem to have a conveyor belt - when one retires another one just rolls off it." Since a shock defeat on home soil by New Zealand in the 2008 World Cup final, the Kangaroos have won 17 out of 19 fixtures, a draw and a narrow defeat against the Kiwis the only blots on their copybook. Australia have won the World Cup nine out of 13 times - and they want their trophy back. "They are formidable and they are the team to beat," says England coach Steve McNamara. Before losing to Italy, McNamara's team won six fixtures in a row, against Wales, France and an Exiles side made up of some of the best imports in Super League. But they have not played either the Kangaroos or New Zealand - the sport's top two international teams - since 2011. When England walk out at the Millennium Stadium to kick off the World Cup, they will be taking a step into the unknown. But discarding the sizeable bump in the road against Italy - and the removal of Gareth Hock from the squad for "serious breaches of team discipline" - there is an optimism inside the camp that the hard work done since McNamara stepped up from assistant boss in 2010 has given them a superb chance of upsetting the odds and winning the World Cup. "It will be tough but we are capable," said McNamara. "I take great confidence from the work we have done over a long, sustained period of time." The former Bradford Bulls coach found there were big issues to address when he took over - none more so than the identity of the team. He added: "What was the England rugby league team? It was a new brand with no spiritual home, like Twickenham or Wembley." The side still does not have a home ground but whenever they get together now it is at Loughborough University. Ask McNamara about the blend in his 24-man squad and he will stress again and again how hard his coaching team have worked to build a "two-team mentality". By this he means that representing England is not just something players do at the end of a long club season - a last hit-out before a holiday - but a fundamental part of their identity. Meaningless nonsense lifted from some management manual? Not according to Sinfield. "It has long been said that it is difficult to unite players from different clubs in a national side, but we have spent so many hours, so many days trying to break down barriers," says the skipper. "People who don't know us might look and think it is made up - just plastic, false - but to be part of it is really refreshing." Perhaps this team spirit and togetherness can help carry the squad through the difficult moments, when they have to defend back-to-backs sets, when all they can see in front of them is a snarling line of green and gold. "It might sound fuzzy to hear rugby league players talking about caring for each other, but I think this could be one of the big strengths of our group," adds Sinfield. England's preparations for the World Cup featured high-altitude training in South Africa, using the same base they visited last year. It is the same site used by Spain for the 2010 World Cup. Last year, McNamara had the room used by Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta. Of course, England could be the best prepared team in world sport, but without ability it would be pointless. McNamara's squad has inevitably suffered injuries - the loss of Brisbane centre Jack Reed and Leeds second-rower Jamie Jones-Buchanan in particular - but they have five players steeled in the Australian National Rugby League to supplement those from Super League. "The ones in the NRL are not only playing with and against the best every week, they are right at the top of the game, not just contributing slightly," says McNamara. None more so than the Burgess brothers - Sam, 24, and 21-year-old twins George and Tom. All are huge - and a huge story down under, where the sport has a much higher profile than in their native England. They are key players at the South Sydney Rabbitohs club owned by Russell Crowe. McNamara reckons that nobody has benefited more from their presence than New Zealand hooker Isaac Luke, who made 2,180 metres in the NRL last season compared to a league average of 1,047 metres. Canterbury Bulldog James Graham and Melbourne Storm half-back Gareth Widdop complete the NRL contingent. Full-back Sam Tomkins is the world's most expensive player, winger Josh Charnley scored the most tries last season as Wigan completed the Challenge Cup and Grand Final double. Sinfield is a superb goal-kicker and the pack looks strong with a mobile hooker in James Roby. Not that this will unsettle the Australians. England's inability to defend their line against Italy was concerning, as was their failure to score any points in the second half. Italy, to be fair, had a sprinkling of strong NRL talent in their side, but they are without their first-choice half-back pairing of Terry Campese and Craig Gower, and should have been easily despatched by a team quietly confident of winning the World Cup for the first time since 1972. Kangaroos coach Tim Sheens watched that game and has since been making all the right noises about not underestimating England in the light of their defeat against Italy - but he does not reflect public opinion back home. "Most Australians believe it's a formality that their team will regain the World Cup," says former professional Tulsen Tollett, who was raised in Australia and who now works for BBC Sport. "Although English sport has gradually - if not begrudgingly - become respected by Australians for what it has achieved in the past few years, rugby league needs a performance reminiscent of England winning the Ashes in 2005 if there's to be a complete mentality change down under." Of course, defeat on Saturday against Australia would hardly be the end of England's hopes - three out of the four sides in their group qualify for the last eight. But it would leave them with the probability of a tough semi-final against New Zealand. "If we perform well enough we could go on and win the tournament but it's a long way off after the Italy game," adds Sinfield. And right now very few people would disagree with him. </body>

      <title>Hamilton: We must do something about child poverty</title>
      <description>Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton, the 2008 world champion, talks about his experiences in India in his latest BBC Sport column</description>

      <body>This weekend is only the third time Formula 1 has raced in India, but I think I have been to the country about eight times now, taking into account various appearances of one kind and another. Every visit here, I've had an amazing time. Of course, you see a lot of poverty on the streets. It's very different from back in Europe or most places on the F1 calendar. There are kids running around without shoes, people with diseases and all the stuff everyone knows about. But it is still such a great country. I have done a bit of work here for Unicef, the United Nations children's charity, and it's always the kids who are my main concern. I love being around children and I've always been good with the kids in my family or those of my friends. They are the future and I feel like I am in a privileged position to help others try to raise awareness for a lot of the big issues around the world, the sorts of things most of us who live in wealthier countries are not always conscious of as we go about our daily lives. Last year, I went to visit a village which had a problem with babies dying. I had no idea before I went that so many kids were not making it. It was a very rural area and a lot of women were having children pretty young - 15, 16, 17 - and they had no way of getting to hospital. So they would give birth on the floor and wouldn't know how to look after the baby, which would then die because it might not have enough to eat or get ill. Sometimes, the women died, too. So Unicef came up with a system which meant that women who were about to give birth could send just one text and a bus would come to pick them up. Another place I went with Unicef was the Philippines, another country where there is a lot of poverty. It was amazing to see the street kids there. They're so loving. They come over and hold your hand. They don't want any money, they just want to play with you. They wanted to know if I could do the 'Dougie'. I had the most fantastic time with them. The family I spent most time with were living in a cart with just an awning over the top. It is disgusting the way that this can still happen in today's world, when our society has achieved so much with technology, communication and intelligent thinking. I just don't understand it and yet there are street kids like that living in poverty all over the developing world. It's insane and it makes me wonder how we - the human race - can continue to neglect the neediest people in society and what we need to do to change things. I'd like to help in any way I can. The Indian Grand Prix is not on the calendar next year and there is a lot of talk at the moment that this might be the last time F1 comes to the country. I find myself in conflict about that. A lot of money has been spent building this massive track with a huge road leading to it, yet just outside there are people living on the street. On the other hand, the track employs people, while the race itself brings tourists to India and raises awareness of the country. It will be a shame if we don't come back. All that money would have been spent to build this great facility and it would be left to sit and rot. There is so much more they could do with this place. Imagine if they opened it to loads of kids and got them into the sport. I'm sure there are things we could do to make this race one of the most amazing in F1. Sebastian Vettel will almost certainly win the championship on Sunday and I could understand if people then thought everything was wrapped up for the season. But there will still be a lot to watch and get excited about in the final three grands prix of the campaign. There is a lot of fighting going on behind the Red Bulls, especially between Ferrari and Lotus and my team Mercedes for second place in the constructors' championship. And each individual race is almost like a mini-world championship, the equivalent of a Champions League final, say. They're all in different countries, so if you win in Montreal, for example, you are the champion of Montreal for that year. The same goes for India. I love racing and want to be at the centre of the action. And I've not won in India yet. I'll be doing my utmost to make that happen this weekend.

      <title>3D printer 'gun parts' found in raid</title>

      <body>A 3D printer and suspected "homemade" gun components seized during police raids in Manchester are being examined. Detectives initially said the parts were a "plastic magazine and trigger" which could make a "viable" gun. But the man held on suspicion of making gunpowder has told the BBC they are actually sections of a 3D printer. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) now say they "cannot categorically say" whether they had recovered the component parts for a gun. A force spokesman said if the tests showed the parts could make a functioning weapon it would be the "first ever seizure of this kind in the UK". Det Insp Chris Mossop, of GMP, said: "If what we have seized is proven to be viable components capable of constructing a genuine firearm, then it demonstrates that organised crime groups are acquiring technology that can be bought on the high street to produce the next generation of weapons. "In theory, the technology essentially allows offenders to produce their own guns in the privacy of their own home, which they can then supply to the criminal gangs who are causing such misery in our communities. "Because they are also plastic and can avoid X-ray detection, it makes them easy to conceal and smuggle." He added: "If what we have seized today can, as we suspect, be used to make a genuine firearm then today will be an important milestone in the fight against this next generation of homemade weapons." The BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said the discovery was "almost inevitable" because of the relatively few firearms in circulation. "The worst-case-scenario would be a cheap and 100% reliable device that could be made overnight and then destroyed after just one use, disposing of crucial evidence to pin to a suspect," he added. The raid was part of GMP's Operation Challenger, which aims to "dismantle" organised criminal gangs. Counterfeit goods worth £2m, more than £330,000 of drugs and £25,000 cash, have been seized in a crackdown. 3D printing technology works by building up layer upon layer of material - typically plastic - to create complex solid objects. Desktop 3D printers can be bought on the high street for less than £1,000, but prices can be as high as £10,000. The world's first gun made with 3D printer technology was successfully fired in the US in May. The group that created the firearm, Defense Distributed, said it planned to make the blueprints available online. Defense Distributed is headed by Cody Wilson, a 25-year-old law student at the University of Texas, who defended making the design available by saying: "I'm seeing a world where technology says you can pretty much be able to have whatever you want. "It's not up to the political players anymore." At the time, Europe's law enforcement agency Europol said it feared criminals would follow suit as the technology became cheaper and more user friendly. </body>

      <body>A teenager who died after jumping from a ferry on New Year's Eve may have done it as a result of alcohol-fuelled bravado, a coroner says. Jordan Cobb, 16, from Plymouth, was with friends when he went into the River Tamar from the Torpoint ferry near the Cornish shore. The inquest in Plymouth heard claims it might have been over a £100 bet. Ruling accidental death, coroner Ian Arrow said Jordan made his own decision and he was sure he did not mean to die. "We can't be certain why he dived off, whether it was bravado or for some other reason. I am satisfied he certainly didn't expect to die," Mr Arrow said. Jordan had been drinking with friends in Plymouth before the group decided to head to Torpoint, the hearing was told. He was filmed on CCTV leaping into the river at about 21:15 GMT. Witnesses told the coroner the group had moved towards the front of the ferry as it approached Torpoint when Jordan said "something like 'shall I jump off?'", but the comments were not taken seriously. He then asked a friend to hold his bag, climbed on top of a barrier and dived overboard. Witnesses saw Jordan go underwater and re-emerge to begin swimming for the shore before losing sight of him. Daily searches involving the police, coastguard and the Ministry of Defence were carried out after Jordan, who went to the city's Stoke Damerel Community College, vanished. His body was found on 16 January. The inquest heard a witness statement from two girls on the Torpoint side of the river, which claimed they heard a male who was part of Jordan's group say: "It was a £100 bet ... it was supposed to be me, but Jordan jumped in." Torpoint ferries are pulled across the River Tamar on chains and are an important travel link between Plymouth, Devon and Torpoint in Cornwall. </body>

      <description>Scottish Labour's Cara Hilton wins the Dunfermline by-election for the Scottish Parliament, taking the seat from the SNP.</description>

      <body>Labour has won the Scottish Parliament by-election in Dunfermline, after beating the SNP by almost 3,000 votes. The victory represented a gain from the SNP, who took the seat in the 2011 Holyrood election. The by-election was caused by the resignation of sitting MSP Bill Walker, who was thrown out of the SNP and jailed for domestic abuse. Cara Hilton, the parliament's newest MSP, said the people of Dunfermline "deserved better". The SNP won Dunfermline as part of its landslide election win in 2011 with a majority of just 590 votes, but was not able to hold on. In the end, Labour took the seat with a majority of 2,873 - a 7% swing from the SNP. The Liberal Democrats came third in the contest, with the Conservatives in fourth place. Ms Hilton said: "After the disgrace of Bill Walker, Dunfermline deserves better and I will ensure that we will be better - far better than what went before." And ahead of the SNP administration's independence referendum next year, she added: "We need a Scottish government that will address the needs of Scots, not one that will simply make promises about what will happen after 2016. "Today Dunfermline has sent a message to Bute House and Alex Salmond: it's time for you to focus on the real priorities of Scots, not your constitutional obsession." The by-election campaign centred on contentious local issues, including proposed school closures, while the SNP focused on its national policies such as the council tax freeze and the decision to remove the tolls on the nearby Forth Road Bridge. Despite the result, SNP candidate Shirley-Anne Somerville said she was proud of the campaign she fought. "We've run a positive campaign trying to support local parents in their schools and I hope we can come together, all of us in the party, to make sure those three schools in the Dunfermline constituency stay open," she said. The Liberal Democrats saw their vote drop by 8% on the night. Candidate Susan Leslie said: "I think it has been a victory for women in politics in Scotland that four women stood in this by-election and fought positive campaigns on the issues for Dunfermline." Scottish Conservative candidate James Reekie - whose party saw a 1% increase in its vote - added: "When the people of Dunfermline are faced with the dilemma of Labour and the SNP, they chose the Conservatives." Turnout in the by-election was 42.65%. </body>

      <body>A major search has been launched after a passenger was reported missing from a ferry in the Northern Isles. The passenger - believed to be in his 40s - was thought to have gone overboard from the NorthLink ferry Hrossey, which was sailing from Kirkwall in Orkney to Lerwick in Shetland. The area being searched is to the east of the island of Sanday in Orkney. Three lifeboats and a coastguard helicopter were involved in the search. A fisheries protection vessel and a local fishing boat were also assisting. Ferry operator NorthLink said the captain of the Hrossey was notified of the incident at about 04:00. They said he immediately turned his vessel to begin a search for the passenger. The MV Hrossey left Kirkwall at 00:25 and had been due to arrive in Lerwick at 07:30. It had 172 passengers on board. Hrossey was later released from the search, and headed to Lerwick. </body>

      <body>A man has been found guilty of the attempted murder of County Armagh woman Natasha McShane and her friend Stacy Jurich in Chicago three years ago. Heriberto Viramontes, 34, was convicted at Cook County Criminal Court in the US city on Thursday. The pair were attacked and robbed in the early hours of 23 April, 2010. Ms McShane, who had been attending the University of Illinois at the time of the assault, has been left with severe brain damage. Just before 18:00 local time - midnight UK time - on Thursday, her family, along with Stacy Jurich and her family, were called for the verdict. The trial lasted five days, it took three and a half hours to find Viramontes guilty on all charges. There were emotional scenes as the verdicts were delivered. Shortly afterwards, a statement written by Natasha's brother, Conor, was read out to the press by the state's attorney. "This crime against my sister has changed my life forever. It has had a devastating impact on our entire family," the statement said. Conor McShane said the family was pleased and relieved at the verdicts. But he also said that Natasha's life had been ruined by the attack. She has been left unable to talk or walk unaided. Stacy Jurich said that the time since the attack had been the most difficult in her life. "We have had a lot of support from our families, friends and complete strangers," she said. "But the last three and a half years have been the hardest time in my entire life. Not only was it a struggle for me, but it has been a struggle to face what happened to my best friend, Natasha - something I will never forget." Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez said: "Chicago is a beautiful city, it is a shame that someone like Natasha McShane, who was here to continue her schooling, someone who was visiting from Ireland, that she was not able to enjoy all the beauty that Chicago has to offer. "Instead of welcoming our visitors with an open heart, she was confronted with a baseball bat. I am very pleased that this man has been held responsible for the brutal and senseless beating of both Stacy Jurich and Natasha McShane." Viramontes faces between six and 120 years in prison. In July, his accomplice Marcy Cruz was jailed for 22 years after pleading guilty to two counts of attempted murder over the attack. </body>

      <description>US engineering firm Caterpillar says a £7m investment in its Northern Ireland factories will create new jobs.</description>

      <body>US engineering firm Caterpillar says a £7m investment in its Northern Ireland factories will create new jobs. The company is to begin manufacturing vehicles used in the scrap metal and forestry industries. Currently the firm only makes generators across its plants at Larne, Belfast, Springvale and Monkstown. The new operation will require 100 positions. Some will be new jobs while others will involve retraining existing staff. In September 2012, the firm cut more than 700 jobs as it moved some manufacturing to China. It later added about 200 jobs in a "shared services centre" which provides back-office support for Caterpillar's global operations. Caterpillar Northern Ireland operations director Robert Kennedy said all of its local plants would benefit from the investment. "We are very pleased to have the support of Invest NI and the Department for Employment and Learning to make this investment which will enable new work to come to Northern Ireland, providing an important addition to our existing operations. "This expansion recognises the high standard of the facilities, processes and skills in Northern Ireland." The announcement was made by the first and deputy first ministers, who are in the US on a business development trip. Peter Robinson said: "The project is especially important as it has the potential to help attract additional projects from the wider Caterpillar family. "This new project for Northern Ireland will also offer our local workforce the opportunity to develop key transferable skills that will add value to our manufacturing sector, bringing further economic benefit." Martin McGuinness said: "This £7m investment supported by a range of assistance, from both Invest NI and the Department for Employment and Learning, will ensure that Caterpillar has the support it needs to fully realise its manufacturing potential within this key area. "The 100 quality manufacturing positions required to run the operation will generate salaries in the region of £2.2m annually, ensuring that existing employees and local people have an opportunity to progress high value career development opportunities." The ministers made the announcement after meeting senior management at Caterpillar's headquarters in Peoria, Illinois. Invest Northern Ireland offered Caterpillar more than £1m to secure the project, and the Department for Employment and Learning offered £220,000 through its Assured Skills Programme. US-based Caterpillar bought over the Northern Ireland engineering firm FG Wilson - which makes diesel generator sets - in 1999. </body>

      <title>'Devastating' college cuts warning</title>
      <description>Cuts to further education budgets in Wales are "short-sighted" and could damage life-long learning, say teaching unions and charities.</description>

      <body>Cuts to further education (FE) budgets in Wales are "short-sighted" and could damage life-long learning, say teaching unions and charities. The Welsh government is proposing £44.9m of cuts in the FE sector next year and a further £42.5m the following year. The ATL teaching union said there would be a "devastating" impact. The Welsh government said it would work closely with colleges "to minimise the impact of any reductions on learning". Most of the proposed cuts will fall on post-19 further education, which is losing almost a quarter of a £160m budget. "We're talking about very positive things here, about courses which help with the difficult to reach, which help the Neets (not in education, employment or training), those who have been out of work for a long time, courses which help people to upskill and get better jobs," said Dr Phil Dixon from the ATL union. "And I think if those go, then a lot of people in the sector will be very demoralised." His concerns have been echoed by the University and College Union (UCU), which said colleges would struggle to deliver the level of services needed in Wales if the cuts went ahead. "The FE sector is a key player that should not be ignored," said a UCU spokesperson. "It provides a lifeline for many adults who want a second chance at education, enabling them to improve opportunities for themselves and therefore their children. "If reducing child poverty is a top priority for the Welsh government, the role that FE can play in this needs to be taken seriously and funded accordingly." Last year there were almost 250,000 learners in FE colleges in Wales, with three-quarters over the age of 19 and many studying part time. The colleges provide courses on a huge range of subjects including everything from basket weaving and brick laying to advanced manufacturing and engineering. Many of the courses are vocational but academic qualifications are also offered. The Welsh government's own analysis said the cuts would have a disproportionate impact on women, who are more likely to be adult learners, as well as those from an ethnic minority background. It also said it would make it more difficult for those who are out of work to re-train. The National Institute of Adult Continuing Education in Wales (NIACE) charity, said there were "wider benefits" in adult learning and now was not a time to cut the budget. "The effect of the cuts will be a reduction of the number of adult learners in Wales and NIACE Dysgu Cymru would advocate that at such a difficult time, we should be maintaining or even increasing funding for life-long learning for all sorts of reasons," said Essex Havard from NIACE. "There is a lot of research around the area of being an active learner and being a healthy adult, particularly in the area around mental health issues... adult learning can help people to get on with their lives after trauma, for example. "So these are the things we'd want to talk to the Welsh government about - about the wider benefits of adult learning, and of the wider impact of those cuts on the adult learning and life-long education budget." The Welsh government has protected provision aimed at 16-19 year olds, so post-19 further education will bear the brunt of the cuts. Around £37m is due to be cut from post-19 learning next year, a 23% reduction from its £160m budget. Responding to the criticisms about the cuts, the Welsh government said it had been "open about the stark reality" of the financial challenges being faced. "But as we work through these difficult times, it is ever more important that we focus not just on the resources that are available but how we use them and what we achieve," said a spokesperson. "We will work closely with the post-16 sector to evaluate available options and to minimise the impact of any reductions on learning. "This will be the case for any sector that may be impacted by reductions." </body>

Michael O'Brien and two other men spent 11 years in jail after they were wrongly found guilty of killing Cardiff newsagent Phillip Saunders, 52. Known as the Cardiff Newsagent Three, Mr O'Brien, Darren Hall and Ellis Sherwood, were jailed in 1988. They were cleared on appeal in 1999. Mr O'Brien applied for judicial review of a Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decision that there was insufficient evidence to charge retired Det Insp Stuart Lewis. The application is being heard at London's High Court by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, who is sitting with Mr Justice Irwin. Lord Thomas told Heather Williams QC, appearing for Mr O'Brien: "The key issue we have to consider is whether the decision that has been made by the CPS was one no reasonable prosecutor would have reached." Ms Williams is arguing the CPS decision was "perverse" because of a failure to take into account relevant matters and a flawed information-gathering process. Lord Thomas ruled that the press and media can report the fact that Mr O'Brien's application is being made to the court, but not the details of the case. Mr Saunders died five days after being attacked and robbed close to his home in Canton, Cardiff, in October 1987. He had returned home in his van after working at his newsagent kiosk at Cardiff bus station and suffered a fractured skull. The jailing of the Cardiff Newsagent Three for the killing is regarded as one of the country's most notorious miscarriages of justice cases. </body>

      <title>ICC rules against Kenya's Ruto</title>
      <description>The International Criminal Court tells Kenya's deputy president he must attend most of his trial, overturning an earlier decision.</description>

      <body>The International Criminal Court has told Kenya's Deputy President William Ruto he must attend most of his trial on charges of crimes against humanity. Prosecutors had appealed against an earlier decision which would have let him spend most of his time in Kenya. While he must appear at most of his trial, the court ruled he can be excused on a "case by case" basis. Mr Ruto's lawyers argued he was needed in Kenya after the attack by Islamist militants on the Westgate centre. He denies responsibility for post-election violence in 2007 and 2008. An estimated 1,200 people were killed in the ethnic bloodshed and about 600,000 fled their homes. His lawyers argued that justice could be met in his absence. At least 67 people were killed when militants believed to be from the Somali al-Shabab group stormed the shopping centre last month. In their ruling on Friday, judges were critical of the initial decision to give the deputy president a "blanket excusal" before the trial had even commenced. He will be allowed to apply to miss portions of the case but his absence will only be allowed when it is absolutely necessary. The BBC's Anna Holligan in The Hague says that the ruling reinforces the power of the ICC to hold the most powerful to account. However, Friday's ruling could deepen tensions between the court and African leaders who accuse it of unfairly targeting their continent, correspondents say. Mr Ruto has, so far, attended much of his case. Friday's judgement could also affect the trial of Kenyan President Uhuru, whose trial on similar charges is scheduled to start next month. The prosecution is still considering whether to appeal against a decision to allow the president to miss parts of his trial. Mr Kenyatta argued that attending the trial in The Hague would prevent him from governing the country. Our correspondent says that Mr Ruto, Mr Kenyatta and journalist Joshua Sang comprise the "Big Three" accused of instigating and co-ordinating the post-election killings in which innocent people including women and children were shot and hacked to death. But our correspondent says that was six years ago, and today Kenya is on the frontline of the battle against the global threat posed by al-Qaeda and its global affiliates. Mr Ruto's trial began in September. The deputy president is the first serving government official to stand trial in an international court. Many experts in international law believe that his case reflects the apparently incompatible demands of historical restorative justice versus future global security. Experts believe that the ICC is in an impossible position, fighting against the tide of international pressure to placate the government in Nairobi. </body>

      <title>Al-Shabab commander 'had time in UK'</title>
      <description>A senior Islamist militant who was the target of a recent abortive US special forces raid in Somalia had spent time in the UK, his friends tell the BBC.</description>

      <body>An al-Shabab commander who was the target of a recent abortive US special forces raid in Somalia had spent time in the UK, the BBC has learned. Abdukadir Mohamed Abdukadir, widely known as Ikrima, has been linked to alleged terror plots in Kenya. Friends have told the BBC that he came to the UK in 2007 and spent time in London, before moving to Somalia the following year. US Navy Seals failed in an attempt to capture him on 5 October. The raid followed an attack on the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi, Kenya, on 21 September that lasted four days and left at least 67 people dead. Al-Shabab has claimed responsibility for the siege. The BBC's East Africa correspondent Gabriel Gatehouse said it was not clear what role, if any, Ikrima had played in that attack. He is thought to be a recruiter of foreign fighters, and a key link between al-Shabab in Somalia, and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based in Yemen, our correspondent added. In 2004 he travelled to Norway, where he unsuccessfully sought asylum. The BBC has discovered that in early 2007 he came to Britain and spent time in London, before moving back to Somalia. Leaked Kenyan intelligence documents have linked him to Samantha Lewthwaite - the British widow of one of the 7/7 suicide attackers on the London transport system in 2005. An alleged plot to bomb targets in Kenya was foiled, police say, when they raided a number of addresses in Mombasa in December 2011. Ms Lewthwaite slipped away, her whereabouts are unknown. Our correspondent said the Kenyan authorities believe apprehending Ms Lewthwaite and Ikrima could help prevent future attacks similar to the one at Westgate. Meanwhile, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon has said an extra 4,500 troops are needed by the UN-backed African Union force (Amisom) fighting al-Shabab in Somalia. Mr Ban said in a report to the UN Security Council that recent military advances against al-Shabab could be reversed and there was a danger of more Westgate-style attacks if the 18,000-strong force was not bolstered. Al-Shabab said it had staged the attack on Westgate in response to Kenya's army joining Amisom and carrying out operations on Somali territory. The UN chief said that in addition to a troop surge, which would have to be paid for by richer UN member states, the African force also needed military attack helicopters. He appealed to both African and non-African countries to supply these. The BBC's international development correspondent Mark Doyle said the African Union had requested a boost of more than 6,000 troops, so concern had been expressed by African diplomats at the lower figure recommended by Mr Ban. In the past two years, Amisom has made significant advances against al-Shabab, pushing their main armed units out of several cities including the capital, Mogadishu, and the key southern port of Kismayo. But the militants still control many smaller towns and large rural areas of southern Somalia. </body>

      <title>China court rejects Bo Xilai appeal</title>
      <description>A high court in China has rejected the appeal of top politician Bo Xilai, jailed for life for bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power.</description>

      <body>A Chinese court has rejected the appeal of former politician Bo Xilai and upheld his life sentence for bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power. The former Chongqing Communist Party leader was convicted of the charges in September. He was removed from office in 2012 amid a scandal which saw his wife convicted of a British businessman's murder. The high court in Shandong, the province where Bo's trial was held, accepted his appeal earlier this month. "The facts of the first instance verdict are clear, the evidence is reliable, sufficient and the sentence is appropriate," the high court said in its ruling, which was posted on its website. "The court rules as follows: reject the appeal, uphold the original verdict. This verdict is the final ruling." The hearing appeared to have been brief, with the verdict coming about an hour after a convoy believed to be carrying Bo was seen arriving at the court. Footage from state broadcaster CCTV showed Bo's elder son, Li Wangzhi, in court with other relatives. Bo only receives one chance to appeal and his sentence is now final. He could submit a complaint to the Supreme People's Court in Beijing, but the vast majority of such complaints are rejected and do not result in another trial, reports the BBC's Celia Hatton in Beijing. Correspondents said few expected Bo's conviction to be overturned. The courts are controlled by the ruling Communist Party, from which Bo was expelled from last year. Bo Xilai, the charismatic former party chief in the city of Chongqing in south-western China, was a member of the powerful politburo - one of the 25 most senior party officials in the country. But he was removed from office last year amid a scandal which began when his deputy, Wang Lijun, sought refuge in the US consulate in Chengdu. The incident prompted an investigation into the death of British businessman Neil Heywood. Bo Xilai's wife, Gu Kailai, was eventually convicted of Mr Heywood's murder - a crime caused, the court said, by a financial dispute. Wang was also jailed for 15 years for helping Gu cover up the murder. Bo himself was found guilty of taking bribes amounting to 20m yuan ($3.3m, £2m) either personally or through his family. He was also accused of abusing his office by using his position to cover up for his wife's crime. Bo's supporters, however, believe he is the victim of a political purge. His downfall came as China prepared for its once-in-a-decade leadership transfer, as one generation of leaders made way for the next. Bo had been seen as a candidate for the very top, until his fall from grace. It was the biggest political shake-up to hit China's ruling elite in decades. The final verdict in the Bo case comes weeks before the Communist Party holds a major meeting in November to set economic policy. </body>

      <title>North Korea returns six S Koreans</title>
      <description>North Korea returns six South Korean men, aged between 27 and 67, to their homeland, South Korean officials say, in a rare handover.</description>

      <body>North Korea has returned six South Korean men to their homeland, South Korean officials say, in a rare move. The men, between the ages of 27 and 67, were handed over on Friday at the truce village of Panmunjom, on the border between the two countries. Their names were not released and details surrounding their detention in the North remain unclear. The two Koreas remain technically at war, as the 1950-53 conflict ended in an armistice and not a peace treaty. Pyongyang's Red Cross informed Seoul that the men would be handed back via Panmunjom on Thursday, a statement from South Korea's Unification Ministry said. Officials said the group would be taken to South Korea's spy agency to face questions over their presence in North Korea. The South Korean government said that at first glance, the men were not on the list of those abducted by the North. One possibility is that they may have crossed into North Korea illegally from China, the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul says. Unofficial travel to North Korea by private citizens from South Korea is illegal, Pyongyang's state news agency announced the detention of several unnamed South Korean nationals in 2010 and there is speculation that they may be among those returned, our correspondent adds. The move by North Korea is seen as a gesture of reconciliation following the cancellation of reunions for families split by the division of the Korean peninsula at the end of the Korean War which were planned for last month. Tensions between the two Koreas rose earlier this year, after North Korea's third nuclear test in February. </body>

      <title>Women gain as gender gap 'narrows'</title>
      <description>The gender gap is narrowing across the world, a World Economic Forum report suggests, with Nordic countries leading the way but Arab nations lagging behind.</description>

      <body>The gap between men and women has narrowed slightly in the past year in most countries, according to a World Economic Forum (WEF) report. Iceland, Finland and Norway top the list of 136 nations, based on political participation, economic equality and rights like education and health. The Middle East and North Africa were the only regions not to improve in the past year, with Yemen at the bottom. The Philippines and Nicaragua both feature in the top 10. The WEF has produced the report annually for the past eight years. The release of this year's edition comes as the BBC rounds off a month-long focus on women and gender around the world with a major event at Broadcasting House in London. One hundred women from all around the world are gathering for a day of debate and discussion as the 100 Women season comes to an end. Iceland's position at the top of the WEF rankings was the fifth year in a row the country has been named the world's most equal. Report founder and co-author Saadia Zahidi told the BBC that since the WEF began compiling the index in 2006, 80% of countries had made progress. "What's worrying though is that 20% of countries have made no progress or are falling behind," she said. She singled out the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia as countries that had invested in education and health, but had not integrated women into the economy. Nadia al-Sakkaf, editor of the English-language Yemen Times, in London for the 100 Women conference, told the BBC that she had stopped counting the years her country had languished at the bottom of the equality list. "It comes down to everyday life. We had three women running for president in 2006. We have lots of women in senior positions," she said. "But our levels of maternal mortality are very high, and 35% of girls aged 6-14 years old are not in school." Human capital Saadia Zahidi of the WEF said that by contrast many sub-Saharan countries had not invested in women, but through necessity they played a major role in the economy. Nordic countries continued to lead the way because they had a long history of investing in people, she said. "They are small economies with small populations; they recognise that talent matters, and that talent has to be men and women. Overall, the report, entitled Global Gender Gap Report 2013, found Iceland to be the most advanced country in the world in terms of gender equality for the fifth year running. Iceland, Finland (second), Norway (third) and Sweden (fourth) had all closed over 80% of the gender gap, where 100% would represent full equality. The highest-ranked Asian nation was the Philippines (fifth), praised for its success in health, education and economic participation. Asia's major economies performed poorly, with China in 69th place and Japan 105th. Nicaragua in 10th place was the highest positioned country in North and South America, and was praised for a "strong performance" in terms of political empowerment. Among major world economies Germany ranked 14th (down one), the UK held its position at 18, with Canada at 20 and the United States 23rd. On matters of health and survival, the report finds that 96% of the gap has now closed. In terms of education, the global gender gap is 93% closed, with 25 countries now judged to deliver equal treatment to boys and girls at school. It is a different picture on the core issue of economic equality, where the gender gap has closed by 60%. In developing and developed countries alike, women's presence in economic leadership positions is limited. And while women have made small gains in political representation - 2% this year - only 21% of that global gender gap has closed Ms Zahidi said the idea of the report was not to remind poor countries that they had fewer opportunities than rich countries, but to give them a tool to improve the situation. "Women make up one half of the human capital available to any economy and any company; if that talent isn't integrated, that is going to be a loss for both women and men," she said. </body>

      <title>Migrants rescued as EU leaders meet</title>
      <description>Italian authorities intercept some 800 migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean, as EU leaders meet in Brussels to discuss the problem.</description>

      <body>Italian authorities have intercepted some 800 migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean as EU leaders meet in Brussels to discuss the problem. Dozens of women and children were among more than 200 migrants on one boat found in difficulty 25 miles (40km) south of the island of Lampedusa. Two other boats were picked up further south of Lampedusa, one with nearly 100 Eritreans reportedly on board. Hundreds of migrants trying to reach Europe have drowned in recent weeks. Southern EU states including Italy and Malta have relaunched appeals for more support and resources, prompting the European Commission to call on EU countries to offer "additional and urgent contributions". The Commission is pressing for: However, national governments point out there are significant obstacles to some of these ambitions - including the lack of a stable government in Libya. National leaders are also conscious of strong resistance among many voters to further immigration. EU sources say the leaders are likely to promise improved co-operation, but not more money or resources. They say they first want to see a new surveillance effort, Eurosur, come into force, to see what effect that has. Maria Nicolini, the mayor of Lampedusa, the Italian island where many of the bodies have been brought ashore, was in Brussels on Thursday to lobby EU leaders. Many of the migrants who try to cross the Mediterranean come from developing countries afflicted by poverty and conflict, such as Syria and Eritrea. The UN special rapporteur on human rights in Eritrea said on Thursday that thousands Eritreans were fleeing their country every month, despite a "shoot-to-kill policy" targeting those attempting to leave. The envoy, Sheila Keetharuth, said Eritreans were subject to "the most serious human rights violations", including extra-judicial killings, torture and inhumane prison conditions. She said that according to UN figures, 7,504 Eritreans and 7,557 Syrians had arrived in Italy in the first nine months of the year. Boats, often operated by trafficking gangs, have been attempting the crossing to Europe for many years. But the issue was brought the fore earlier this month when more than 350 people - mostly Somalis and Eritreans - died after their boat sank off Lampedusa. </body>

      <body>At least one person has died and dozens more are injured in an explosion and fire that tore through a sweet factory in northern Mexico. A boiler is believed to have exploded in the Dulces Blueberry factory at an industrial park in Ciudad Juarez, causing the ceiling to collapse. About 300 people were said to be in the factory at the time and several are still unaccounted for. Fire crews and about 30 ambulances were at the scene. Ciudad Juarez Civil Protection Director Fernando Mota said firefighters found a body inside the factory and that six of the injured were in a serious condition. He said several workers were missing and could be trapped inside the building. "We're still searching the area to see if there are more dead," he added. Footage from the scene showed local people gathering outside, many of them in tears as they awaited news of friends or relatives. Paramedics were treating the injured, some of whom were badly burned. Ciudad Juarez is in the state of Chihuahua on the border with the US state of Texas. Factories such as the one affected, known as maquiladoras, are located in a free trade zone between the United States and Mexico. They are estimated to employ more than one million Mexicans. The BBC's Will Grant in Mexico City says maquiladoras are often criticised by labour rights groups for their low wages and poor working conditions, as they try to compete with China to manufacture cheap goods for the US market. </body>

      <title>Cuba to scrap two-currency system</title>

      <body>Cuba is to scrap its two-currency system in the latest financial reform rolled out by President Raul Castro, official media report. Since 1994 Cuba has had two currencies, one pegged to the US dollar and the other worth only a fraction of that. The more valuable convertible peso (CUC) was reserved for use in the tourism sector and foreign trade. Now its value will be gradually unified with the lower-value CUP, ending a system resented by ordinary Cubans. The Cuban economy is almost entirely state-run and the tourism sector has boomed since the collapse of the Soviet Union plunged Cuba into economic isolation and hardship. The two-currency system was supposed to protect Cuba's fragile economy but angered locals paid in the much lower-value CUP and denied access to goods only available for those with convertible pesos. The policy exacerbated the creation of a two-tier class system in Cuba which divided privileged Cubans with access to the lucrative tourist and foreign-trade sectors from those working in the local economy - all-too-visibly contradicting Cuba's supposedly egalitarian society. The council of ministers has approved a timetable for implementing "measures that will lead to monetary and exchange unification", the official Communist Party newspaper Granma said. Unification is "imperative to guarantee the re-establishment of the Cuban peso's value and its role as money, that is as a unit of accounting, means of payment and savings", it said. It gave no details of how quickly the change would be implemented, though Reuters news agency quoted Cuban economists as saying it would take about 18 months. </body>

      <title>Syria: Polio epidemic fears grow</title>
      <description>The number of suspected cases of polio among children in Syria is believed to have risen sharply, with at least 22 people now thought to be suffering from the disease, health officials say.</description>

      <body>At least 22 people - most of them babies and toddlers - are now believed to have contracted polio in Syria, the World Health Organization has reported. If confirmed, it would be the first outbreak of the disease there in 14 years. Syria's Health Ministry began an immunisation drive on Thursday. Before Syria's civil war began in 2011, some 95% of children were vaccinated against the disease. Now, Unicef estimates 500,000 children have not been immunised. WHO said the suspected outbreak centres on the eastern province of Deir Ezzor. "There is a cluster of 22 acute flaccid paralysis cases that is being investigated in that area," WHO spokesman Oliver Rosenbauer told Reuters news agency. "Everybody is treating this as an outbreak and is in outbreak response mode." Two cases have already been confirmed by laboratory tests while the WHO expects final laboratory confirmation on the remaining 20 cases next week. There are more than 100,000 children, all under age five, now at risk of polio in Deir Ezzor province alone, which has been caught in fierce battles between Syrian government forces and opposition fighters. The city of Deir Ezzor remains partially controlled by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, while the countryside is in the hands of the opposition. The WHO is now working with the UN, Syria's Health Ministry and other agencies on a mass immunisation programme. But it is expected to be a difficult undertaking, says the BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva, given the widespread insecurity and estimates that over half of Syria's medical professionals have left the country. More than four million Syrians have been displaced internally by the conflict and generally live in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. The WHO has already reported increases in cases of measles, typhoid and hepatitis A. Aid agencies are also developing emergency immunisation plans for Syrian refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Egypt. "Obviously, we're extremely worried about the situation," Simon Ingram, a spokesman for Unicef's operations in the Middle East, told the BBC. "People are flooding across borders in an uncontrolled manner and this increases the possibilities and means by which the virus can spread." The highly contagious disease is most often spread by consuming food or liquid contaminated with faeces. Polio has been largely eradicated in developed countries but remains endemic in Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Worldwide, polio cases have fallen from an estimated 350,000 at the start of a WHO-led immunisation campaign in 1988 to just 223 reported cases last year. There is no known cure, though a series of vaccinations can confer immunity. Young children are particularly susceptible to paralytic polio, the most serious form of the disease. </body>

      <body>At least four people have been killed in Tripoli, Lebanon, in fighting between supporters and opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Gunmen have been trading fire between the Sunni district of Bab al-Tabbana and the Alawite district of Jabal Muhsin since Monday. Dozens of people have been injured in the violence, officials say. The adjacent neighbourhoods have witnessed sporadic clashes since the Syrian conflict began in early 2011. President Assad is a member of the Alawite sect and is fighting a Sunni-led revolt. Tripoli, with a small Alawite community living in the midst of a Sunni majority, is seen as one of Lebanon's most volatile sectarian faultlines. A security official said the Lebanese army was "responding to all sources of fire", AFP news agency reported. "Snipers are hiding on the rooftops and in the streets," it quoted the unnamed official as saying. On-off fighting between the two districts have claimed scores of lives over the past two years. </body>

General Michael Hayden was talking off-the-record to journalists by phone when he was overheard by another passenger, a former political activist. Tom Matzzie said he waited half an hour before live-tweeting comments about US renditions and a "famous BlackBerry". The comments went viral on news websites and late-night television. Gen Hayden, who was alerted to the Twitter feed within about 15 minutes, then offered an interview to Mr Matzzie, who is now head of a company called Ethical Electric. "I just had a very nice conversation with Michael Hayden. He was a gentleman and we disagree," Mr Matzzie later tweeted. The two men were on a high-speed Acela train travelling from Washington, DC to New York late on Thursday afternoon. Mr Matzzie began tweeting details of the conversations from what he said was a distance of 8ft (about 2.4m) away. "On Acela listening to former NSA spy boss Michael Hayden give 'off record' interviews. I feel like I'm in the NSA. Except I'm in public," Mr Matzzie's Twitter feed read. The National Security Agency has come under intense criticism after revelations by ex-CIA contractor Edward Snowden that US intelligence conducted extensive web and phone surveillance on targets at home and abroad. Mr Snowden now faces espionage charges in the US and has been granted temporary asylum in Russia. Gen Hayden has defended his former agency's operations in the past and Mr Matzzie wrote that Thursday's interviews were also focused on NSA surveillance of foreign allies. As the former head of MoveOn.org Political Action, Mr Matzzie once campaigned against the US-led war in Iraq. He made clear his own feelings about the former NSA and CIA chief with a tweet reading, "There is a faint smell of sulfur on the train." He said Gen Hayden asked journalists to refer to him as a "former senior administration official" for comments described as "disparaging" to President Barack Obama's administration. Gen Hayden later gave a statement to the Reuters news agency saying he "didn't criticise" the president. "I actually said these are very difficult issues. I said I had political guidance, too, that limited the things that I did when I was director of NSA. Now that political guidance is going to be more robust. It wasn't a criticism," Gen Hayden said. </body>

      <title>Canada senator 'lied' in expense row</title>
      <description>Canadian Conservative Senator Marjory LeBreton accuses fellow Tory Senator Mike Duffy of lying in order to avoid punishment in a growing expenses row.</description>

      <body>A Canadian Conservative Party senator has accused another senator embroiled in an expenses row of lying in order to avoid political repercussions. Senator Marjory LeBreton says Mike Duffy spoke a "blatant falsehood". Mr Duffy, Pamela Wallin and Patrick Brazeau face suspension from the Senate without pay over accusations they claimed improper expenses. Mr Duffy has accused Conservative PM Stephen Harper's office of attempting to cover up the matter. On Thursday, Ms LeBreton spoke as the Senate debated motions to suspend Conservatives Mr Duffy, Ms Wallin and Mr Brazeau. "There is no joy in having this whole situation before us," she said, speaking in favour of the suspensions. Days earlier, Mr Duffy accused Mr Harper's office of wielding "bribery, threats and extortion" in an effort to cover up a growing expenses row. Mr Duffy said Mr Harper's office sought to force him to repay taxpayer-reimbursed expenses that Mr Duffy believed were properly claimed. Ms LeBreton challenged the allegation: "The story that Senator Duffy spun in this place is not based in facts and it certainly leaves open to question what he was talking about and what he was thinking." She said Mr Duffy spoke a "blatant falsehood" in order to avoid being expelled from the Senate over the expenses matter. On Wednesday, Mr Harper denied involvement in the affair, telling the House of Commons he had been unaware of Mr Duffy's activities. Canadian senators are appointed by the governor general of Canada - the Queen's representative - on the advice of the prime minister. They typically join either the government caucus or the opposition caucus, or sit as independents. Mr Duffy has been accused of seeking reimbursement for expenses associated with a cottage in his home province of Prince Edward Island despite actually residing primarily in Ottawa, the national capital. He has argued the expense claims were within government guidelines for the reimbursement of senators who live outside Ottawa but must maintain a second home there. Mr Duffy has said Mr Harper ordered him to repay the government after months of negative publicity. But he declined, arguing that to pay back money to which he was entitled would damage his reputation. He then accused Mr Harper's office of "bribery, threats and extortion", and said Mr Harper threatened to force him from his Senate seat in order to cover up the row. Mr Duffy's lawyer says the prime minister's office sought a way to repay the 90,000 Canadian dollars ($86,336; £53,292) it said Mr Duffy owed the taxpayers in order to put an end to the potentially damaging row. Mr Duffy reportedly agreed in order to avoid an audit. Mr Harper's chief of staff Nigel Wright said in May that he provided the money to Mr Duffy, prompting an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Mr Wright later resigned his post. "Any assertion that I was in any way consulted or had any knowledge of Mr Wright's payment to Mr Duffy is categorically false," Mr Harper later told the media. "Had I known about it, I would not have permitted it." Mr Duffy, Ms Wallin and Mr Brazeau have left the Conservative Senate caucus after audits uncovered what officials labelled "troubling" expenses claims. The government leader in the Senate Claude Carignan later recommended that the three be suspended, saying the move was needed "to protect the dignity and reputation of the Senate". While Ms LeBreton spoke in favour of the suspension, Conservative Senator Donald Plett defended his three colleagues, arguing the punishment would set a precedent enabling the Senate to punish merely unpopular members. Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau, meanwhile, has sought to pin the row on Mr Harper. "A leader takes responsibility when things go wrong and this prime minister has consistently avoided taking any responsibility for this sordid mess," Mr Trudeau said. But the Liberal Party has also been touched by the expenses row. Ex-Liberal Senator Mac Harb left the chamber in August, dropping a dispute of an order that he repay 231,000 Canadian dollars ($220,000; £141,000) in expense reimbursements deemed improper. </body>

The rating means Iceland is the country where women enjoy the most equal access to education and healthcare. It is also where women are most likely to be able to participate fully in the country's political and economic life. Iceland is joined at the top of the The Global Gender Gap Report, 2013 by its Nordic neighbours Finland, Norway and Sweden. Overall, the gender gap narrowed slightly across the globe in 2013, as 86 of 133 countries showed improvements. However, "change is definitely slow", says one of the report's authors, Saadia Zahidi.

      <title>Corden on singing like Paul Potts</title>
      <description>James Corden on becoming Paul Potts</description>

      <body>James Corden talks about bringing Britain's Got Talent winner Paul Potts to the big screen, singing with Keira Knightley and his admiration for Meryl Streep. Corden admits he had his doubts about playing talent show contestant-turned-opera singer Potts in his new film One Chance. "I think my reaction was the same as everyone else's when they hear there's a Paul Potts film," laughs Corden. "I was like 'Really? Are you sure this is a good idea?" But after director David Frankel, of The Devil Wears Prada fame, convinced him the film would focus on the build-up to that famous audition - Potts' journey from a bullied, opera-obsessed young boy to a YouTube sensation - he was in. "It's a sports movie basically, where the sport is... opera," says Corden. Potts was a mobile-phone salesman when he entered and won the first series of reality show Britain's Got Talent in 2007, and the film uses footage of judges Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden and Piers Morgan's genuine reactions to that "watercooler moment". It also boasts British talent such as Julie Walters and Colm Meaney as Paul's parents, MacKenzie Crook as his friend (and manager in Carphone Warehouse) and Alexandra Roach as his love interest. Corden had to practise wearing his clip-in fake "Paul Potts teeth" for six weeks to conquer any lisping - Potts famously got his fixed with his BGT prize money - but they were "tremendously useful" for getting into character. Pulling off Potts' operatic singing voice proved a bit more challenging. "When I said yes to the film I was a little bit bullish and thought, 'I can do this'," reveals Corden. "So they got me some singing lessons with this brilliant teacher in New York. After about eight or nine lessons some producers came down to hear my opera. "I got about a third of the way through Nessun Dorma and they just went, 'Yeah we're going to get someone else to do this'. It wasn't great." So Corden sang "with the micrrophone turned off" during filming, "and then Paul sort of synched to my lips really". "We were all a little bit worried - will it work, will they buy it?" admits Corden. "Actually you kind of do." The film is backed by Hollywood heavyweight producer Harvey Weinstein, who Corden is said to have impressed while on stage in last year's hit play One Man, Two Guvnors. But he's quick to rubbish internet rumours that Weinstein will be running any sort of Oscar campaign for him. "For this?" he laughs. "I would be very surprised, I can't imagine that will be anywhere close to the case. "We've made a really nice, light, humorous film and I'm immensely proud of it, but I think you can start to get ever so slightly carried away with those sorts of things and I'm definitely not, in any way." It must be hard for Corden to keep his feet on the ground though, when he is currently turning up to work at Shepperton Studios with the likes of Johnny Depp and Meryl Streep. Nine director Rob Marshall has cast him in "a dream of a role", as The Baker in a big-budget film version of Broadway musical Into the Woods. "It's certainly the biggest thing I've ever done. It's ridiculous, I spent a long time just waiting to be fired really," says Corden. "I thought someone would go, 'This is silly, we should get someone who's actually famous'." But he's still in the job, along with Chris Pine, Anna Kendrick and Emily Blunt. However it is Streep who has really impressed him. "I would be a robot if it didn't affect me, I think she's probably the greatest actress alive," he says enthusiastically. "But (the reason) she's so incredible, is that she's just so unbelievably welcoming and encouraging and puts you at ease. (She is) a team player, she encourages a company spirit. I genuinely can't speak highly enough about her." Having misspent some of his youth in various, slightly dubious boybands, Corden can actually hold a tune. He'll be doing so in Into the Woods and alongside Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo in another film, Can a Song Save Your Life?, due out next year. "I play Keira's old friend from home who's a struggling musician in New York. I sing, but I'm not - there's a pattern emerging here - I sing but I'm not very good," he laughs. "Keira's really got the best songs in it - her voice is unbelievable, genuinely. People are going to be so shocked when they hear it. I think it's her best performance. "It's written and directed by John Carney who made the film Once, which I'm a huge fan of. I'm very proud to be in it," says Corden. In fact, these days Corden seems rightly proud of all his work. With flops like Lesbian Vampire Killers and his ill-fated sketch show Horne and Corden better left out of it, he currently has his fingers in many successful pies. New BBC Two comedy The Wrong Mans is a return to form for the Gavin and Stacey co-creator - currently enjoying positive viewing figures and favourable reviews. And co-written with Mathew Baynton, it gives him the chance to do what he likes best: "Being at the seed of an idea, and writing it and shooting it and editing it seeing it through. That is probably where I'm probably most creatively fulfilled." There's also hosting Sky One sports quiz A League of Their Own, and another year of the Brit Awards in 2014 before he hands hosting duties over to "someone younger and better looking". His plans to return to the stage - "I think in 2015" - sound like they've been mapped out with precision, but Corden denies that is the case. "I've never really had a career plan, which I'm sure won't come as a shock to anyone," he says. "Mainly my plan is to have fun and enjoy it. I couldn't think of anything worse than not enjoying it really." </body>

      <description>Meeting the faces behind technology's most iconic voices</description>

      <body>Millions of people hear their voices every day - but would you recognise them if you saw them walking down the street? Well maybe now you will. The BBC met the faces behind four of the most famous and iconic voices heard in technology today. Siri, Apple's voice-powered personal assistant, made its debut in June 2010. Since then, millions of the devices with the feature have been sold worldwide. In the UK, the voice you will hear responding to commands belongs to Jon Briggs, an illustrious voiceover artist whose portfolio includes the likes of the Weakest Link, Radio 2 and Channel 4. Jon had offered up his voice to a firm that specialises in computer-generated speech - that is, taking Jon's voice but moulding it to say virtually any possible phrase. Apple, when creating Siri, picked out Jon - unbeknownst to him. "I discovered that I was being used as the voice of Siri when Rory Cellan-Jones, the BBC technology correspondent, suddenly started demonstrating it on BBC Breakfast. "I thought 'I recognise that voice!', and so it was true - and it's a slightly bizarre journey since then." It means that while his voice is now being played out countless times a day all over the country, Apple has not paid him - he only received the fee earned he when recording the original material. But, he says he's excited to be "in early" on what he believes is changing how we use technology. "You can take a photograph of your desk - there is a screen a keyboard and a mouse. "You will show it to your children or your grandchildren and they will laugh and go 'you had a thing called a mouse? What's that funny thing with letters on?'" In contrast to the received pronunciation of her "Tube" voice, Emma Clarke's speaking voice is in fact Northern - growing up, as she did, in Sale near Manchester. Her voice can be heard across the Bakerloo, Central and District lines of London's iconic Underground network. The process of getting the job was long and painstaking - months of focus groups and whittling down possible candidates. During the selection, each possible voice was given a codename. Emma's, apparently, was 'Marilyn'. "Had they named me 'Brenda' I'm not sure I'd have got the gig," she jokes. She now gets fan mail from all over the world, particularly from Texas. "People initially thought I was actually on the train!" she says, "Or in some kind of central control room. I don't know where they thought it was." She says she is proud to lend her voice to the network, but adds that she hopes some of the lines she recorded never have to be heard by the public. "There were a couple of emergency announcements, that I remember when I read them on the script I thought 'oh god, imagine how these people will feel when they hear these announcements. "I felt such a sense of responsibility, of calming people down." Unlike the other voices in this piece, Terry Green is the only one who doesn't consider his voice to be his profession. He found his way to audio fame indirectly. He specialises in customer service, and the systems used in shops to get things moving and punters through the tills. And so it was, when the company he was working for needed a male voice to beckon people to the till, he stepped forward: "Cashier number three, please..." "We just sat down with a digital voice recorder, laid down the track, and that was it! I was on the prototype system, and then suddenly rolled out to 8,000 shops." They recorded up to cashier number 25 - but now the system goes much further. Indeed, around the world, the company's technology is used in thousands of stores - although with local voices instead of Terry's. Now he makes his living as a leading expert on the study of shoppers' behaviour. "My voice was on all these systems that we were rolling out, so I was becoming more and better known. I started writing white papers, and eventually I came to write a book." One morning, Sara Mendes da Costa was listening to Terry Wogan on Radio 2 when he mentioned that a competition would be held to find the new voice of the Speaking Clock. "A little bell rang in my head and I went 'oooh!'" She wasn't alone - within moments she had had calls friends and family saying she should put herself forward. She won, and from 2007 she took over the voice of the Speaking Clock, which is called up approximately 60 million times each year. It was a job she was excited, but nervous, to take on. "Brian Cobby, who sadly passed away last year, had the most beautiful, rich, Shakespearian voice. "Then I came along - I have visions of people going 'oh...'!" "But they wanted something different, someone a bit more of the moment, a little bit more who we are now." Sara uses the Speaking Clock regularly in her day-to-day work, and admits she just can't resist listening to each and every word. "I listen until when it goes through to 'precisely' - and only then I can hang up! "It's just a weird thing that I've got." Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <body>A new mobile phone concept that would give users a chance to choose from a range of components, and replace or upgrade them when necessary, has generated enormous interest online. But could this sustainable, modular device ever become a reality? Six months ago, the Dutch designer Dave Hakkens took apart his favourite camera. "I noticed all these little parts," he says. "And everything was good except for the lens motor. That had broken." But when Hakkens contacted the manufacturer to get a replacement motor, he was advised to just replace the whole camera. "With your bike you repair the tyre, you don't throw the bike away," he says. "But for some reason this is what we do with electronics." Hakkens realised that if a device could be taken apart and upgraded more easily it would last much longer, minimising electrical waste. And so the idea of Phonebloks was born. The concept - Hakkens hasn't figured out how to actually make it - is for a phone with a replaceable screen and easily moveable, changeable "bloks", each containing a different element such as battery, chipset, gyroscope and so on. In the video Hakkens made to publicise Phonebloks, the bits fall into place on the backplate of the phone like pieces of Lego. The bloks vary in size and can be made to tessellate in any number of combinations. "Let's say this is your phone and you do everything in the cloud - why not replace your storage blok with a bigger battery blok?" asks the voiceover. "If you're like this guy and love to take pictures, why not upgrade your camera?" Last month, Hakkens set about showing off Phonebloks using the "crowd speaking" platform Thunderclap. Users donate their social reach to a project they support, allowing the site to commandeer their Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook accounts to broadcast a message at a single, predetermined moment. Hakkens was aiming for 500 people to sign up to his Thunderclap, but the Phonebloks video went viral, gaining seven million views in three days. He has now amassed 950,000 Thunderclap supporters and on Tuesday the Phonebloks video will ping across social networks 375 million times. "It comes down to a consumer signal," says Kyle Wiens, the founder of iFixit.com, a repository for user-generated repair manuals to the latest gadgets. "The market needs to indicate to manufacturers that we care about modular, repairable hardware." Phones have never been as modular as computers, but Wiens says they used to be sturdier and more repairable. Take batteries. Until the iPhone came along in 2007, batteries on all handsets could be readily removed. With every new phone the power source is a little bit harder to get to, stuck down with more glue, or tucked away in a case that's more impregnable. To get the battery out of the HTC One, the geeks at iFixit had to mangle the phone's casing and remove the motherboard. "I wish batteries were more replaceable than they are," says Bruce Harvey, an electrical engineer at Florida State University. "The reason they're not is in order to make the phone so small, the battery's shape is conformed to fit in there, rather than be a square block [like Phonebloks]." It is consumer preference for a small phone that has pushed manufacturers to hide their batteries away. In the same way, our craving for ever-slimmer, speedier phones has led them to pile hardware - such as the central processor, memory and wifi - on to the same chip, not separate them out into blocks. Harvey believes that Phonebloks is a technical challenge but an achievable one. The bloks could talk to one another if they were all designed to work with the same signalling system. However, he says the real difficulty would be in making a modular phone robust enough to survive the "harsh environment" of the trouser pocket. Each component would have to be encased in a material such as plastic, adding thickness and making the device less sexy. "It's one of those things where if people look at it they say, 'Wow, I can be more ecologically sound, I get upgrades when I want to…'" he says. "Then someone shows them that their phone's going to be six-tenths of an inch (1.5cm) thick or something like that. Reality will meet up with hopes and dreams." The challenge of marketing a modular system doesn't end with the chubbiness problem. "We sadly live in a disposable society and people do have an expectation that they will change their phone every so often," says Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight (and proud owner of more than 800 handsets going back two decades). How long people hang on to a handset varies across the world. On average it's just over three years, but in the US it's just 20 months. Although new devices are almost always bought on a contract, people have come to regard their new phone as a "free upgrade". Lots of us wait impatiently for upgrade day - phone technology is advancing so fast that multiple components, though still functional, feel outdated after a couple of years. However, this trend may not continue indefinitely, Wood says. Mobile phones could be approaching an "innovation plateau" where the basics like speed and screen resolution are as good as they can get. Add to this the regular software "drops" that make our phones feel like new, and people might start hanging on to their handsets for longer. In this kind of market, Phonebloks might become viable, Wood argues. Home computers reached an innovation plateau some years ago, but while we replace our computers less frequently than we used to, not many of us exploit the modular nature of our PCs and upgrade the modules. However, in Hakkens's view that's because it isn't easy enough - only "die-hard geeks" are willing to reach for a screwdriver to unscrew their memory or motherboard. Price is arguably the least important factor in the mobile phone market, but it may represent another challenge for Phonebloks. In the long run, you might think consumers would save money with a modular system that can be continually upgraded and never needs chucking out, but this may not be the case. Big phone companies achieve enormous efficiencies of scale by negotiating special rates with parts manufacturers, buying up production capacity for months at a time. In return, the parts manufacturers get investment for research and development and a guarantee of future business. The idea of marketing "bloks" to end-consumers through a "blokstore" might not be so appealing to these companies, which might in turn prevent similar economies of scale being achieved. Hakkens recognises that neither the big phone companies nor the manufacturers that work with them are likely to jump at his idea - he sees it as a chance for other electronics companies to enter the fray. He says he has been approached by a number of companies and individuals excited about getting involved. "Right now, I'm thinking about what would be the best next step," he says. "Would it be to build it myself, open-source, online - or partner up with companies and collaborators?" He seems to have been caught off guard by the attention his little idea is receiving. "I wasn't planning to do a next step," he admits, "but now I have all these people offering help." Kyle Wiens and Ben Wood are enthusiastic about Phonebloks, but they both believe the concept might end in a half-way house - a phone in which the battery and screen, and possibly the memory and camera, can be easily replaced. For Wiens, the key to making a green phone is different - a design durable enough for the device to reach a second-hand market. "The whole phone doesn't need to be modular so long as it can be repaired and kept in service," he says. Dave Hakkens doesn't pretend to have all the answers, or even certainty that Phonebloks will see the light of day. "Half of the world says it's possible, the other half says it's not possible," he says. "I don't think anyone really knows because no-one's really tried it. So that's the next thing to do - just figure it out." Dave Hakkens spoke to Click on the BBC World Service - listen again to the programme on iPlayer or get the Click podcast.

      <body>A year after the first case of ash dieback in mature woodland - and with the disease spreading inexorably - experts are looking at ways to future-proof forests. Stroll around the Woodland Trust's Hucking estate (pictured in satellite views, above) near Maidstone in Kent and you could be forgiven for thinking little has changed in centuries. Sheep graze on the swathes of grassland between the gentle chalk hills. Pockets of ancient woodland carpet the hilltops and valleys. In reality, however, this seemingly timeless rural landscape is in constant flux and the effects of ash dieback will soon be all too apparent. Trees on the estate show the hallmarks of the disease in the black, shrivelled leaves hanging from the branches of diminutive seedlings and the magnificent ash trees that tower above. Ash dieback is spreading fast in this Area of Outstanding Beauty known as the Kent Downs, with trees bearing the scars of the chalara fungus. "See that lovely big ash up there," says site manager Clive Steward, pointing out a huge tree in a patch of ancient woodland. "Underneath it - see the big wide leaves - that's sycamore. It's just waiting to take over really. Because that's what will happen." Nature is poised to fill in the gaps if - as experts predict - millions of native ash trees die. Britain's forests have been through much turmoil in modern times, from the harvesting of timber for the shipbuilding industry to the arrival of pathogens such as Dutch elm disease in the 1970s. But the current speed of change is alarming ecologists. They say trees are facing unprecedented threats, with a recent increase in findings of new pests and diseases. Many believe it is only a matter of time before threats such as the emerald ash borer beetle, which drills into the trunks of ash trees, reach our shores. In an age of global trade and travel, rather than trying to stop these invaders, the key to safeguarding forests could be to closely manage them - and plant them to be resilient to future threats, be they a new pest, a violent storm, or climate change. Austin Brady of woodland conservation charity the Woodland Trust says to give a wood resilience a range of native species need to be planted, so if a pathogen strikes, at least some of the trees will survive. "For future healthy forests we need forests to have a wider range of native species growing there, so that all our eggs aren't in one basket," says Mr Brady. "So that if a particular pest and disease or issue comes along it won't destroy the whole forest. It might take out some of the components but there'll be enough different species of trees in there for the forest to survive." Maintaining diversity in the age of trees is also important, he says, as is maintaining connections between woods to give wildlife the space to thrive. The Hucking estate is seen as a pioneer of the idea of resilient woodland. A few decades ago, before the estate was taken over by the Woodland Trust, much of it was arable farmland, dotted with patches of ancient woodland. Careful management and planning has restored the natural landscape, with new trees planted to create corridors of habitat for animals and birds to roam. A mixture of native trees were used, which stand a better chance of withstanding tree diseases that are moving around the world. Mr Brady sees the practice as trying to "mimic nature". But some believe management in this way is artificial, and that nature will find its own level. Naturalist and writer Richard Mabey argues catastrophes like tree diseases are natural events, from which woods will recover without intervention. "Woody vegetation responds, adapts, regroups," he wrote in the New Statesmen. "What emerges in its recovery stage may not be the same as before, but it will always be a vital, dynamic, arboreal community. The same process will happen with ash, perhaps more quickly than we think." Joan Weber of Forest Research, agrees that "nature will fill in the gaps," as it did when elms disappeared, but this is more difficult when one particular species is dominant in a woodland. Austin Brady, however, says Britain's countryside has lost the great, untamed forests still present in countries such as Poland, with a corresponding loss of diversity. "You could make an argument for saying, let's leave forests to nature," he says. "The trouble is - we stopped leaving forests to nature in this country about 2,000 years ago. So we can't suddenly now say let's leave them to nature... we've taken away all the support systems that nature would have had in place." Others question exactly what resilience means. Managing a wood land to guard against the effects of tree diseases will not necessarily help other wildlife in the area, says Ray Dawes of the National Trust . "If you are going to change the tree species you are going to change the wildlife," says Mr Dawes, who believes the prescription for a healthy woodland varies. The National Trust has 400 properties with significant amounts of woodland in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and they are all different. "It's looking at individual woods - their origins, their values and the threats to them," he says. Back at the Hucking estate, Clive Steward spreads out an ordnance survey map over the bonnet of his dusty estate car to point out lanes in the Sussex and Kent weald that were carved by ancient farmers running pigs through the forests. Ash trees have left their mark on the map, recorded in names like Ashford and Asholt Wood. Local conservationists are preparing to record the impact of the ash tree on the landscape from a cultural perspective, in case it is lost. Nick Johannsen, director of the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, grew up during the era of Dutch elm disease, and remembers it well. "It's going to be a longer, slower, more lingering loss than elm was," he says. "But already beautiful ash trees are a shadow of themselves." Ash has long been part of our heritage, he says, used for the framework of early aircraft such as the De Havilland Mosquito, and tennis racquets at Wimbledon. "Not only is it extraordinary in its landscape and its wildlife importance - its natural heritage - it's also part of the cultural heritage of Britain. That's what we want to celebrate - because we are losing ash trees." </body>

      <body>There's been a wave of popularity for drinks like the Aperol spritz, the Negroni, and a host of cocktails flavoured with "bitters". Why are people turning their backs on sweet cocktails in favour of a bitter taste? The last two decades have seen an extraordinary resurgence in cocktail-making on both sides of the Atlantic, with everything from Cointreau-sweetened Cosmopolitans to sugary Mojitos being drunk in vast quantities. But there is now a definite trend towards bitter drinks. People are ordering whisky or gin-based drinks paired with vermouths. And there is growing interest in the US, UK and other European nations in Italian amari. These complex, herbal, bittersweet drinks, with names like Averna, Ramazzotti, Montenegro and Fernet Branca, are usually consumed as aperitivi or digestivi - drinks thought to either encourage the appetite before dinner or help with digestion afterwards. Their bitter mixer cousins, Cynar, Campari and Aperol, are increasingly being used in cocktails. Aperol - based on bitter orange and rhubarb and containing classic bitter ingredients like gentian and cinchona (a source of quinine) - has rocketed in popularity in recent years following a push by owner Gruppo Campari. Sales rose 156% in the UK in 2012 and 56% in the US. This year's figures, announced soon, are expected to be even bigger. A poster campaign in the UK encourages people to try an Aperol spritz - prosecco sparkling wine and soda water mixed with Aperol. A fundamental point of the spritz is its low alcohol content. Aperol's slogan is "poco alcolico", roughly meaning a little bit alcoholic. "I think the Aperol spritz was probably the most asked-for drink in the outdoor areas of most decent bars in London this summer," says World Duty Free mixologist Charlie McCarthy. Laura Tallo, from Nonna's Italian Cucina in Bath, says many British drinkers have returned after holidays in Italy, having seen certain drinks paired with tavola calda - the selection of hot, freshly-baked food. "People are definitely beginning to embrace the Italian custom of drinking aperitifs. We have seen a definite trend emerging of people choosing classic Italian pre-dinner drinks such as an Aperol spritz, Negroni [equal parts Campari, gin and sweet vermouth], Americano or Martini," she says. Such drinks are not to everyone's taste, of course. While many Italians have been brought up around the tradition of amari, they can baffle non-Italian palates at first taste. "They say of a Negroni the first two or three sips you despise, and after you have had two or three drinks you start to like it," says Tom Ross, bars manager of the Polpo restaurant group in London. The taste of Fernet Branca - vaguely minty but with pungent undertones of cough medicine - is so powerful that comedian Bill Cosby constructed a seven-minute anecdote around his initial horror on encountering the drink in Italy. And yet Fernet is loved by many, being drunk with cola in Argentina and - accompanied by a separate shot of ginger beer - known as the "bartender's handshake" in San Francisco. One of the first recorded definitions of a cocktail was in a New York journal in 1803, which classified it as a mixture of any "spirituous liquor", with water, sugar and "bitters", known at the time as a bittered sling. You can find the descendant of these traditional bitters (with the term typically referring to both singular and plural) in any decent bar in the UK or US. There'll be a rather unusual bottle among the others - small with a yellow top and an oversized label covered in small print. It is the world's most famous cocktail bitters, Angostura. This bitters is the key ingredient in pink gin, the traditional officers' cocktail in the Royal Navy. It's also the bedrock of famous cocktails, including the Old Fashioned, beloved of Mad Men's Don Draper, and the Manhattan. A supply shortage in 2009 caused panic throughout the world's bartending community, according to McCarthy, and prompted bartenders to start making their own. The current wave of speakeasy-type bars inspired by the prohibition years in the US, has prompted interest in traditional and hitherto forgotten cocktails. This in turn has prompted demand for more unusual bitters. Bob Petrie, of Bob's Bitters, started in 2005 when he was approached by the Dorchester Hotel to create a range. Traditional bitters are very complex, with aromatic flavours brought out from a combination of barks, roots, herbs, and spices by macerating them in alcohol. He looked at pairing them with the "botanicals" in gin, and came up with a range including cardamom, chocolate, coriander, ginger, grapefruit, lavender, liquorice, orange and mandarin, peppermint and vanilla. "Single flavours are a lot easier for the barman as it gives a lot more scope," Petrie says. "What they can do with mine is mix and match." Rochdale-born US celebrity mixologist Gary Regan is another who was prompted to make his own to replicate the orange bitters in some old cocktail recipes. "When I realised it was hard to get good ones I decided to make my own. I stole a recipe from the Gentleman's Companion of 1939. I had about four different trials and eventually got something I liked. "This shift towards bitter has been going on for eight years," Regan estimates. "[But] most bitters aren't that bitter. They taste herbal. In fact, they are a bit on the sweet side sometimes." Fee Brothers in Rochester, New York, has been making bitters since 1863, with a short break for prohibition. Joe and Ellen Fee are the fourth generation. Their 92-year-old father still regularly visits the plant. Joe Fee says there has been a marked increase in sales over the past seven years. "Just about anything can be made into a bitters. They are your spice rack behind the bar." "I am the Willy Wonka of the cocktail mixers," boasts Ellen Fee, who conjures up the new flavours. "I like to think in terms of what flavour is already bitter. Cocoa powder is bitter, cranberry is bitter. You add to that and make it more interesting." The plethora of these cocktail tinctures and potions shows the tastes of aficionados have shifted. But there are other flagbearers for a more bitter palate. Many James Bond fans attempt to recreate the Vesper Martini from Casino Royale. Bond asks for it to be made with strong gin, vodka and the bitter Kina Lillet. Lillet took out much of the bitter quinine in the 1980s and fans tend to use Cocchi Americano Italian vermouth instead. And the Queen has followed in her mother's footsteps by drinking gin and Dubonnet - the quinine-bittered French aperitif. Just a few years ago, her choice was seen as unusual. Now she's part of an established trend. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <description>What is the point of government consultations?</description>

      <body>What is the point of government consultations? I pose the question at the end of a week in which ministers responded to three official consultations on three controversial proposals - and appeared to ignore the results from them all. On Monday, the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) published its response to a consultation on planned changes to the assessment of people with disabilities in determining their entitlement to benefits. The government had conducted the consultation, it said, "in a fully open-minded manner". Ministers had carefully considered all the views expressed. The consultation focused on plans limiting entitlement to extra help for mobility needs to those who cannot walk 20m. The overwhelming response was that this was a bad idea. "Respondents felt there was no evidence to support the use of 20m," the consultation reported, pointing out "that other government policies use 50m as a measure of mobility". In a section entitled "What you told us", the DWP notes concern that the plan "could increase isolation and reduce independence, have significant financial impact, and cause deterioration in their physical and mental health". Respondents warned that the 20m criteria would mean some disabled people needing support from other public services, increasing the cost for the government. "The most common suggestion made by respondents", the DWP reports, "was to extend the qualifying distance for the enhanced rate from 20m to a longer distance". Nowhere in the government's response to the consultation is there evidence that anyone thought the 20m criteria was the right policy. "Having considered all these factors", the DWP response concludes, "the government believes that the use of 20m is the best way of identifying those whose physical mobility is most limited". It is, of course, the democratic right of ministers to consult and to listen and then ignore. The arguments put forward by the DWP may be compelling. But it does lead some to ask whether the consultation really had much value. A similar question might be posed following the government's response on Tuesday to consultations on two proposals concerning immigrants. The Home Office published the results of the public consultation on plans for a levy on temporary non-EEA migrants as a contribution towards the costs of possible NHS care while in the UK. It is a move that ministers claim enjoys considerable public support, but the consultation came back with a rather different view. On the principle of a levy, "34% felt that temporary migrants should make a direct contribution to the costs of their healthcare. Sixty-two per cent disagreed," it found. The Home Office notes differences depending upon the "type of respondent". Among the general public, 65% were against the plan. Among organisations that responded, 77% were opposed. Health-sector respondents, however, were in favour - 66% felt temporary migrants should contribute to the cost of their healthcare. It is the view of 235 health sector respondents, representing around 12% of the total, that appears to have swayed ministers most. "We have considered all responses to these questions carefully but remain convinced that only permanent migrants should be automatically eligible for free NHS care." Consultations are not referendums. In a way, it seems odd the Home Office should go to such trouble to quantify the proportions for and against the policy since the exercise is not designed as an X-factor style public vote. But having conducted a public consultation and expressing gratitude to all those "who have taken the time to respond and to those who have contributed their experience and insight to what is a complex issue", one is left wondering what the point was. The government response to a separate consultation, also published on Tuesday, invites the same question. This time the proposal under scrutiny was the introduction of a legal obligation on landlords to check the immigration status of tenants. "While between one-third and two-fifths of respondents supported the proposal," the Home Office response states, "slightly more than half of all respondents disagreed." The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors considered it "inappropriate to use private landlords and lettings agents to help deliver the government's immigration policy". The majority of landlord representative organisations were opposed. "The most widely expressed concern by third sector organisations," the Home Office reveals, "was the potential to impact on vulnerable people, such as those who were homeless, those with learning difficulties and those fleeing domestic abuse". The response? "The government has carefully considered the responses to the consultation and remains convinced of an urgent need for action to deter illegal migration and to safeguard the legitimate housing market." The consultation may lead to ministers including an amendment designed to counter discrimination against foreign national tenants. But on the broad proposal, it seems the exercise has not shifted government thinking one jot. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), "public consultation is one of the key regulatory tools employed to improve transparency, efficiency and effectiveness of regulation". But there has long been scepticism as to whether such exercises are anything more than cosmetic. The public consultation is an opportunity for ministers to test their ideas with experts, those directly affected and voters more generally. Community participation on proposed legislation is seen as a key component of "citizen power". But formal public consultation exercises very rarely result in a government re-think - even if they reveal profound concern. That is not the point of them, and we should not pretend otherwise. </body>

      <title>Sifting through the data mountain</title>
      <description>What is the use of performance figures to patients?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24651405</url>
      <date>1382661465</date>

      <body>The Care Quality Commission has gathered together a mountain of data. A total of 161 hospital trusts have been assessed against 150 measures from mortality and infection rates to errors and patient survey results. Even taking into account the fact that not all the data was applicable to every trust there is still well over 12,000 bits of data to wade through. So how can patients navigate their way around it? The first thing to say is that this is not a final judgement on hospital trusts. That will come over the next two years as the inspection programme is rolled out. Instead, the CQC has referred to it as a screening tool rather than diagnosis - it is to be used to prioritise which trust to visit first. But that does not mean it cannot and should not be used by patients. What the regulator has done is pull together all the key bits of information already available on performance and provided an analysis of which hospital trusts are furthest outside the expected range. Until the inspection process is complete, it is perhaps the most comprehensive and informative assessment of what is happening in the NHS at the moment. But it does not mean the exercise is fool-proof. That much is clear already. For example, four of the trusts put into special measures earlier this year because of serious concerns about standards did not make it into the highest risk band one category. In fact two (Burton Hospitals and George Eliot) ended up in band three. Although all were subsequently bumped up to band one because of the issues already identified. When the final ratings are produced it is likely some of those judged low risk will get a bad rating, while some of the high risk ones will be given a good or outstanding rating. One of the reasons for this may be related to the fact the different measures have not been weighted for seriousness. For example a trust with a high sickness rate or poor uptake of vaccination among its staff would get the same risk rating as another with a high mortality rate. In some ways, that is understandable. For example, a trust with high absence rates is likely to have a problem with morale and management. That is not good for patients. The problem is that we just do not know yet whether it is an accurate way of risk profiling. The regulator has promised to fine-tune its system as it goes along. Of the first 18 trusts to be inspected, there is an even spread between the top two bands, the middle two and the bottom two. That will give it an early indication of the accuracy of its methods. In the meantime, patients can pour through the individual reports that have been produced for each trust here. There is a summary page of the risks identified, setting out the areas for which the trust has a poor record. It will be up to patients to decide what to do with the information and whether they want to exercise choice where they can. But as one person who is heavily involved in analysing data for the NHS put it to me: "If you can avoid it, why would you go to a hospital where there is much more evidence of risk than another?" </body>

      <body>The Grangemouth petrochemical plant near Falkirk is to stay open after a new deal was struck with workers. Staff were told in a mass meeting at 11:00 that the decision to close the site would be reversed. Operator Ineos announced on Wednesday that the plant was to shut, with the loss of 800 jobs, after union members rejected a survival plan. But on Friday, Ineos said it would reopen the plant and the neighbouring oil refinery "with immediate effect". The news was welcomed by the Unite union and political leaders. The company said the move had followed a "dramatic U-turn" by Unite and its "belated recognition" that the company's survival plan was the only way to ensure Grangemouth's long-term future. It added that Unite had agreed to taking no strike action for three years, moving to a "modern" pension scheme and accepting a three-year pay freeze. Ineos also confirmed it would invest a further £300m in the site's long-term future. The company's announcement was greeted by huge cheers from the workforce, who had gathered at the plant to be told of the company's decision. Unite Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said: "Relief will ring right round the Grangemouth community, and across Scotland today. "Hundreds of jobs that would have been lost can now be saved and £300m will be invested into the plant." First Minister Alex Salmond described the announcement as a "tremendous fillip for the workforce and the whole Grangemouth community, following what could have been a potential disaster". He said it had been "a great team effort from all concerned", including the unions and workforce, the management and governments. "I am delighted that people have rallied round to protect these jobs, and now we can all agree that Grangemouth has an outstanding future," he added. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael also welcomed the announcement, saying that it was "the news that we all wanted". "The staff and their families have been through a very stressful and uncertain time," he said. "They have been through a hell of a week and I hope they have a much better weekend as a result of today's announcement." Mr Carmichael added: "They can look to the future with an optimism which was absent earlier in the week." Ineos' future plans include investing a further £300m in the site. Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean said: "It is a huge investment and that investment was only rightly to be done if we had a long-term sustainable base. "What we have now done is given the chemicals business another 15 to 20 years on the back of new raw materials, new contracts and significant investment." Mr MacLean would not dismiss the prospect of redundancies, but said they would be "very limited". He also denied that the company had demanded any additional concessions from the union. The company said the Scottish government had indicated it would support its application for a £9m grant to help finance a gas terminal, while the UK government had given "pre-qualification approval" for a £125m loan guarantee facility. Ineos founder and chairman Jim Ratcliffe said it was "a victory for common sense". He told the BBC that the Grangemouth complex "should have a life for many years to come, as long as we can get this gas terminal built and we can sign up gas contracts and bring gas in from America". The company has indicated that 2,000 contractors it laid off after shutting down the complex would be re-hired to support investment in its survival plan. Falkirk Council, which had planned to set up a task force to respond to the threatened closure, said the Ineos announcement was "the best possible outcome for all concerned". Council leader Craig Martin added: "There has been a tremendous effort behind the scenes to secure the plant's future involving UK and Scottish governments and Falkirk Council, working together to ensure the plant's survival. "This partnership approach has paid off and a more stable and positive future for the workforce has been delivered." The closure move came after workers rejected a deal which would have changed their pay and pensions. Ministers and Unite were involved in top-level talks on Thursday to try to save the site and a fresh offer was made by unions to the company. </body>

      <description>Scottish Labour's Cara Hilton wins the Dunfermline by-election for the Scottish Parliament, taking the seat from the SNP.</description>

      <body>Labour has won the Scottish Parliament by-election in Dunfermline, after beating the SNP by almost 3,000 votes. The victory represented a gain from the SNP, who took the seat in the 2011 Holyrood election. The by-election was caused by the resignation of sitting MSP Bill Walker, who was thrown out of the SNP and jailed for domestic abuse. Cara Hilton, the parliament's newest MSP, said the people of Dunfermline "deserved better". The SNP won Dunfermline as part of its landslide election win in 2011 with a majority of just 590 votes, but was not able to hold on. In the end, Labour took the seat with a majority of 2,873 - a 7% swing from the SNP. The Liberal Democrats came third in the contest, with the Conservatives in fourth place. Ms Hilton said: "After the disgrace of Bill Walker, Dunfermline deserves better and I will ensure that we will be better - far better than what went before." And ahead of the SNP administration's independence referendum next year, she added: "We need a Scottish government that will address the needs of Scots, not one that will simply make promises about what will happen after 2016. "Today Dunfermline has sent a message to Bute House and Alex Salmond: it's time for you to focus on the real priorities of Scots, not your constitutional obsession." The by-election campaign centred on contentious local issues, including proposed school closures, while the SNP focused on its national policies such as the council tax freeze and the decision to remove the tolls on the nearby Forth Road Bridge. Despite the result, SNP candidate Shirley-Anne Somerville said she was proud of the campaign she fought. "We've run a positive campaign trying to support local parents in their schools and I hope we can come together, all of us in the party, to make sure those three schools in the Dunfermline constituency stay open," she said. The Liberal Democrats saw their vote drop by 8% on the night. Candidate Susan Leslie said: "I think it has been a victory for women in politics in Scotland that four women stood in this by-election and fought positive campaigns on the issues for Dunfermline." Scottish Conservative candidate James Reekie - whose party saw a 1% increase in its vote - added: "When the people of Dunfermline are faced with the dilemma of Labour and the SNP, they chose the Conservatives." Turnout in the by-election was 42.65%. </body>

      <body>A major search has been launched after a passenger was reported missing from a ferry in the Northern Isles. The passenger - believed to be in his 40s - was thought to have gone overboard from the NorthLink ferry Hrossey, which was sailing from Kirkwall in Orkney to Lerwick in Shetland. The area being searched is to the east of the island of Sanday in Orkney. Three lifeboats and a coastguard helicopter were involved in the search. A fisheries protection vessel and a local fishing boat were also assisting. Ferry operator NorthLink said the captain of the Hrossey was notified of the incident at about 04:00. They said he immediately turned his vessel to begin a search for the passenger. The MV Hrossey left Kirkwall at 00:25 and had been due to arrive in Lerwick at 07:30. It had 172 passengers on board. Hrossey was later released from the search, and headed to Lerwick. </body>

      <description>A Royal Navy officer who was skippering a racing yacht that hit an oil tanker in the Solent is found guilty of contravening maritime regulations.</description>

      <body>A Royal Navy officer who was skippering a racing yacht that hit an oil tanker in the Solent has been found guilty of contravening maritime regulations. The Atalanta of Chester, belonging to Lt Roland Wilson, of Stanley, Perthshire, collided with the 260m-long Hanne Knutsen during Cowes Week 2011. The 32-year-old was convicted at Southampton Magistrates' Court of impeding the passage of a vessel. He was also found guilty of failing to keep a proper lookout. Mr Wilson, who was a serving Royal Navy officer at the time but is now a lieutenant in the reserves, had seen the tanker from five miles (8km) away, the court heard. It had been making its way to Fawley oil refinery. Wilson had told the court the ship had signalled to turn but never did, describing its manoeuvre as "unexpected". District Judge Anthony Callaway said he took the wrong decision in continuing towards the path of the tanker and not taking evasive action. The moment of impact was filmed and the video posted on YouTube, where it was watched more than 924,000 times. Mr Callaway said: "Fortuitous it was that there was no loss of life. The potential for even greater and tragic consequence is, in my judgement, apparent. "This was a serious yacht crewed by serious people in a regatta for a serious purpose. It was well equipped in terms of experience and ability to deal with any situation. "This was not some Saturday afternoon jaunt by some inadequate vessel crewed by inexperienced, clueless and foolhardy people who frankly have no business being on the water at all. "The yacht took a decision, and as I find the wrong decision, to sail towards the problem into the path of the tanker across a narrow channel. It should have kept clear and in the worst event used her engine." The judge said conditions in the Solent were crowded due to Cowes Week but the yacht's crew were experienced enough to perform the "difficult manoeuvre". He added: "The fact it didn't do so was the product not of a lack of skill, but the product of the wrong decision at the wrong time, for which the skipper, Roland Wilson, must take responsibility." Mr Wilson was ordered to pay a fine of £3,000, and costs of more than £100,000. The yacht, which had a crew of eight, suffered a damaged mast and its sail almost became entangled in the anchor of the Hanne Knutsen. One crew member suffered minor head injuries and another abandoned ship after the collision with the 120,000-tonne tanker. Mr Wilson was convicted of one count of failing to keep a proper lookout and two counts of impeding the passage of a tanker in a restricted channel. </body>

      <body>Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum is showing 14 new acquisitions in a major redisplay of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Glasgow Style works. The eight purchases and six donations add new metalwork, ceramics, glass and stained glass to the collection. They include pieces by David Gauld, Archibald Knox, Alexander Ritchie and Christopher Dresser. The redisplay also features other works from Glasgow's civic collection which have not been on show for decades. The eight purchases were made with financial support from The National Fund for Acquisitions administered through National Museums Scotland, the Art Fund and The Heritage Lottery Fund. Councillor Archie Graham, chairman of Glasgow Life, the body which runs Kelvingrove Museum, said the city had "arguably one of the finest civic collections in Europe" thanks to help from partner bodies who helped with funding. "Together we have been able to bring beautiful works by important artists, several of them born in our great city, to the millions of people who visit Kelvingrove every year," he said. "This new display provides plenty to marvel at and an opportunity to learn a little more about their influences and techniques." Glasgow Life said the new acquisitions "reveal the skills, experimentation, influences and imagination" of artists working across Britain between the 1880s and 1930s in the Glasgow Style or part of the wider Arts and Crafts movement. One of the new items on show is a stained and leaded glass panel entitled 'Music', which was designed by Glasgow Boy David Gauld. The piece was made by the Glasgow stained glass workshop of Hugh McCulloch and Company around 1891. Another new exhibit is a copper kettle by Christopher Dresser, a pioneer of the British Design Reform Movement, dating from about 1880 to 1885. This piece was made by Benham and Froud of London. </body>

      <body>The wife of a security guard charged with murdering a conference delegate at Glasgow's SECC complex has told his trial he has a violent temper. Paula Carter told the High Court in Glasgow that she had called police on a number of occasions about her husband Clive's outbursts towards her. Carter, 35, denies murdering Khanokporn Satjawat, 42, from Thailand, at the Clyde Auditorium on 12 November 2012. He has admitted killing her while suffering diminished responsibility. Mrs Satjawat died while attending a conference for HIV drug therapy at the Clyde Auditorium, which is part of the SECC complex. She sustained massive head and facial injuries after being battered with a fire extinguisher in a female toilet. Carter, from Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, was working as a security guard at the venue at the time of the incident. He has claimed he has no memory of the killing or alleged attempts to cover it up. During evidence on Friday, Paula Carter said her husband was prone to violent outbursts. She said that on one occasion he grabbed one of her children by the throat. The witness described violent attacks where he threw laptops at her and smashed up their kitchen. She said he sometimes acted like a child who has no reasoning, stamping his feet. Mrs Carter also said the episodes happen suddenly and that sometimes her husband does not understand what he has done. The trial before Lord Matthews continues. </body>

      <body>Two men who spent almost £7,000 with an OAP's credit card have been told to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work. Soham Emmanuel, 21, from Glasgow, pled guilty to duping Catherine Black, 86, into handing over her card and PIN. He also admitted fraudulently obtaining a Macbook, two iPads and other goods totalling £4,200 from Tesco stores. Nouman Chaudhary, 20, also from Glasgow, admitted fraud charges, and charges of theft by taking money out using the card, totalling £2,659. At Glasgow Sheriff Court, both men were told to carry out the unpaid work as part of a year-long community payback order. The court heard how Mrs Black agreed to hand her card over after being contacted at her home in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire. On 26 June last year, Emmanuel went with another other man to collect the card at Mrs Black's home. It was accepted by the Crown that he sat in a car and did not go to the door, but that he knew why he was there. After obtaining the card, Emmanuel, from Drumchapel, went on a spending spree, buying a Macbook, two iPads and other goods from various Tesco stores. The court heard that the following day, the card was passed to Chaudhary, from Pollokshields. He also bought a number of goods, including two laptops and cigarettes, and withdrew cash using Mrs Black's card. Both men were caught after Mrs Black spoke to a family member about what had happened. The registration of the car used during Chaudhary's shopping trips was traced and both accused were found in the car along with "incriminating articles". The court was told that the bank compensated Mrs Black for her loss but the unrecovered loss from both accused amounted to about £4,000. </body>

      <title>Sharp rise in council's rent arrears</title>
      <description>North Lanarkshire Council claims more than 2,000 of its tenants are in rent arrears for the first time after housing benefit changes.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24662376</url>
      <date>1382706036</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70698000/jpg/_70698042_houses.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>More than 2,000 people in one part of Scotland have got into rent arrears for the first time since changes to housing benefit were made in the spring. North Lanarkshire Council thinks it is owed £675,000 from tenants because of the spare room subsidy - dubbed the bedroom tax, by critics. The council is the largest local authority landlord in Scotland. It also believes many people who could be eligible for help to deal with their benefit cut have not applied for it. This is the most detailed assessment so far of the impact of the changes on one council area in Scotland. More than 5,000 council tenants in North Lanarkshire lost some of their housing benefit in April because they were deemed to have spare bedrooms. An analysis produced by the council - covering the six months up to September - said 2,333 tenants who previously had no rent arrears owed the authority money by September. A further 1,100 already had rent arrears before the changes took place. This meant that 3,449 of the 5,201 people who lost some of their housing benefit in North Lanarkshire had rent arrears. Overall, rent arrears over the past six months were up by two thirds compared to the same period last year though the council was stressing the changes to housing benefit were only one reason for this. Tenants now owe the council more than £2.5m in total. The council said about £675,000 of these arrears could be the result of the benefit changes. However, the council also believes that some people who could have been helped by the special discretionary housing payments, available to those affected by the benefit changes, may not have applied for them. This means that some of the arrears may have been avoidable - or that there could have been help for people who have struggled to make up for the loss of benefit. North Lanarkshire said it would not evict tenants solely because of spare room subsidy arrears during this financial year as long as they had contacted the housing service for assistance and advice. A spokesman said: "Clearly the UK government's welfare reforms are already having a significant effect on our tenants. "The council has set aside funds to assist vulnerable people in every way possible but it is essential that tenants who are worried or in difficulty talk to us. "We have hired additional trained advisers who can discuss each case and provide help with applications for financial assistance. We have already helped thousands of people, so anyone who needs that assistance should contact their local housing office." Council leader Jim McCabe condemned the UK government's changes to housing benefit but urged people who have been affected to speak to the council to see if help could be provided. The council has nearly £1.2m available to hand out in these payments - £470,000 of it is from the UK government, the rest is from the council's own budget. So far it has paid out £350,000 in these payments to nearly 2,900 people. Separate figures from the council give some indication of the scale of the arrears that individuals are building up. As of last week, about 460 people have arrears equivalent to the cut in their benefit while 500 have built up new arrears since April of an even greater amount. The other tenants with arrears appear to have tried to make up some of the shortfall or have received help. The Scottish Conservatives' welfare spokesman Alex Johnstone MSP said the figures showed that the issue of welfare reform was not as black and white as the Scottish government, and what he called the "left-wing establishment", would like to make out. Mr Johnstone said: "Welfare reform is a challenge that must be addressed so that it is fair to those who receive, and fair on those who pay for it. "The ever-growing cost of the welfare budget is something which successive governments have failed to address. "But the 'ignore the problem and it might go away' approach simply hasn't worked and has only resulted in fostering a culture of people being left to languish on benefits for years." A spokesperson for the UK Department for Work and Pensions said: "Scotland has been given £10m this year to help vulnerable people and we are monitoring this spending carefully to ensure that tenants get the support they need during welfare reforms. "It is important to remember that housing benefit will still cover the vast majority of people's rent, but the taxpayer can no longer afford to pay for spare bedrooms. "People have a number of options available to them, including moving to another property in the public or private sector, or making up the difference in rent through going into work or working more hours." Scottish Housing Minister Margaret Burgess said: "We know that 80% of households affected by the bedroom tax contain an adult with a recognised disability, and over 15,000 children are affected. "That's why have consistently expressed our opposition to this measure. "The Scottish government is doing all it can to help the people hit by the bedroom tax, with £20m of funding available this year and a further £20m available next year." </body>

      <body>Nicola White has been named as the winner of the 2013 Dundee International Book Prize. Her crime thriller novel, In the Rosary Garden, beat competition from more than 350 entries. The book is inspired by a notorious true case from the 1980s of infanticide in Ireland. The Irish debut novelist has been awarded a publishing deal and a cash prize of £10,000. Her entry was chosen from a final three by a judging panel comprising of Brian Cox, Lorraine Kelly, Norman Foster, Claire Alexander and AL Kennedy. The two runner up titles were Mango, written by Jeff Hayden, and What to do with Lobsters in a Place Like Klippisfontein, by Colette Victor. The ninth winner of the competition, which has been running since 2000, was described by judge AL Kennedy as "courageous and intelligent". Previous publications Although In The Rosary Garden is Nicola's first novel, her short stories have been published widely and broadcast on radio. Last year she was Leverhulme Writer in Residence at the University of Edinburgh and was the 2008 winner of the Scottish Book Trust New Writers Award. The author grew up in Dublin and New York and now lives on the Clyde coast. She previously worked as a contemporary art curator, in Glasgow, and produced arts programmes for BBC radio and television. The decision to award the prize to Ms White was praised by crime novelist Val McDermid who called the book "mesmerising". Ms White said: "I'm just very pleased that the book gets to be ushered into the world in the best way, with editorial care and a bit of fanfare - and the money is no small thing." </body>

      <body>An Edinburgh author has been named the winner of the Edinburgh International Book Festival's 2013 First Book Award. Angela Jackson, one of 42 writers in contention, said it felt "particularly special" to win the prize for her debut novel, The Emergence of Judy Taylor. Visitors to this year's festival voted her book ahead of other first works by such authors as Gill Hornby, sister of Nick, and broadcaster Dawn O'Porter. Jackson's novel tells of a dissatisfied wife who embarks on a new life. "It's great to know I'm on the right track [and] that my work is connecting with readers," the author continued. The former musician and psychology lecturer said the prize would "spur [her] on to complete my second novel". Nick Barley, director of the Edinburgh International Book Festival, said Jackson's triumph was "a wonderful, home-grown success story". "Angela gave her first public reading at the Book Festival in 2010 and appeared again in 2011," he continued. "We were delighted to welcome her this year as a fully fledged and published author." Edinburgh's book festival, held every August in the city's Charlotte Square Gardens, celebrated its 30th anniversary this year. </body>

      <body>A large number of diazepam tablets worth more than £62,000 have been seized by police in Edinburgh. More than 40,000 tablets were found at a property in Broughton Road on Thursday. A 42-year-old man and 26-year-old woman are due to appear at the city's sheriff court. Insp Stevie Dolan said: "Diazepam is a prescribed drug, which should only be taken by those required to consume it for health reasons." He added: "Recovering these pills means we have ensured that they can't make their way into our communities and be used for reasons other than their prescribed purpose. "Police Scotland is committed to tackling drug crime and would urge the public to come forward immediately if they wish to report offences of this nature in their local area." </body>

      <body>A Care Inspectorate order to close Clachnaharry House care home in Inverness could be reviewed. Earlier this month, the watchdog ordered operators RDS Healthcare to shut the home because of concerns about the quality of care provided. The company was given 14 days to ask the inspectorate to review its decision. A spokesman for the watchdog confirmed a request for a review had been received and would be considered. NHS Highland suspended its admissions to the home in November 2012. The Care Inspectorate then served the care home with an improvement notice after raising concerns about the state of flooring and bathrooms. It also highlighted issues over staffing levels and record keeping. RDS Healthcare has plans to close the home temporarily at the end of December to carry out refurbishment work. However, the Care Inspectorate wants more immediate action taken. </body>

      <body>A Scottish health board has uploaded a short film to video sharing website YouTube in a bid to recruit new staff. The video promoting vacancies in NHS Highland's cancer treatment services is the first in a series the board plans to produce to attract new employees. In the six-minute film, workers seek to dismiss misconceptions about the Highlands. Last month, NHS Highland was unsuccessful in a second attempt to fill seven GP vacancies. In the YouTube film, several members of staff talk about what the health board and the Highlands have to offer. They say Inverness's Raigmore Hospital, which has a vacancy for a consultant oncologist, has cutting edge technology to match larger city hospitals. Raigmore has also led the way in the use of image guided radiotherapy, staff point out during the film. The employees have also sought to dispel mistaken ideas about the region. Steve Colligan, head of radiotherapy physics, says: "I think people do believe the Highlands is a bit backwards and not up-to-date and I think it's important to reassure everyone that we have running water and electricity." Dr Carol MacGregor, a Macmillan consultant in clinical oncology, adds that the area offers a wide range of activities that do not involve "Gortex and wellies". The Scottish government has supported the use of video to help attract potential recruits to NHS Highland. Health Secretary Alex Neil said: "I am acutely conscious of the challenges we all face in providing high quality, sustainable healthcare - particularly for those who live in remote and rural communities." He added: "Initiatives such as this film produced by NHS Highland will help to promote the benefits of living and working in Highland." The closing date for applications to the consultant oncologist post is next month. NHS Highland has been facing challenges in recruiting staff to some posts. A renewed effort to fill seven GP vacancies in a remote part of the Highlands was unsuccessful, it emerged last month. NHS Highland re-advertised the posts in the sparsely populated area of West Lochaber after a first round of adverts failed to attract enough applicants. The health board had hoped a new plan for a cluster of local practices would have allayed potential applicants' concerns about having to work alone. But not enough people have come forward to staff that model of cover. The GPs are needed to cover places such as Arisaig, Acharacle and Strontian. </body>

      <body>The 60th anniversary of one of the most tragic days for the RNLI in Arbroath is to be marked this weekend. Six crewmen died when the Robert Lindsay lifeboat was struck by a huge wave close to the harbour on 27 October 1953. Only one man survived. They had been searching for a vessel in distress. Their lives will be commemorated by the local community and the current RNLI crew who will be laying a wreath at sea on Sunday. David Bruce, Harry Swankie, William Swankie, Thomas Adams, David Cargill and Charles Cargill all died in the tragedy. The only survivor was Archibald Smith, who was able to hold on to a rope thrown across the boat by watchers on land. A plaque with the names of the crew is displayed in the Arbroath lifeboat shed in remembrance of the disaster. Alex Smith, the lifeboat operations manager at Arbroath, said: "It is the darkest day in our history here at Arbroath lifeboat station and the sacrifice of those lost has been, and continues to be, an inspiration to generations of crewmen. "Unfortunately, it also serves as a stark reminder of the risks that volunteer lifeboat crews face to help others at sea." Church services will also be held in Arbroath on Sunday to mark the event. All-weather lifeboat RNLB Inchcape will be launched at 15:00 for the wreath-laying ceremony. </body>

      <body>The Dunfermline Building Society is to be merged into its parent company, the Nationwide, with the closure of 25 branches across Scotland. It has looked at duplication where branches are very near each other, and 19 are to be closed for that reason. A further six branches without a nearby alternative will shut. The lender said the change, by next summer, will mean about 90 fewer staff - about a third of the branch workforce. It said it was seeking to avoid redundancies by redeployment. Tony Prestedge, Nationwide's chief operating officer, said: "We have made considerable improvements to our range of products and services, and are now in a position to ensure our members under the Dunfermline brand can have full access to the benefits our other members already enjoy. "It is a logical step to integrate our businesses under one unified, strong, and nationally recognisable brand. "The strength of the Nationwide brand is increasingly compelling and we will offer customers of the Dunfermline a vastly improved proposition. "As well as benefiting from access to our full suite of products and market leading customer service, more people will have access to our strong branch network than at present." The rebranding will take place over one weekend, expected to be in Summer 2014. From the following Monday morning, customers will be able to access their accounts from any Nationwide branded branch and Nationwide's online bank if they have already registered. It has retained Caledonia House, the former headquarters of the Dunfermline Building Society, as a customer service administration and telephone channel centre, for customers across the Nationwide Group. About 300 jobs are to be based at this site. The Dunfermline branches that will be integrating with nearby Nationwide branches are: Ayr, Coatbridge, Dundee, East Kilbride, Falkirk, Glasgow (Hope St), Glenrothes, Inverness, Kirkcaldy, Leven, Livingston, Montrose, Paisley, Perth, Shawlands and Stirling. The Nationwide branches that will integrate with nearby Dunfermline branches are: Cupar, Dunfermline and Hamilton. The Dunfermline branches that will be rebranded Nationwide are: Aberdeen, Anniesland, Edinburgh, Kirkwall, Peebles, Petreavie and St Andrews. The Dunfermline branches that will close are: Castle Douglas, Cowdenbeath, Johnstone, Largs, Rosyth and Tranent. </body>

      <body>Scotland's most senior police officer has pledged to do more to improve road safety in light of a surge in offences. Chief Constable Sir Stephen House said Police Scotland wanted to change the behaviour of drivers who took risks. New figures showed a "significant" increase in the number of road safety offences in the first six months of the new single force, compared with the same period last year. Offences include 52,171 of speeding and 20,440 instances of mobile phone use. There were also 25,451 seatbelt misuse offences. Addressing an audience of road safety experts at the Road Safety Scotland annual seminar in Edinburgh, Sir Stephen said road safety was one of the priorities raised by local communities. "Evidence has shown that regular risky and illegal drivers do not acknowledge the risk they present, or view their own actions as illegal or having any real social impact," he said. "A recent study stated that almost three-quarters of all drivers admitted to risky driving behaviour in the last 12 months and more than half of those admitted to illegal behaviour in relation to speeding, mobile phones and seatbelt use. "There is a common perception among offenders that offences are committed by others, but not by themselves. "Our job is to challenge these perceptions and make people aware that offending behaviour will be dealt with." Sir Stephen said the force would continue to build a trunk roads patrol group throughout the country. "Our focus is on enforcement and by providing a more visible, dedicated resource across our national and local roads networks, we can help deter and detect poor driver behaviour," he said. "Greater enforcement has led to some good early results. However, it is worth remembering that in 2012, 174 people died on our roads - three times more than the homicide rate. "I regard this as simply unacceptable." He added: "We will continue to work with others to improve awareness of road safety and challenge offending behaviour in order to keep people safe on Scotland's roads." </body>

      <title>Women 'better multitaskers' than men</title>
      <description>It is not a myth - women really are better than men at multitasking and employers should bear this in mind, say the authors of a new study.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24645100</url>

      <body>It is not a myth - women really are better than men at multitasking, at least in certain cases, a study says. Men were slower and less organised than women when switching rapidly between tasks in tests by UK psychologists. Both sexes struggled to cope with juggling priorities, but men suffered more on average, according to the paper in the journal BMC Psychology. It says: "The question now is why? And is it all types of multitasking or only certain situations?" The researchers hope to encourage more research on a topic which they say has attracted "astonishingly few" studies - considering how often the "women vs men" debate crops up in conversation. If men really are slower than women, it could have serious implications for how workplaces are organised, says co-author Dr Gijsbert Stoet, of the University of Glasgow. "Multitasking is getting more and more important in the office - but it's very distracting, all these gadgets interrupting our workflow. "It could be that men suffer more from this constant switching," he told BBC News. Previous studies on gender and multitasking have drawn widely different conclusions. One experiment in China found that women outperformed their male counterparts, while another in Sweden found that men may actually be better than women at multitasking when spatial tasks are involved. To settle the argument, Dr Stoet and a colleague set out to compare women and men in a certain type of multitasking; the kind we use when faced with juggling many tasks in rapid succession - but not quite simultaneously. These might include office workers who jump between incoming emails, phone calls and assignments, while running in and out of meetings. Another example might be parents in the household - cooking a meal while looking after young children and suddenly having to answer the phone. First, they compared 120 women and 120 men in a computer test which involves switching between tasks involving counting and shape-recognition. Men and women were equal when tasks were tackled one at a time. But when the tasks were mixed up there was a clear difference. Both women and men slowed down, and made more mistakes, as the switching became more rapid. But the men were significantly slower - taking 77% longer to respond, whereas women took 69% longer. "This difference may seem small, but it adds up" over a working day or week, said Dr Stoet. To make the experiment more relevant to everyday life, the researchers tried a second test. A group of women and men were given eight minutes to complete a series of tasks - locating restaurants on a map, doing simple maths problems, answering a phone call, and deciding how they would search for a lost key in a field. Completing all these assignments in eight minutes was impossible - so it forced men and women to prioritise, organise their time, and keep calm under pressure. In the key search task in particular, women displayed a clear performance advantage over men, says co-author Prof Keith Laws, of the University of Hertfordshire. "You can see from the drawings - women used methodical search patterns, like going round the field in concentric circles. That's a highly productive strategy for finding a lost object. "Whereas some men didn't even search the whole field in any particular manner, which is just bizarre." The reason, he observed, was that women were more organised under pressure. "They spent more time thinking at the beginning, whereas men had a slight impulsiveness, they jumped in too quickly," said Prof Laws. "It suggests that - in a stressed and complex situation - women are more able to stop and think about what's going on in front of them." Altogether, they conclude that women "have an advantage over men" in multitasking, at least in certain situations. "This suggestion does rankle a bit with men," Prof Laws explained. "Men tell me this just doesn't ring true with their experience. They regale me with stories about how the greatest pilots in the RAF are men and they have to deal with lots of different incoming information all the time. "And of course there are men who are experts. We'd never claim that all men can't multitask, or that only women can. "But we'd argue the average woman is better able to organise her time and switch between tasks than the average man. "There's no point denying these differences exist." Psychologist Dr Dongning Ren of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said the study was a useful addition to the scientific debate. "In my own research, I found similar results, so this adds support for this conclusion," she told the BBC. "Still, it is possible that for certain tasks, men might be better at multitasking. It may depend on the nature of the tasks - sequential or simultaneous." In a world where people increasingly have to multitask, we need to help individuals adapt their roles to their abilities, said Prof Laws. "Of course I don't think we should just assign women to roles where rapid switching is demanded," he explained. Instead, employers should consider assessing individuals' ability in multitasking, as some firms already do. "Because the truth is - people don't seem to be very good at assessing themselves," Prof Laws told BBC News. "Studies show that men tend to think they're better at multitasking than they are in reality, and women tend to think they're worse than they really are. "I think I am great at it, but my wife thinks I'm not." If women really are better than men, the obvious question is why? It could be that what Dr Stoet and Prof Laws observed is a learning effect - where people become expert multitaskers by practice. But there are plenty of evolutionary theories too - such as the hunter-gatherer hypothesis. This invokes a rather traditional image of women at home, cooking and tending to the infants, with men out doing so-called "linear" tasks such as chasing and killing prey. "Put simply - if women couldn't multitask, we wouldn't be here," said Dr Stoet. And interestingly - compared to our closest relatives, the apes, we are all terrible at multitasking - men and women alike. If humans have "lost" this ability during evolution, it suggests that our simple, one-track minds could actually give us an advantage, Dr Stoet explained. "Filtering out distractions helps us to achieve things we couldn't otherwise do. Like making fire," he said, offering a grain of comfort to those who find themselves on the wrong side of the divide. </body>

      <body>A financial manager who stole £613,073 from the Glasgow car firm where she worked has been jailed for 32 months. Donna Shedden, 49, from Newton Mearns, East Renfrewshire, admitted embezzling cash from Charlton Chauffeur Drive Ltd between March 2007 and February 2013. Glasgow Sheriff Court heard how Shedden was caught after a suspicious colleague investigated while she was on holiday. Sheriff John McCormick told Shedden, who is married to a Crown prosecutor, that a jail term was unavoidable. The sheriff said he took into consideration all of the circumstances, including that Shedden's "family life has been devastated". He told her that she committed the crime while in a "trusted position" and "only a custodial sentence was appropriate". A previous hearing was told that Shedden used the cash to fund a lavish lifestyle of visiting restaurants and buying jewellery and clothes. She even carried on with the theft when the company struggled financially and employees were let go and wages cut. She was caught when a colleague suspected she was not acting "appropriately" where the company finances were concerned and investigated her while she was on holiday to South Africa. After being confronted by her boss and director of the company Michael O'Hare, Shedden admitted she had taken money and eventually disclosed the full amount. </body>

      <body>A security guard charged with murdering a woman with a fire extinguisher at Glasgow's SECC complex has denied deliberately attempting a cover-up. Clive Carter, 35, from Motherwell, told the High Court in Glasgow: "I don't remember destroying the evidence." He has denied murdering Khanokporn Satjawat, 42, from Thailand, at the Clyde Auditorium on 12 November 2012. Carter has lodged a special defence, admitting culpable homicide due to diminished responsibility. Mrs Satjawat died while attending a conference for HIV drug therapy at the Clyde Auditorium, which is part of the SECC complex. She sustained massive head and facial injuries after being battered with a fire extinguisher in a female toilet. The court was heard how Mrs Satjawat's blood was found on Carter's trousers and on the sleeve of his work blazer and cuffs of his shirt. His DNA was also found on the sleeve of the jumper Mrs Satjawat was wearing. Carter, from Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, was working as a security guard at the venue at the time of the incident. He has claimed he has no memory of the killing. He said he remembered arguing with his victim and the next thing he recalled was eating his sandwiches for lunch minutes later. Giving evidence for a second day, father-of-three Carter was asked by advocate depute John Scullion, prosecuting: "Did you tell a psychiatrist that you have always known that you were responsible for the killing of Khanokporn Satjawat?" He replied: "I was looking back on things. At the time of the incident I wasn't fully aware, it was only after having time to reflect." Carter was asked why he had lied to the police and told them he had seen an Asian man walking about with a fire extinguisher and had taken it from him. He replied: "At the time I thought I was helping the police." When asked if he had in fact seen an Asian man Carter said: "In my head, yes." Mr Scullion said: "Was it because you knew that two delegates had seen you with a fire extinguisher," and Carter replied: "I don't know." He then added: "At the time I didn't know that." Carter also told the jury he had no memory of washing blood from the fire extinguisher and then hiding it in a room in the complex. Mr Scullion said: "You took the fire extinguisher down from the second floor to room 136 and the purpose for that was to clean it of blood," and Carter replied: "I don't remember." He also denied hiding his bloodstained G4S blazer. When asked by Mr Scullion: "This is all utter rubbish isn't it," Carter replied: "No it's not." The trial later heard that Carter had told psychiatrist Dr Alex Quinn that he was in prison for "killing a woman" over a "silly" argument about checking a badge. Carter also told the psychiatrist that Mrs Satjawat told him to stop pestering her and was annoyed at being asked to show her security pass. Earlier, Mr Scullion showed CCTV footage taken 16 minutes before her death which showed Mrs Satjawat was wearing her pass round her neck. He then asked: "When you beat her with the fire extinguisher was she wearing her badge," and Carter replied: "Yes." The prosecutor then said: "Was she wearing her badge when she left the auditorium to go to the toilet," and he replied: "No." Mr Scullion went on: "Can I just suggest to you that you have been lying all day about your memory of this event," and Cater shouted: "No, not at all." The prosecutor added: "You have known throughout that you beat her to death," and Carter again shouted loudly: "No, not at all." Carter denies murdering Mrs Satjawat and attempting to defeat the ends of justice by hiding evidence. The trial before Lord Matthews continues. </body>

      <body>Inverness Caledonian Thistle posted a modest gain of £22,000 on the financial year to 31 May; the club's first profit since 2007. The results are a marked improvement on last year's deficit of £379,000. Last season, the Highlanders enjoyed their highest ever placing in the top flight, finishing fourth, despite trimming the wage bill for players. And the club say they continue to operate without any long-term debt or overdraft facilities. There was no cash generated by player sales, with Owain Tudor Jones and Andrew Shinnie among those leaving the club under freedom of contract, but clinching fourth-place resulted in a healthy increase in prize money after a 10th-place finish in 2011/12. Revenue was also boosted by a run to the League Cup semi-finals. "At the start of this financial year, the board in conjunction with the management team had to make some serious cuts to the playing budget following consecutive years of losses which, though manageable, could not be sustained in the long term," said chairman Kenny Cameron. "It is testament to the shrewdness and undoubted skills in 'talent spotting' of Terry Butcher and Maurice Malpas, ably assisted by head scout Steve Marsella, that, having made the cuts in the playing budget, the team excelled under their leadership." Caley Thistle's turnover for this financial year was £3,721,192 compared to £3,443,053 the year before, while administrative expenses were down £111,000. "Our strategy and business model have served us well," added Cameron. "We have substantially reduced our cost base. We have excellent people and a robust strategy that will ensure we continue to improve as a club and a business and strive for the long-term sustainability of the company. "We have improved our balance sheet position from a £60,000 negative in 2012 to a healthy £238,000 positive position, a key health check in any business."

      <body>The consortium of international companies that owns and manages Dounreay Site Restoration Limited (DSRL) is changing its name. From next week Babcock Dounreay Partnership will be called Cavendish Dounreay Partnership. The consortium is overseeing DSRL's work decommissioning Dounreay, an experimental nuclear power complex on the north Caithness coast. The site's original buildings such as its dome are to be demolished by 2025. The rebranding follows the decision of Babcock International Group, which has a 50% stake in the parent body organisation, to call its civil nuclear business unit Cavendish Nuclear. The other partners in the consortium, CH2MHILL and URS, as well as the rest of Babcock International Group, are unaffected by the change. </body>

      <body>A man who repeatedly raped a nine-year-old girl has been jailed for five years and four months. Paul Barrett, 44, from Inverness, abused the child at an address in Cannich in the Highlands between 1 April 2012 and 17 February this year. The High Court in Edinburgh heard how Barrett forced the child to participate in sexual acts with him. He pleaded guilty to a rape charge at the High Court last month. Sentence had been deferred for reports. Defence advocate Shahid Latif told the court that Barrett was sorry for his conduct and had fully co-operated with the police and prosecutors. Mr Latif added: "Nothing can be said to justify or mitigate a crime of this nature. "Mr Barrett is an individual who has realised the devastation of what he has done." Passing sentence Lord Pentland described Barrett as "cruel, devious and manipulative". He added: "Society has a complete abhorrence towards crimes of this nature and it is the responsibility of the courts to reflect that and to deter others who may be persuaded to commit crimes of this type." </body>

      <body>A cameraman had an unexpected regular visitor while filming seals in Orkney for the BBC's The Great British Year television programme. Raymond Besant was filming a grey seal colony from a hide, but discovered it damaged. To his surprise, he found one of the seal pups hiding inside - and it kept returning. Mr Besant said: "He did have the good grace to get out when he saw me approaching." He explained: "I was filming over a period of three weeks and had a hide positioned at the top of the shore to avoid disturbing the seals too much. "But after two weeks of filming I noticed one morning that the hide looked damaged. "I thought it was just the bad weather but when I opened the back of the hide I found a young seal sleeping inside it." He went on: "The dilemma was how to get him out of the hide, I needed to get on with filming and I didn't want to get bitten. "I gently shook the hide and eventually he shuffled out. He had wrecked the hide, he was still moulting so there was fur everywhere and it smelled pretty bad, like wet dog. "I put some driftwood and things that were lying on the shore across the entrance to stop him coming in again as he had bent the hide poles over so far I couldn't close the entrance properly." "When I came down the next morning I was surprised to see his head poking out again. The wood was no barrier, he just bounced over the top of it. "So I took the driftwood away and decided that if he was going to go in I couldn't stop him. So for a week I arrived each morning to find him there." The wildlife cameraman added: "He was just a clever seal that had found somewhere warm and dry to stay." The footage appears in the autumn programme of The Great British Year which airs on BBC1 at 21:00 on Wednesday and is also available on the iPlayer. </body>

      <body>Environmental experts have said they have seen no evidence that non-native crayfish are getting into cattle feed near a loch in Dumfries and Galloway. A meeting was held near Loch Ken earlier this month and concerns had been raised that North American signal crayfish were getting into silage. However, Scottish Natural Heritage said it had seen nothing to suggest it was a major problem in the area. It added the chances of their survival in silage bales were "very low". An SNH statement also stressed it would not expect farmers in the area to stop making silage and feeding it to their animals. The organisation said it was "very concerned" about the spread of signal crayfish in Scotland. "They present a significant threat to native wildlife and to fisheries," a statement said. "In most cases they have been deliberately introduced by the irresponsible actions of people, even though it is illegal. "We have been at the forefront of work to try and control and eradicate crayfish from freshwater habitats in the UK and beyond." SNH said a wide range of techniques had been tried. These have included trapping, removal of crayfish by hand, electrofishing, biocides and developing and installing a barrier to try and prevent them moving from the River Clyde to the River Annan catchment. "Unfortunately, there is nothing currently available that will get rid of them from Loch Ken, or anywhere else," the statement added. "Once established, they are virtually impossible to eradicate. "However, we are always open to new ideas and techniques that come forward." The problem at Loch Ken has existed for a number of years. Millions of the crayfish have infested the once-thriving angling waters. </body>

      <body>A man who built a DIY power plant in his bedroom has been given a one year community payback order. Charles McKenzie, 55, from Dundee, set up the homemade electricity system after his power was cut off due to unpaid bills. Police made the discovery after a strong smell of petrol and the sound of drilling was reported from his flat. He pled guilty to a charge of culpable and reckless conduct as well as two charges of stealing electricity. Dundee Sheriff Court was told how police and the fire service were called to McKenzie's home at 03:00 on 28 August 2012 after a complaint from a neighbour. Fiscal depute Lynne Mannion told Dundee Sheriff Court: "There was a strong smell of fumes throughout the flat. In a bedroom there was a generator suspended by thin ropes. "It was connected to a transformer and a car battery with an extension lead running to the living room. "There were two cans of petrol beside the generator. It was noted McKenzie was a smoker, which would increase risk. "The generator gave off exhaust fumes with carbon monoxide." Defence solicitor Mike Short said: "He is in a flat too big for him - it's two bedroom and he lives alone and with the current regulations that's a difficulty. "I believe he should be entitled to be rehoused." Sheriff George Way said: "I just don't see that there are any sentencing options other than custody that make any sense at all. But I'm not inclined to do that. "I appreciate what he was doing was very, very dangerous and risky, but I accept he had reached a stage where he was making desperate decisions." Sheriff George Way issued the community payback order and ordered a review hearing in January. </body>

      <title>Body raises post-vote pension issues</title>
      <description>Debate about pension provision in an independent Scotland still lacks clarity in key areas, according to the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.</description>

      <body>Debate about pension provision in an independent Scotland still lacks clarity in key areas, according to a professional body. European status and what currency would be used were among the main issues at stake, the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA) suggested. The Scottish government published a paper last month on pensions, if independence is backed. It said the basic state pension would still be paid "on time and in full". The document added that from 2016 new pensioners would be given £160 a week - making them £1.10 better off than those in the rest of the UK. The people of Scotland will vote in the Scottish independence referendum on 18 September next year. They will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country." Martin Potter, leader of the Scottish board at IFoA, said: "Scotland becoming an independent country would have a significant impact on financial services, including pensions and insurance, the regulation of the sector and its future growth. "As an independent professional body with a Royal Charter, the IFoA has a public-interest duty to uphold. "In raising questions that it believes to be pertinent, the IFoA looks to serve the public interest by informing the debate on these important issues ahead of next September's referendum. "Whether a referendum results in an independent Scotland or not, it is right that discussion about how change could affect Scotland happens now. "Across the sector, we are still limited by the lack of clarity to date on the status of an independent Scotland in relation to the EU and the many financial implications of that uncertainty, all of which need to be considered." The paper looks at challenges facing financial services and at cross-border schemes, raising concern about the future of underfunded pension plans. In April, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland said changes to pension rules with Scottish independence could force substantial costs on employers with unfunded schemes. European directives mean UK-wide schemes would be deemed "cross-border" and need to be fully funded, the body said. The reported stated: "This is as important a subject for rUK (the rest of the UK) as it is for Scotland. "Many employers based in rUK have Scottish employees. For those companies and their staff, a definitive view on this matter would be very welcome. As such, the matters highlighted within this section would apply to all post-independence cross-border schemes." </body>

      <title>Rent arrears up since benefit reform</title>
      <description>Rent arrears owed to housing associations and local authorities rose in the three months after the spare room subsidy was abolished, according to a study.</description>

      <body>Rent arrears owed to housing associations and local authorities rose in the three months after the spare room subsidy was abolished, according to a study. The Scottish Housing Regulator (SHR), has published research on the early impact of the measure, which has been dubbed the bedroom tax by critics. It said arrears increased by £789,000 in the period to the end of June 2013. It comes against a background of rising arrears in the past two years. SHR said the report, based on feedback from almost 85% of social landlords, gave the fullest available picture of the early effects of welfare reform on Scottish landlords' rent arrears. Iain Muirhead, the regulator's director of strategy and communications, said: "We want to get more information and see a fuller picture before we would draw any firm conclusions on what is happening and why. "Our research establishes a baseline and we will repeat it each quarter and report the findings." But the Early Impacts of Welfare Reform report revealed that the level of arrears had reduced during the period between March and June in each of the previous two years. In 2011 it fell by £3.5m and by £2.8m in 2012. The report said the total amount owed in rent at 30 June 2013 was £63,125,355, although this included amounts carried over from previous years. It said most landlords were facing the same problems in dealing with the effects of welfare reform. They identified increased workload and income reduction as their two biggest challenges. Support, advice and information to tenants featured prominently in the actions landlords were taking to address the early impact. David Ogilvie, policy manager for the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, said the report provided concrete evidence of a worrying trend. "This heralds tough times ahead for Scottish social landlords - be they housing associations, co-operatives or local authorities - as they face the twin challenges of increasing service delivery costs and reducing income. "Both of these challenges arise directly from welfare reform." The benefit changes form part of a revamped system. Under the new housing rules, 14% will be deducted from housing benefit for one "spare" bedroom and a quarter for two or more. The government says the changes should ensure that people are in suitably sized accommodation and release larger accommodation for people who need it. </body>

      <title>UK growth fastest for three years</title>
      <description>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show, the fastest growth since 2010.</description>

      <body>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show. The Office for National Statistics said there had been a "fairly strong" performance across all sectors. The data builds on a 0.7% GDP rise in the April-June period and is the best quarterly performance since 2010. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne tweeted: "This shows that Britain's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity." Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the figures "show that we are firmly on the road to economic recovery". The ONS data for construction was up 2.5% over the quarter, the second successive quarter of growth after a volatile performance over the past year. The BBC's chief economics correspondent, Hugh Pym, said: "This could signal that a recovery in that sector is really under way." House-builders have been buoyed by the Government's Help to Buy scheme, which recently launched a new phase offering mortgage guarantees. The ONS said that production grew by 0.5%, though this remains 12.8% off its 2008 level, while within this, manufacturing improved 0.9% in the third quarter. The services sector, which represents three-quarters of economic output, grew by 0.7%. Output from services is now above its pre-crisis peak in the first quarter of 2008. Friday's figure is the first estimate, and could be revised up or down in subsequent months. Mr Osborne told the BBC: "It shows that we are on the path to prosperity. Lots of risks remain, so we have to stick with the economic plan that has got us this far. "What's encouraging about these figures is that it's not just services that are growing. Construction is growing and manufacturing is growing." Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: "After three damaging years of flatlining, it's both welcome and long overdue that our economy is growing again. "But for millions of people across the country still seeing prices rising faster than their wages, this is no recovery at all." Despite the further evidence that recovery is gaining hold, some economists remain cautious. The Institute of Directors' chief economist Graeme Leach said: "The outlook looks better than at any time since the onset of the financial crisis. Indeed, our members have more confidence in the economy than at any time since 2008. "However, strong headwinds remain and the annual growth rate year on year is nothing to get too excited about yet. Though inflationary pressures are likely to remain benign, debt and inflation are rising faster than earnings. "By far the biggest challenges remain on the supply side, not the demand side. Supply side constraints mean that the current growth spurt is unlikely to extend beyond next year. "This stage of our economic recovery is likely to be short and sweet, instead of long and strong." The director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, John Longworth, said: "This is the highest quarterly increase we've seen in three years, so the economy is clearly moving in the right direction. "But we are still behind a number of advanced economies, such as the US and Germany, that have managed to recover the output lost during the economic downturn. "Much more needs to be done to transform our economy from being good to being really great." Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said the figures confirmed the UK was enjoying "a period of healthy and well-balanced growth". He said it was likely that the UK recorded the fastest quarterly growth rate within the G7 countries in the third quarter. But he added that a squeeze on real incomes as wage growth lagged behind inflation, together with the fiscal squeeze and a stagnant eurozone, were likely to prevent recovery gathering much more pace. It echoed remarks by Bank of England governor Mark Carney on Thursday evening, when he said in a speech that the rate of growth was "towards the top end of the advanced economies", but "coming from a very very low base". </body>

      <body>Scottish Power has announced a price rise of 8.6% for dual-fuel energy bills from 6 December. The company said it would increase gas prices by 8.5% and electricity prices by 9%. The move comes amid political wrangling over the issue of energy bills, with the government planning to review the green levies that form part of a bill. On Monday, Scottish Power was hit by an £8.5m penalty for misleading doorstep and telephone sales. The price rise would lead to a £113 increase in the average annual dual-fuel bill to £1,424, Scottish Power said. It will affect about 2.2 million Scottish Power customers. However, different areas of the country will face different price increases. For example, the rise will be 10.2% on average in southern England, but 7.3% in some areas of Scotland. Scottish Power is the fourth of the six major energy suppliers to announce price rises. SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills from 15 November, British Gas said prices for its customers would go up by 9.2% on 23 November, and Npower announced the biggest rise of 10.4% which will take effect from 1 December. Scottish Power echoed the views of other suppliers by suggesting that the price rises were the result of the rising wholesale cost of energy. The cost of delivering energy to people's homes, and the rising cost of the government's environmental and social schemes were also to blame, it said. Neil Clitheroe, chief executive of energy retail and generation for Scottish Power, said that there were a number of costs - such as windfarm payments - that did not exist 10 years ago, but which affected bills. "With an increase in costs for delivering compulsory schemes to reduce carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency in homes, we unfortunately have no other option than to pass these on by increasing our prices for customers," he said. "We understand that these are difficult times for many families, and we have done what we can to hold our prices for as long as possible. Recently we announced a range of measures to help our most vulnerable customers this winter. "We will now write to every customer who will be impacted by the price increase, and we would encourage anyone who is concerned to contact us so we can discuss their options." Ann Robinson, of price comparison website Uswitch.com, which would benefit from people switching supplier, said: "Unfortunately, the floodgates have opened and it looks like consumers are going to be buffeted by suppliers in very quick succession." Iberdrola, the Spanish parent group of Scottish Power, said that its UK operations had been affected by tight margins, as well as by energy efficiency and environmental measures imposed by the regulator. "As a consequence, generation and supply is now loss-making, and leaves the company no option but to increase tariffs," it said. There has been considerable political debate over the price rises. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election and has been on the attack over the issue. Subsequently, Prime Minister David Cameron said that there would be a review of the green levies charged to companies that are included in bills. He said this accounted for £113 on an average bill - the same amount as Scottish Power's subsequent price rise announcement. The review will be followed by a competition test for the energy market to establish how it is functioning. The Liberal Democrats called the idea a "panicky U-turn" by Mr Cameron, although Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg later said some of the environmental policies could be delivered in a more cost-effective way. On Tuesday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. On Tuesday, energy firm bosses will give evidence to a committee of MPs about the price rises. Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies introduced price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. Earlier this week, the regulator, Ofgem, said that Scottish Power customers were misled during sales approaches due to the firm's failure to "adequately train and monitor" staff. The company apologised for the errors between 2009 and 2012, and has set up a £1m compensation fund for customers who believe they were victims of mis-selling. It said it would also pay £7.5m to the 140,000 customers it has on the government-led "warm home discount scheme" aimed at supporting customers who are likely to be at risk of fuel poverty, as part of the penalty. </body>

      <body>Lloyds Banking Group is in talks to sell an asset management business to Aberdeen Asset Management. In a statement, Aberdeen said it was discussing a possible strategic partnership with Lloyds Banking Group and a plan to buy Scottish Widows Investment Partnership (SWIP). SWIP currently manages funds of just over £145bn. The purchase would be funded by issuing new shares in Aberdeen to Lloyds, and a deferred cash payment deal. The cash would be conditional on the business's performance over a period of years, Aberdeen said. Aberdeen Asset Management said: "The potential acquisition would add further scale and diversity to the company's product range. "There can be no certainty that the discussions will lead to any transaction or any certainty as to the terms on which any such transaction might proceed. Further statements will be made if and when appropriate." Aberdeen Asset Management said in July that its total funds under management dropped by 1% in the three months to the end of June to £209.6bn. It blamed volatile global markets for the fall. </body>

      <title>Funding boost for Scotland women</title>
      <description>Manager Anna Signeul believes a new funding agreement for the women's game is a "game-changer" for Scotland.</description>

      <body>Manager Anna Signeul believes a new funding agreement for the women's game is a "game-changer" for Scotland. A Scottish Government initiative will provide £200,000 to cover the qualifying period for the 2015 World Cup and allow players to work less. "This is going to have a major impact on the day-to-day lives of these players," Signeul told BBC Scotland. "They are training 15 to 20 hours a week and that is hard to sustain on top of 40 hours work." Scotland have never reached a major tournament, having missed out on the last two European Championship finals at the play-off stage. The majority of Scotland players currently fit their football commitments around full-time work or study and the new financial support will allow for more recovery time as well as more strength and conditioning sessions. "To reduce the work load and be able to rest a little bit more and maybe get some more training time, it's going to make a huge difference," Signeul told BBC Scotland. "Some of the players had already made the decision to work part-time but not everyone can afford to do that." Midfielder Kim Little is one of the few Scotland players to earn a wage from playing and she also welcomes the new injection of money. "I'm very lucky to be at Arsenal and to be able to focus mainly on my football," she said. "It's definitely helped me a lot. "For Scotland to move to the next level, this is definitely the way to go. "You can see the difference funding has made to the England team. They are a very good side now - in the top four in Europe. "In terms of fitness and technique, giving the girls more time to train will improve our national team - without a doubt." Scotland are seeded second in their World Cup qualifying group, behind Sweden, and have opened with high-scoring wins against the Faroe Islands and Bosnia. The Scots host Northern Ireland on Saturday and travel to Poland next week. </body>

      <body>Former director Dave King aims to help build consensus on the best way forward for Rangers. The South Africa-based businessman is in Glasgow for talks with both factions in the power struggle for boardroom control at Ibrox. "I'm here to see whether I am in a position to facilitate taking the club forward," said King. "To get rid of the disunity and lack of harmony both at board level and between the board and the fans." King, who invested £20m when Sir David Murray owned Rangers, has said he wants to lead the club's return to the top tier of Scottish football. On this visit, he will meet with Sandy Easdale, one of just two remaining members of the Rangers board, following a recent spate of resignations. King will also hold talks with the Paul Murray-led group of shareholders, who are seeking to gain influence on the running of the League One club. "I am here for a series of meetings that are at my request," added King on his arrival at Glasgow Airport. "These meetings will remain confidential." King also spoke of his intention to explore the possibility of "assisting in a fund-raising exercise". He said: "We need a funding campaign to make sure that when the club does need money, that it is already in place with the right people at the right cost." </body>

      <body>Ricky Burns is "99%" certain to make a February return against the man who broke his jaw, according to the WBO world lightweight champion's manager. Alex Morrison says a deal is all but done for Mexico's Raymundo Beltran to return to Glasgow for a rematch. Their first meeting ended in a controversial draw last month, with the Beltran camp saying the decision "robbed" their man of the title. It emerged afterwards that Burns had broken his jaw during the fight. The injury was described at the time as "career threatening" by promoter Eddie Hearn. The Coatbridge fighter subsequently had steel plates inserted into his face to repair the damage. Burns returned to light training earlier this month and now Morrison says his fighter is keen to do the right thing. "Ricky feels it's the moral thing to do in giving Beltran another shot," Morrison told BBC Scotland. "He wants to put the record straight after fighting for 10 rounds with a broken jaw in that first fight. "We want it. Beltran wants it and the fans want it. The deal is done. We're 99% there with it and are just waiting for the final confirmation which will happen any day now. "We're looking at early February in Glasgow." </body>

      <description>Taking a trip on the road with most reports of supernatural activity</description>

      <body>It is reputedly the most haunted highway in Scotland. The A75 in Dumfriesshire is said to have had more reports of supernatural activity than any other road in the country. Now a Dumfries-based group of paranormal investigators has collated the stories for a ghostly Halloween road trip on Saturday night. The Kinmount straight on the road is the most notorious spot for sightings. John Hill, of Mostly Ghostly paranormal investigators, said: "So much has happened at this spot. "A quick search of the internet would bring up the A75 as the most haunted road in Scotland and some say Britain. "There are so many different things have happened on this road and been seen by so many different people as well." Mr Hill and Mostly Ghostly founder Kathleen Cronie have researched the road's supernatural history to compile the first ever ghost coach tour of the road. They have some spine-chilling accounts to relate. "There have been screaming hags, eyeless phantoms and a menagerie of unearthly creatures witnessed on this famous road," said Ms Cronie. She said one of the most infamous sightings was made by Derek and Norman Ferguson, in 1962. "They were driving along here and the whole incident began with a large hen flying towards the windscreen of their car," she said. "They then witnessed great cats and various other creatures as well as witnessing a phantom furniture van - which is a bit unusual to say the least." Bob Sturgeon lives beside the A75 and used to run a roadside snack van - at Carrutherstown, near to the sighting "hotspot". "There was very rarely a week went past without somebody telling me about some experience and usually along that Kinmount straight," he said. His business was a frequent early morning refuge for traumatised lorry drivers who had parked overnight in nearby lay-bys. "They weren't the kind of people who would talk to each other," he explained. "They were long-distance drivers - they were well separated - so it wasn't as if there was a group of them gathered in a pub and passed round stories. "Most of these things were all just individual experiences." A common sighting was groups of dejected bedraggled people pulling handcarts or carrying bundles like some medieval camp followers. One man was so shocked, he gave up lorry driving altogether and Mr Sturgeon never saw him again. "He had been parked on the Kinmount straight and he had woken up at the back of three in the morning and he saw this 'parade' of people," he said. "He said that it went on for ages and he had just frozen - he was in an awful state. "It doesn't matter if you blame it on imagination or fact or whatever, it certainly affected him badly." Documented reports of ghosts on this road go back at least 50 years. As well as seeing assorted animals, horsemen and carriages, some drivers have been convinced they have run over people - phantom figures of men, women, couples emerging from the dark. Saturday night's ghost tour is for Halloween but it is likely to be repeated several times a year, for those with the stomach to listen to the stories and the nerve to face the possibility of a spooky experience of their own. </body>

      <title>Electric dreams: Life off the Grid</title>
      <description>Family lives life off the Grid</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-24624883</url>

      <body>In the shadow of a power line undergoing a £600m revamp is a family of six with no connection to the National Grid. A BBC documentary recorded a year in their lives. For 19 years the Pococks have lived off the electricity grid, on a croft at Cougie in Glen Affric in the Highlands. They are fiercely proud of where they live and about being self sufficient. The family grows its own food - they have two dairy cows, pigs, sheep, geese, ducks and hens. Mum Sasha, 36, runs a pony trekking business while her 42-year-old husband, Iain, supplements the household income by gathering and selling scrap metal. The couple's four children - Sarah, Ryan, Ewan and Douglas - help with the running of the croft and pitch in looking after the livestock and the trekking business's 19 horses. The effort to heat and light the crofthouse, however, dominates family life. The croft is not connected to the National Grid and the family gets its electricity from a generator and a small wind turbine. But when diesel levels are low and the wind does not blow, the TV and domestic appliances are out of action and the children have to do their homework by candlelight and head torches. With a lack of power comes great responsibility. Iain carries out regular maintenance to the diesel generator and wind turbine, while the children spend a cold and wet Saturday gathering firewood. Tonnes of timber are needed to keep the house warm in winter. Iain's mother, Val, also lives on the croft. She and her family moved from Cardiff to Cougie in 1962 seeking an alternative to city life. Sixty percent of her pension goes on paying for fuel. The Pococks say they cannot get grants to install a larger turbine or solar panels because the funding requires surplus power to be exported to the Grid. Ironically, the croft is close to a massive multi-million pound electricity project. Energy giant SSE is upgrading the 137-mile (220km) Beauly to Denny transmission circuit. The 400,000-volt line will triple the capacity of the existing system, and eventually transmit vast amounts of energy from planned renewable power schemes in the Highlands to central Scotland. Six hundred new towers are being built - a reduction of 200 on the existing number. However, some towers are taller and reach heights of 65m (213ft). Opponents to the upgrade have complained that the new towers will spoil mountain landscapes. The project is expected to be completed in 2014 at an estimated cost of £600m. Sasha says the upgraded line is a blot on the landscape and, in return for having to live with it, her family should get some help getting mains electricity. "We live here in a croft at the end of the glen in the middle of nowhere, and we love it," she says. "We chose to live here. It's a great place to raise a family." But while she and her family thrive in the glen's wild, wide open spaces, Sasha is desperate for a reliable source of power. Seeing work being done to the Beauly-Denny line only fuels her quest for it. Tending to a ewe and her young lambs on a hillside overlooking the croft, Sasha's eldest child Sarah admits some people frown at her family's lifestyle. She said: "One of my friends goes to me: 'Oi, you don't look like a hillbilly, but you live like one'. And I go 'yeah, I suppose you could say that, but we're not quite though'." For Sarah there is a big distraction from the family's electric dreams. She has left school for university and swapped Glen Affric's quiet dark nights for the bright lights of Edinburgh. Power to the Pococks; A year in the life of a crofting family is a Timeline Films production. It will be shown on Thursday on BBC Two Scotland from 21:00. </body>

They also want to know your opinions on the way universities and colleges operate, their funding, admissions policy and research resourcing. Do you think independence would be good or bad for post-school education in Scotland? Or does the status quo offer a weaker or stronger future for the tertiary education sector? If you would like to discuss these and other issues with an invited panel of guests, please fill in the application below. The special programme will be recorded on Monday, 28 October, at BBC Scotland's Glasgow headquarters. Participants will need to be available from 17:45 to 20:30. Guidelines require the BBC to reflect a broad range of views. To help us do this, we will ask all members of the audience whether they are associated with a political party, if they already have a view on the referendum and where in the British Isles they are from. Voters in Scotland will go to the polls on Thursday, 18 September, next year when they will be asked the straight yes/no question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?" </body>

      <body>The Scottish Sun says axed Grangemouth staff have been thrown a 24-hour lifeline after bosses agreed to review a decision to shut the plant. According to the Daily Record, the future of Scotland's biggest industrial site lies in the hands of just one man, Ineos founder Jim Ratcliffe. Billionaire Ratcliffe, says the Herald, has not commented on Unite's u-turn over the ultimatum that its 800 workers must accept a wage freeze and the end of their final salary pension scheme. The Scotsman reports that the Ineos chairman is expected to decide today whether to revive a rescue deal for the plant. In the Press and Journal, the last survivor to escape from the wreckage of a helicopter which plunged into the North Sea reveals he still has nightmares about the disaster. </body>

      <title>US spying 'may harm terror fight'</title>
      <description>EU leaders meeting in Brussels say distrust of the US over spying could harm intelligence-gathering in the fight against terrorism.</description>

      <body>EU leaders meeting in Brussels say distrust of the US over spying could harm the fight against terrorism. A statement agreed by the leaders says that "a lack of trust could prejudice" intelligence-gathering co-operation. France and Germany are pushing for talks with the US to find a new "understanding" by the year's end. A number of allegations against US intelligence agents have surfaced this week, including the bugging of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone. In addition there have been claims that the US National Security Agency (NSA) monitored millions of French telephone calls. On Thursday, the UK's Guardian newspaper also reported that it had obtained a confidential memo from the NSA suggesting it had monitored the phones of 35 world leaders. The latest revelations have been sourced to US whistleblower Edward Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who fled the country earlier this year and is now in Russia. They have overshadowed other issues at the EU summit in Brussels, including the Mediterranean migration problem, which frames the agenda of Friday's talks. Italian authorities said they had intercepted some 800 migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean as the EU leaders prepared to meet. The statement of heads of state or government, released on Friday, reflects the EU leaders' conclusions following their talks on Thursday. It says the recent intelligence issues had raised "deep concerns" among European citizens. The statement says the leaders "underlined the close relationship between Europe and the USA and the value of that partnership". It continues: "[The leaders] stressed that intelligence-gathering is a vital element in the fight against terrorism." And it went on: "A lack of trust could prejudice the necessary cooperation in the field of intelligence-gathering." Belgian Prime Minister Elio di Rupo said: "The objective must remain the same - to fight against terrorism but also respect privacy. "Everyone can understand the need for exceptional measures given the danger of terrorism... but we are not in the position where we should spy on each other." Talks among the EU leaders had continued late into Thursday night. Speaking afterwards, Mrs Merkel said: "We need trust among allies and partners. Such trust now has to be built anew. "The United States of America and Europe face common challenges. We are allies. But such an alliance can only be built on trust. That's why I repeat again: spying among friends, that cannot be." Germany and France said they were proposing talks with the US to settle the row by the end of the year. The leaders' statement said: "The heads of state or government took note of the intention of France and Germany to seek bilateral talks with the USA with the aim of finding before the end of the year an understanding on mutual relations in that field. "They noted that other EU countries are welcome to join this initiative." French President Francois Hollande said on Friday; "What is at stake is preserving our relations with the United States." BBC Europe editor Gavin Hewitt says the French and Germans are looking for a new set of rules with a "no spying pact" at the core. He says this would mirror an arrangement the United States has had with Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada since just after World War II. That secret intelligence-sharing operation is known as Five Eyes. EU President Herman Van Rompuy accepted the UK had "a special relationship" with the US, but said Britain was "completely on board with this text". UK PM David Cameron has yet to comment. But a number of other leaders have indicated their support for the French and German position. Finnish PM Jyrki Katainen said: "We have to talk together with the Americans, and try to find some sort of code of conduct [on] how to cooperate on this kind of issue in the future." Swedish PM Fredrik Reinfeldt said it was "completely unacceptable" to eavesdrop on the leader of an ally, a view echoed by Italian PM Enrico Letta, who added: "We want the truth." But the BBC's Chris Morris in Brussels says that, despite the widespread anger about American spying, Mrs Merkel opposed a suggestion to suspend trade talks with the United States - and on that point, the UK will be relieved. Other leaders signalled the need to move on. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said: "The main thing is that we look to the future. The trans-Atlantic partnership was, and is, important." Mrs Merkel had raised her concerns with US President Barack Obama in a call on Wednesday. White House spokesman Jay Carney later said Mr Obama had assured Mrs Merkel that her phone was not being listened to now and would not be in the future. However, his statement left open the question of whether calls had been listened to in the past. </body>

      <title>ICC rules against Kenya's Ruto</title>
      <description>The International Criminal Court tells Kenya's deputy president he must attend most of his trial, overturning an earlier decision.</description>

      <body>The International Criminal Court has told Kenya's Deputy President William Ruto he must attend most of his trial on charges of crimes against humanity. Prosecutors had appealed against an earlier decision which would have let him spend most of his time in Kenya. While he must appear at most of his trial, the court ruled he can be excused on a "case by case" basis. Mr Ruto's lawyers argued he was needed in Kenya after the attack by Islamist militants on the Westgate centre. He denies responsibility for post-election violence in 2007 and 2008. An estimated 1,200 people were killed in the ethnic bloodshed and about 600,000 fled their homes. His lawyers argued that justice could be met in his absence. At least 67 people were killed when militants believed to be from the Somali al-Shabab group stormed the shopping centre last month. In their ruling on Friday, judges were critical of the initial decision to give the deputy president a "blanket excusal" before the trial had even commenced. He will be allowed to apply to miss portions of the case but his absence will only be allowed when it is absolutely necessary. The BBC's Anna Holligan in The Hague says that the ruling reinforces the power of the ICC to hold the most powerful to account. However, Friday's ruling could deepen tensions between the court and African leaders who accuse it of unfairly targeting their continent, correspondents say. Mr Ruto has, so far, attended much of his case. Friday's judgement could also affect the trial of Kenyan President Uhuru, whose trial on similar charges is scheduled to start next month. The prosecution is still considering whether to appeal against a decision to allow the president to miss parts of his trial. Mr Kenyatta argued that attending the trial in The Hague would prevent him from governing the country. Our correspondent says that Mr Ruto, Mr Kenyatta and journalist Joshua Sang comprise the "Big Three" accused of instigating and co-ordinating the post-election killings in which innocent people including women and children were shot and hacked to death. But our correspondent says that was six years ago, and today Kenya is on the frontline of the battle against the global threat posed by al-Qaeda and its global affiliates. Mr Ruto's trial began in September. The deputy president is the first serving government official to stand trial in an international court. Many experts in international law believe that his case reflects the apparently incompatible demands of historical restorative justice versus future global security. Experts believe that the ICC is in an impossible position, fighting against the tide of international pressure to placate the government in Nairobi. </body>

      <title>Women gain as gender gap 'narrows'</title>
      <description>The gender gap is narrowing across the world, a World Economic Forum report suggests, with Nordic countries leading the way but Arab nations lagging behind.</description>

      <body>The gap between men and women has narrowed slightly in the past year in most countries, according to a World Economic Forum (WEF) report. Iceland, Finland and Norway top the list of 136 nations, based on political participation, economic equality and rights like education and health. The Middle East and North Africa were the only regions not to improve in the past year, with Yemen at the bottom. The Philippines and Nicaragua both feature in the top 10. The WEF has produced the report annually for the past eight years. The release of this year's edition comes as the BBC rounds off a month-long focus on women and gender around the world with a major event at Broadcasting House in London. One hundred women from all around the world are gathering for a day of debate and discussion as the 100 Women season comes to an end. Iceland's position at the top of the WEF rankings was the fifth year in a row the country has been named the world's most equal. Report founder and co-author Saadia Zahidi told the BBC that since the WEF began compiling the index in 2006, 80% of countries had made progress. "What's worrying though is that 20% of countries have made no progress or are falling behind," she said. She singled out the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia as countries that had invested in education and health, but had not integrated women into the economy. Nadia al-Sakkaf, editor of the English-language Yemen Times, in London for the 100 Women conference, told the BBC that she had stopped counting the years her country had languished at the bottom of the equality list. "It comes down to everyday life. We had three women running for president in 2006. We have lots of women in senior positions," she said. "But our levels of maternal mortality are very high, and 35% of girls aged 6-14 years old are not in school." Human capital Saadia Zahidi of the WEF said that by contrast many sub-Saharan countries had not invested in women, but through necessity they played a major role in the economy. Nordic countries continued to lead the way because they had a long history of investing in people, she said. "They are small economies with small populations; they recognise that talent matters, and that talent has to be men and women. Overall, the report, entitled Global Gender Gap Report 2013, found Iceland to be the most advanced country in the world in terms of gender equality for the fifth year running. Iceland, Finland (second), Norway (third) and Sweden (fourth) had all closed over 80% of the gender gap, where 100% would represent full equality. The highest-ranked Asian nation was the Philippines (fifth), praised for its success in health, education and economic participation. Asia's major economies performed poorly, with China in 69th place and Japan 105th. Nicaragua in 10th place was the highest positioned country in North and South America, and was praised for a "strong performance" in terms of political empowerment. Among major world economies Germany ranked 14th (down one), the UK held its position at 18, with Canada at 20 and the United States 23rd. On matters of health and survival, the report finds that 96% of the gap has now closed. In terms of education, the global gender gap is 93% closed, with 25 countries now judged to deliver equal treatment to boys and girls at school. It is a different picture on the core issue of economic equality, where the gender gap has closed by 60%. In developing and developed countries alike, women's presence in economic leadership positions is limited. And while women have made small gains in political representation - 2% this year - only 21% of that global gender gap has closed Ms Zahidi said the idea of the report was not to remind poor countries that they had fewer opportunities than rich countries, but to give them a tool to improve the situation. "Women make up one half of the human capital available to any economy and any company; if that talent isn't integrated, that is going to be a loss for both women and men," she said. </body>

      <title>North Korea returns six S Koreans</title>
      <description>North Korea returns six South Korean men, aged between 27 and 67, to their homeland, South Korean officials say, in a rare handover.</description>

      <body>North Korea has returned six South Korean men to their homeland, South Korean officials say, in a rare move. The men, between the ages of 27 and 67, were handed over on Friday at the truce village of Panmunjom, on the border between the two countries. Their names were not released and details surrounding their detention in the North remain unclear. The two Koreas remain technically at war, as the 1950-53 conflict ended in an armistice and not a peace treaty. Pyongyang's Red Cross informed Seoul that the men would be handed back via Panmunjom on Thursday, a statement from South Korea's Unification Ministry said. Officials said the group would be taken to South Korea's spy agency to face questions over their presence in North Korea. The South Korean government said that at first glance, the men were not on the list of those abducted by the North. One possibility is that they may have crossed into North Korea illegally from China, the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul says. Unofficial travel to North Korea by private citizens from South Korea is illegal, Pyongyang's state news agency announced the detention of several unnamed South Korean nationals in 2010 and there is speculation that they may be among those returned, our correspondent adds. The move by North Korea is seen as a gesture of reconciliation following the cancellation of reunions for families split by the division of the Korean peninsula at the end of the Korean War which were planned for last month. Tensions between the two Koreas rose earlier this year, after North Korea's third nuclear test in February. </body>

      <title>China court rejects Bo Xilai appeal</title>
      <description>A high court in China has rejected the appeal of top politician Bo Xilai, jailed for life for bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power.</description>

      <body>A Chinese court has rejected the appeal of former politician Bo Xilai and upheld his life sentence for bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power. The former Chongqing Communist Party leader was convicted of the charges in September. He was removed from office in 2012 amid a scandal which saw his wife convicted of a British businessman's murder. The high court in Shandong, the province where Bo's trial was held, accepted his appeal earlier this month. "The facts of the first instance verdict are clear, the evidence is reliable, sufficient and the sentence is appropriate," the high court said in its ruling, which was posted on its website. "The court rules as follows: reject the appeal, uphold the original verdict. This verdict is the final ruling." The hearing appeared to have been brief, with the verdict coming about an hour after a convoy believed to be carrying Bo was seen arriving at the court. Footage from state broadcaster CCTV showed Bo's elder son, Li Wangzhi, in court with other relatives. Bo only receives one chance to appeal and his sentence is now final. He could submit a complaint to the Supreme People's Court in Beijing, but the vast majority of such complaints are rejected and do not result in another trial, reports the BBC's Celia Hatton in Beijing. Correspondents said few expected Bo's conviction to be overturned. The courts are controlled by the ruling Communist Party, from which Bo was expelled from last year. Bo Xilai, the charismatic former party chief in the city of Chongqing in south-western China, was a member of the powerful politburo - one of the 25 most senior party officials in the country. But he was removed from office last year amid a scandal which began when his deputy, Wang Lijun, sought refuge in the US consulate in Chengdu. The incident prompted an investigation into the death of British businessman Neil Heywood. Bo Xilai's wife, Gu Kailai, was eventually convicted of Mr Heywood's murder - a crime caused, the court said, by a financial dispute. Wang was also jailed for 15 years for helping Gu cover up the murder. Bo himself was found guilty of taking bribes amounting to 20m yuan ($3.3m, £2m) either personally or through his family. He was also accused of abusing his office by using his position to cover up for his wife's crime. Bo's supporters, however, believe he is the victim of a political purge. His downfall came as China prepared for its once-in-a-decade leadership transfer, as one generation of leaders made way for the next. Bo had been seen as a candidate for the very top, until his fall from grace. It was the biggest political shake-up to hit China's ruling elite in decades. The final verdict in the Bo case comes weeks before the Communist Party holds a major meeting in November to set economic policy. </body>

      <title>Madagascar voters go to the polls</title>
      <description>Madagascar voters go to the polls in the first election since the 2009 military-backed takeover – with reports of some trouble outside the capital.</description>

      <body>Voters in Madagascar are going to the polls in the first election since the 2009 military-backed takeover. Thirty-three candidates are contesting the election, which has been postponed three times this year. Two front-runners are competing with a similar pledge to rebuild the island's economy after years of unrest. Voting has been orderly in the capital but a local official was killed in an attack on a polling station in the south-western town of Benenitra. Another person was kidnapped from a polling station in Bezaha, elsewhere in the south, an interior ministry source told the AFP news agency. More than 92% of the country's 21 million people live on less than $2 (£1.2) a day, according to the World Bank. The two front-runners, Hery Martial Rakotoarimanana Rajaonarimampianina and Richard Jean-Louis Robinson, are both pledging to rebuild Madagascar's economy. President Andry Rajoelina ousted Marc Ravalomanana from power in 2009, plunging the island nation into political turmoil and leaving the country isolated by the international community and deprived of foreign aid. After seizing power, Mr Rajoelina announced that there would be a new constitution and elections within 24 months. In May 2009 it was agreed that all former presidents would be allowed to stand in the election. However, these failed to take place in 2009 or 2010. After casting his vote in the capital, Antananarivo, Mr Rajoelina said that it was time Madagascar "returned to the constitutional order", the Associated Press news agency reports. "The crisis has lasted too long,'' he is quoted as saying. In January this year Mr Rajoelina and Mr Ravalomanana both agreed not to stand in the polls, in line with a plan by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), a regional bloc that Madagascar belongs to. The first round of this election was set to take place in July 2013 but was pushed back to August because Mr Ravalomanana's wife and former first lady, Lalao - and then Mr Rajoelina himself - decided to run, prompting donors to suspend financing for the poll. Mr Rajoelina and Lalao Ravalomanana were then barred from standing and the electoral court also struck former President Didier Ratsiraka from the list of candidates after the three refused to withdraw. The African Union had said it would not recognise the results if any of the three were declared the winner. The electoral commission then set the elections for 25 October. According to the local news website Orange, security officials say the situation is under control in Benenitra, where the official, a district chief, was killed and helicopters are flying over southern parts of the island. As well as the trouble reported in the south of the Indian Ocean island, a polling station was also burnt down in the northern Tsaratanana district, the interior ministry source told AFP. Mr Rajaonarimampianina, a former finance minister in the transitional government, says he aims to help the unemployed, build infrastructure to improve agriculture, reform the education system and make Madagascar a strong democracy. Mr Robinson says that his electoral programme will draw heavily on a new version of Mr Ravalomanana's Madagascar Action Plan (MAP) to help rebuild society and also rejuvenate the ailing tourism industry. The polls will be run by the Independent National Electoral Commission of the Transition (Cenit) - an independent electoral body funded by the United Nations. No firm date has been set to announce the results but if no candidate receives more than 50% of the votes cast, a second round will be held on 20 December, along with the parliamentary elections. Cenit says there are 7,697,382 registered voters and 20,115 polling stations in Madagascar, a country the size of France with a scattered population. </body>

      <title>Syria: Polio epidemic fears grow</title>
      <description>The number of suspected cases of polio among children in Syria is believed to have risen sharply, with at least 22 people now thought to be suffering from the disease, health officials say.</description>

      <body>At least 22 people - most of them babies and toddlers - are now believed to have contracted polio in Syria, the World Health Organization has reported. If confirmed, it would be the first outbreak of the disease there in 14 years. Syria's Health Ministry began an immunisation drive on Thursday. Before Syria's civil war began in 2011, some 95% of children were vaccinated against the disease. Now, Unicef estimates 500,000 children have not been immunised. WHO said the suspected outbreak centres on the eastern province of Deir Ezzor. "There is a cluster of 22 acute flaccid paralysis cases that is being investigated in that area," WHO spokesman Oliver Rosenbauer told Reuters news agency. "Everybody is treating this as an outbreak and is in outbreak response mode." Two cases have already been confirmed by laboratory tests while the WHO expects final laboratory confirmation on the remaining 20 cases next week. There are more than 100,000 children, all under age five, now at risk of polio in Deir Ezzor province alone, which has been caught in fierce battles between Syrian government forces and opposition fighters. The city of Deir Ezzor remains partially controlled by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, while the countryside is in the hands of the opposition. The WHO is now working with the UN, Syria's Health Ministry and other agencies on a mass immunisation programme. But it is expected to be a difficult undertaking, says the BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva, given the widespread insecurity and estimates that over half of Syria's medical professionals have left the country. More than four million Syrians have been displaced internally by the conflict and generally live in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. The WHO has already reported increases in cases of measles, typhoid and hepatitis A. Aid agencies are also developing emergency immunisation plans for Syrian refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Egypt. "Obviously, we're extremely worried about the situation," Simon Ingram, a spokesman for Unicef's operations in the Middle East, told the BBC. "People are flooding across borders in an uncontrolled manner and this increases the possibilities and means by which the virus can spread." The highly contagious disease is most often spread by consuming food or liquid contaminated with faeces. Polio has been largely eradicated in developed countries but remains endemic in Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Worldwide, polio cases have fallen from an estimated 350,000 at the start of a WHO-led immunisation campaign in 1988 to just 223 reported cases last year. There is no known cure, though a series of vaccinations can confer immunity. Young children are particularly susceptible to paralytic polio, the most serious form of the disease. </body>

      <title>Czech poll bids to end uncertainty</title>
      <description>Voters in the Czech Republic are set to go to the polls to try to elect a new government after months without a proper administration.</description>

      <body>Czech voters are going to the polls to try to elect a new government after months without a proper administration. The last elected government collapsed in June amid a corruption scandal. A subsequent attempt to form a caretaker government failed because it could not win a vote of confidence. Opinion polls suggest the Social Democrats will take about 25% and win, but it is not clear if they will be able to form a stable coalition. Voting takes place over two days. Polling stations open from 14:00 local time (12:00 GMT) on Friday until 22:00, and then from 08:00 to 14:00 on Saturday. If they win, the Social Democrats may team up with the Communists, who - opinion polls suggest - are on about 18%. Otherwise, Social Democrat leader Bohuslav Sobotka may try to survive in a minority government. In third place is a new party led by billionaire businessman Andrej Babis. He may be another coalition option for the Social Democrats, many of whom are dismayed at the prospect of helping the Communists back to power two decades after they were forced out. Support for the centre-right has collapsed since the coalition formed by Petr Necas after the 2010 elections imploded. His government fell as the result of a corruption and abuse-of-power scandal involving the prime minister's chief-of-staff. Czechs had also tired of its austerity programme, amid an 18-month recession that ended earlier this year. Another factor in the election is the role of President Milos Zeman. A former member of the Social Democrats, he has fallen out with the party. Critics fear that if the election result is inconclusive, he may take advantage to pursue his alleged goal of moving power from parliament to the presidency. One opponent, artist David Cerny, made his protest visible this week by floating a huge purple middle finger along the Vltava river in front of the presidential castle. </body>

      <body>An elderly Australian couple were unwittingly used as drug mules in a ruse involving a free trip to Canada, Australian police have revealed. The couple, from Perth, were told they had won a week-long trip, with flights, hotel and new luggage included. But when they landed back in Perth, they told customs officials they feared something was wrong with their luggage. Officials subsequently found 3.5kg (8 pounds) of methamphetamine in the lining of each bag. The incident happened on 13 October. A 38-year-old man was arrested later that day at Perth airport and has since been charged with drug-related offences. Local reports put the value of the drugs at A$7m ($6.7m, £4.1m) and said police believed the suitcases were swapped while the couple, aged 72 and 64, were in Canada. In a statement, police said the subsequent investigation had revealed "a complex and highly-organised scam in which older Australians appear to be targeted by a bogus Canadian-based tour company identifying itself as 'AUSCAN Tours'". "The organisers of this scam went to great lengths to provide a facade of legitimacy," Perth Airport Police Commander David Bachi said. "Thankfully the travellers contacted Customs and didn't dismiss their concerns, allowing us to make the arrest." </body>

      <body>Eight civilians have been injured after Pakistani troops fired guns and mortar shells at border posts in Indian-administered Kashmir, officials say. Two children were among those wounded, a Border Security Force official said. Pakistan said the ceasefire violations were "a matter of great concern", but they had no information or comment about the latest incident. In recent months, India and Pakistan have accused each other of unprovoked firing along the disputed border. India says there have been nearly 200 violations of the decade-long ceasefire agreement since the beginning of this year. On Wednesday morning, India said a paramilitary soldier was killed and many others were injured in firing overnight. Earlier this month, the Indian army said it had fought gun battles with "30 to 40 Pakistan-backed militants" who had tried to infiltrate into India. Officials said the militants made several attempts to enter the Keran area and that at least eight of them died in clashes over the last two weeks. Pakistan dismissed as "baseless" reports of infiltration from its soil. "In the overnight firing from across the border eight civilians, including two children, have been injured in the general area of Kanachak near the international border in the Jammu region," senior BSF official Darmindar Parrikh told the BBC. Officials accused Pakistani troops of shelling 17 border posts and hamlets in Jammu and Samba districts overnight. They said India responded and the exchanges continued until early Friday morning. On Friday, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah visited the injured in the hospital. Reports say hundreds of villagers have fled their homes in border areas in recent days due to repeated firing from Pakistan. In Islamabad, foreign ministry spokesman Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry said he had no information or comment on the latest exchange of firing, but added that Pakistani troops did not fire indiscriminately and emphasised that Pakistan has no interest in creating problems along the border, reports Associated Press. "Our troops have a policy. We will not indulge in firing first. But if we are fired upon we will give a responsible and effective response," he added. The increased volatility along the border comes 10 years after the two countries agreed a ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border that divides Kashmir between them. In September, the prime ministers of the two countries met in New York and agreed to maintain peace on the border, but correspondents say their pledge seems to have made little difference on the ground. Earlier this week, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif vowed to go the "extra mile" to make peace with India, saying while on a trip to the US that the two countries can resolve all issues including Kashmir through dialogue. </body>

      <body>Singer Manolo Escobar, whose best-selling track Y Viva Espana became part of Spain's cultural identity in the 1970s, has died aged 82. Escobar died at home in the town of Benidorm surrounded by his family, after a long fight against cancer. He was "a symbol who lived in the musical landscape of Spaniards for half a century," Spain's culture minister, Jose Ignacio Wert, said in a statement. "Music is my life," Escobar said this month. "I will never surrender." "I am happy because I have work and because, moreover, people are still prepared to pay to see me on stage," the singer said in an interview with Spanish newspaper ABC. "I want to return to a few of the places I have been to in my career of more than 50 years and say goodbye for good. I will sing one more time in each one so that I don't go back," he added. Born in a small village outside Almeria in October 1931, Escobar had a huge following in Spain in the 1960s and 1970s with hits such as El Porompompero and Mi Carro. A well-known personality thanks to his television show Canta Manolo Escobar, he also starred in films including The Guerrillas and Father Manolo, in which he played a singing priest. But it was the success of Y Viva Espana, in 1973, that made him an international star. The track was based on Eviva Espana, the 1971 song written by Belgian duo Leo Rozenstraten and Leo Caerts, and performed, in Dutch, by Samantha. Escobar's best-selling single - released to coincide with Spain's transition from dictatorship to democracy and a boom in international tourism - sold an estimated six million copies. In 1974, the track was covered by Swedish singer Sylvia Vrethammar, whose English version reached number four in the UK Singles Chart. One of Escobar's last big acts was in July 2010 when he sang with the Spanish football team to celebrate their victory in the World Cup in South Africa. He announced his retirement from music at the end of 2012 after 50 years on the stage. Last month, he had to cancel the final dates of his farewell tour after falling ill. He was undergoing treatment, reportedly for colon cancer, at Benidorm's Hospital Clinica, but is understood to have left on Tuesday. He died at home two days later. Escobar leaves a wife, Anita, and one daughter, Vanessa. </body>

      <body>A former National Security Agency (NSA) chief giving off-the-record interviews on a high-speed train has had his remarks reported live on Twitter. General Michael Hayden was talking off-the-record to journalists by phone when he was overheard by another passenger, a former political activist. Tom Matzzie said he waited half an hour before live-tweeting comments about US renditions and a "famous BlackBerry". The comments went viral on news websites and late-night television. Gen Hayden, who was alerted to the Twitter feed within about 15 minutes, then offered an interview to Mr Matzzie, who is now head of a company called Ethical Electric. "I just had a very nice conversation with Michael Hayden. He was a gentleman and we disagree," Mr Matzzie later tweeted. The two men were on a high-speed Acela train travelling from Washington, DC to New York late on Thursday afternoon. Mr Matzzie began tweeting details of the conversations from what he said was a distance of 8ft (about 2.4m) away. "On Acela listening to former NSA spy boss Michael Hayden give 'off record' interviews. I feel like I'm in the NSA. Except I'm in public," Mr Matzzie's Twitter feed read. The National Security Agency has come under intense criticism after revelations by ex-CIA contractor Edward Snowden that US intelligence conducted extensive web and phone surveillance on targets at home and abroad. Mr Snowden now faces espionage charges in the US and has been granted temporary asylum in Russia. Gen Hayden has defended his former agency's operations in the past and Mr Matzzie wrote that Thursday's interviews were also focused on NSA surveillance of foreign allies. As the former head of MoveOn.org Political Action, Mr Matzzie once campaigned against the US-led war in Iraq. He made clear his own feelings about the former NSA and CIA chief with a tweet reading, "There is a faint smell of sulfur on the train." He said Gen Hayden asked journalists to refer to him as a "former senior administration official" for comments described as "disparaging" to President Barack Obama's administration. Gen Hayden later gave a statement to the Reuters news agency saying he "didn't criticise" the president. "I actually said these are very difficult issues. I said I had political guidance, too, that limited the things that I did when I was director of NSA. Now that political guidance is going to be more robust. It wasn't a criticism," Gen Hayden said. </body>

      <title>Canada senator 'lied' in expense row</title>
      <description>Canadian Conservative Senator Marjory LeBreton accuses fellow Tory Senator Mike Duffy of lying in order to avoid punishment in a growing expenses row.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24663213</url>

      <body>A Canadian Conservative Party senator has accused another senator embroiled in an expenses row of lying in order to avoid political repercussions. Senator Marjory LeBreton says Mike Duffy spoke a "blatant falsehood". Mr Duffy, Pamela Wallin and Patrick Brazeau face suspension from the Senate without pay over accusations they claimed improper expenses. Mr Duffy has accused Conservative PM Stephen Harper's office of attempting to cover up the matter. On Thursday, Ms LeBreton spoke as the Senate debated motions to suspend Conservatives Mr Duffy, Ms Wallin and Mr Brazeau. "There is no joy in having this whole situation before us," she said, speaking in favour of the suspensions. Days earlier, Mr Duffy accused Mr Harper's office of wielding "bribery, threats and extortion" in an effort to cover up a growing expenses row. Mr Duffy said Mr Harper's office sought to force him to repay taxpayer-reimbursed expenses that Mr Duffy believed were properly claimed. Ms LeBreton challenged the allegation: "The story that Senator Duffy spun in this place is not based in facts and it certainly leaves open to question what he was talking about and what he was thinking." She said Mr Duffy spoke a "blatant falsehood" in order to avoid being expelled from the Senate over the expenses matter. On Wednesday, Mr Harper denied involvement in the affair, telling the House of Commons he had been unaware of Mr Duffy's activities. Canadian senators are appointed by the governor general of Canada - the Queen's representative - on the advice of the prime minister. They typically join either the government caucus or the opposition caucus, or sit as independents. Mr Duffy has been accused of seeking reimbursement for expenses associated with a cottage in his home province of Prince Edward Island despite actually residing primarily in Ottawa, the national capital. He has argued the expense claims were within government guidelines for the reimbursement of senators who live outside Ottawa but must maintain a second home there. Mr Duffy has said Mr Harper ordered him to repay the government after months of negative publicity. But he declined, arguing that to pay back money to which he was entitled would damage his reputation. He then accused Mr Harper's office of "bribery, threats and extortion", and said Mr Harper threatened to force him from his Senate seat in order to cover up the row. Mr Duffy's lawyer says the prime minister's office sought a way to repay the 90,000 Canadian dollars ($86,336; £53,292) it said Mr Duffy owed the taxpayers in order to put an end to the potentially damaging row. Mr Duffy reportedly agreed in order to avoid an audit. Mr Harper's chief of staff Nigel Wright said in May that he provided the money to Mr Duffy, prompting an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Mr Wright later resigned his post. "Any assertion that I was in any way consulted or had any knowledge of Mr Wright's payment to Mr Duffy is categorically false," Mr Harper later told the media. "Had I known about it, I would not have permitted it." Mr Duffy, Ms Wallin and Mr Brazeau have left the Conservative Senate caucus after audits uncovered what officials labelled "troubling" expenses claims. The government leader in the Senate Claude Carignan later recommended that the three be suspended, saying the move was needed "to protect the dignity and reputation of the Senate". While Ms LeBreton spoke in favour of the suspension, Conservative Senator Donald Plett defended his three colleagues, arguing the punishment would set a precedent enabling the Senate to punish merely unpopular members. Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau, meanwhile, has sought to pin the row on Mr Harper. "A leader takes responsibility when things go wrong and this prime minister has consistently avoided taking any responsibility for this sordid mess," Mr Trudeau said. But the Liberal Party has also been touched by the expenses row. Ex-Liberal Senator Mac Harb left the chamber in August, dropping a dispute of an order that he repay 231,000 Canadian dollars ($220,000; £141,000) in expense reimbursements deemed improper. </body>

      <title>US healthcare IT contractors grilled</title>
      <description>Contractors who worked on the much-maligned US healthcare website tell lawmakers that the Obama administration must share the blame for its glitches.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24658892</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70692000/jpg/_70692787_70692685.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Contractors who worked on the much-maligned US healthcare website have told lawmakers the Obama administration must share the blame for its glitches. One senior executive told a congressional panel that the federal government was "the ultimate responsible party". The panel also heard that two contractors wanted more testing before the 1 October launch of the website. The Obama administration is in damage-control mode over the troubled rollout. At a health centre in Arizona on Thursday, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said technicians and administration officials were working "24-7" to fix glitches in the website and its technical underpinnings. And she dismissed Republicans' calls for her to step down over the problematic healthcare rollout, saying those critics "do not want this programme to work in this first place". Amid the fallout, the White House late on Wednesday announced it would push back by six weeks the healthcare law's requirement for individuals to buy insurance or face a tax penalty. Thursday's testimony before the House energy and commerce committee began with Republican legislators arguing that the healthcare.gov website flaws were part of wider problems in the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which is commonly known as Obamacare. "The American people deserve something that works, or start over," Representative Tim Murphy said, suggesting that the law be suspended until the problems are fixed. The website is one part of the larger law, which includes increased requirements for insurance firms, a requirement that individuals carry insurance or pay a tax penalty, and subsidies for those who qualify to assist in the cost of the insurance. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office previously said about seven million people would gain coverage through the federal website and others run by some states during the first year of operation. Democrats have lamented the technical issues but have defended the law, while criticising Republican attempts to undermine it. "Republicans don't have clean hands coming here," Democratic Representative Frank Pallone said. The website's glitches were politically overshadowed by a 16-day government shutdown, which began after Republicans tried to gut the law through budgetary brinkmanship in Congress. On Thursday, Cheryl Campbell, a senior vice-president of the Canadian-firm CGI, which created the front-end portion of the website, said that overwhelming interest from consumers had triggered the website problems. "No amount of testing within reasonable time limits can adequately replicate a live environment of this nature" Ms Campbell said. But she also blamed administration officials, saying the health department should have served as the "quarterback" on the project and was the "ultimate responsible party for the end-to-end performance". Andy Slavitt of QSSI, which created several elements of the online healthcare exchange, said a late decision to require consumers to create accounts before they could browse insurance plans contributed to the slow, malfunctioning website. "This may have driven higher simultaneous usage of the registration system that wouldn't have occurred if consumers could window-shop anonymously," Mr Slavitt said. Republican Representative Joe Pitts questioned this decision, pointing out that "window-shopping" was widely used in e-commerce, including in another government healthcare website for the elderly. "Who made that decision? When was it made? Why was it made?" Mr Pitts asked during the hearing. Republican Representative Fred Upton said the Obama administration "appears allergic to transparency and continues to withhold enrolment figures" for the healthcare website. "We still don't know the real picture," he said. "This is not about blame - this is about accountability, transparency, and fairness for the American public." And some Democrats on the panel said they were frustrated with both the government's and contractors' handling of the situation. Representative Anna Eshoo, a Democrat who represents the Silicon Valley area, said it was a "lame excuse" to blame the website's problems on a crush of visitors. "Amazon and eBay don't crash the week before Christmas," Ms Eshoo said. "ProFlowers doesn't crash on Valentine's Day." And Democratic Congresswoman Diana DeGette said: "These problems need to be fixed, and they need to be fixed fast." Ms Sebelius and other government officials are set to testify in front of legislators in a hearing next week. She was ridiculed earlier this month during an appearance on The Daily Show when the host Jon Stewart pulled out a laptop and said: "I'm going try and download every movie ever made, and you're going to try and sign up for Obamacare and we'll see which happens first." In response to the outcry over the technical issues, the administration will begin daily status briefings on the system, starting on Thursday. On Wednesday, US health officials admitted the online system did not get enough testing before going live on 1 October, especially at higher volumes. The health law also allowed individual states to set up their own online insurance exchanges. Fourteen states and the District of Columbia went with this option - those websites have not reported so many problems. </body>

      <title>Mexico factory hit by deadly blast</title>
      <description>A huge explosion and fire at a sweet factory in the northern Mexico city of Ciudad Juarez kills at least one person and injures dozens.</description>

      <body>At least one person has died and dozens more are injured in an explosion and fire that tore through a sweet factory in northern Mexico. A boiler is believed to have exploded in the Dulces Blueberry factory at an industrial park in Ciudad Juarez, causing the ceiling to collapse. About 300 people were said to be in the factory at the time and several are still unaccounted for. Fire crews and about 30 ambulances were at the scene. Ciudad Juarez Civil Protection Director Fernando Mota said firefighters found a body inside the factory and that six of the injured were in a serious condition. He said several workers were missing and could be trapped inside the building. "We're still searching the area to see if there are more dead," he added. Footage from the scene showed local people gathering outside, many of them in tears as they awaited news of friends or relatives. Paramedics were treating the injured, some of whom were badly burned. Ciudad Juarez is in the state of Chihuahua on the border with the US state of Texas. Factories such as the one affected, known as maquiladoras, are located in a free trade zone between the United States and Mexico. They are estimated to employ more than one million Mexicans. The BBC's Will Grant in Mexico City says maquiladoras are often criticised by labour rights groups for their low wages and poor working conditions, as they try to compete with China to manufacture cheap goods for the US market. </body>

      <title>Cuba to scrap two-currency system</title>

      <body>Cuba is to scrap its two-currency system in the latest financial reform rolled out by President Raul Castro, official media report. Since 1994 Cuba has had two currencies, one pegged to the US dollar and the other worth only a fraction of that. The more valuable convertible peso (CUC) was reserved for use in the tourism sector and foreign trade. Now its value will be gradually unified with the lower-value CUP, ending a system resented by ordinary Cubans. The Cuban economy is almost entirely state-run and the tourism sector has boomed since the collapse of the Soviet Union plunged Cuba into economic isolation and hardship. The two-currency system was supposed to protect Cuba's fragile economy but angered locals paid in the much lower-value CUP and denied access to goods only available for those with convertible pesos. The policy exacerbated the creation of a two-tier class system in Cuba which divided privileged Cubans with access to the lucrative tourist and foreign-trade sectors from those working in the local economy - all-too-visibly contradicting Cuba's supposedly egalitarian society. The council of ministers has approved a timetable for implementing "measures that will lead to monetary and exchange unification", the official Communist Party newspaper Granma said. Unification is "imperative to guarantee the re-establishment of the Cuban peso's value and its role as money, that is as a unit of accounting, means of payment and savings", it said. It gave no details of how quickly the change would be implemented, though Reuters news agency quoted Cuban economists as saying it would take about 18 months. </body>

      <title>Al-Shabab commander 'had time in UK'</title>
      <description>A senior Islamist militant who was the target of a recent abortive US special forces raid in Somalia had spent time in the UK, his friends tell the BBC.</description>

      <body>An al-Shabab commander who was the target of a recent abortive US special forces raid in Somalia had spent time in the UK, the BBC has learned. Abdukadir Mohamed Abdukadir, widely known as Ikrima, has been linked to alleged terror plots in Kenya. Friends have told the BBC that he came to the UK in 2007 and spent time in London, before moving to Somalia the following year. US Navy Seals failed in an attempt to capture him on 5 October. The raid followed an attack on the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi, Kenya, on 21 September that lasted four days and left at least 67 people dead. Al-Shabab has claimed responsibility for the siege. The BBC's East Africa correspondent Gabriel Gatehouse said it was not clear what role, if any, Ikrima had played in that attack. He is thought to be a recruiter of foreign fighters, and a key link between al-Shabab in Somalia, and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based in Yemen, our correspondent added. In 2004 he travelled to Norway, where he unsuccessfully sought asylum. The BBC has discovered that in early 2007 he came to Britain and spent time in London, before moving back to Somalia. Leaked Kenyan intelligence documents have linked him to Samantha Lewthwaite - the British widow of one of the 7/7 suicide attackers on the London transport system in 2005. An alleged plot to bomb targets in Kenya was foiled, police say, when they raided a number of addresses in Mombasa in December 2011. Ms Lewthwaite slipped away, her whereabouts are unknown. Our correspondent said the Kenyan authorities believe apprehending Ms Lewthwaite and Ikrima could help prevent future attacks similar to the one at Westgate. Meanwhile, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon has said an extra 4,500 troops are needed by the UN-backed African Union force (Amisom) fighting al-Shabab in Somalia. Mr Ban said in a report to the UN Security Council that recent military advances against al-Shabab could be reversed and there was a danger of more Westgate-style attacks if the 18,000-strong force was not bolstered. Al-Shabab said it had staged the attack on Westgate in response to Kenya's army joining Amisom and carrying out operations on Somali territory. The UN chief said that in addition to a troop surge, which would have to be paid for by richer UN member states, the African force also needed military attack helicopters. He appealed to both African and non-African countries to supply these. The BBC's international development correspondent Mark Doyle said the African Union had requested a boost of more than 6,000 troops, so concern had been expressed by African diplomats at the lower figure recommended by Mr Ban. In the past two years, Amisom has made significant advances against al-Shabab, pushing their main armed units out of several cities including the capital, Mogadishu, and the key southern port of Kismayo. But the militants still control many smaller towns and large rural areas of southern Somalia. </body>

      <body>Italian authorities have intercepted some 800 migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean as EU leaders meet in Brussels to discuss the problem. Dozens of women and children were among more than 200 migrants on one boat found in difficulty 25 miles (40km) south of the island of Lampedusa. Two other boats were picked up further south of Lampedusa, one with nearly 100 Eritreans reportedly on board. Hundreds of migrants trying to reach Europe have drowned in recent weeks. Southern EU states including Italy and Malta have relaunched appeals for more support and resources, prompting the European Commission to call on EU countries to offer "additional and urgent contributions". The Commission is pressing for: However, national governments point out there are significant obstacles to some of these ambitions - including the lack of a stable government in Libya. National leaders are also conscious of strong resistance among many voters to further immigration. EU sources say the leaders are likely to promise improved co-operation, but not more money or resources. They say they first want to see a new surveillance effort, Eurosur, come into force, to see what effect that has. Maria Nicolini, the mayor of Lampedusa, the Italian island where many of the bodies have been brought ashore, was in Brussels on Thursday to lobby EU leaders. Many of the migrants who try to cross the Mediterranean come from developing countries afflicted by poverty and conflict, such as Syria and Eritrea. The UN special rapporteur on human rights in Eritrea said on Thursday that thousands Eritreans were fleeing their country every month, despite a "shoot-to-kill policy" targeting those attempting to leave. The envoy, Sheila Keetharuth, said Eritreans were subject to "the most serious human rights violations", including extra-judicial killings, torture and inhumane prison conditions. She said that according to UN figures, 7,504 Eritreans and 7,557 Syrians had arrived in Italy in the first nine months of the year. Boats, often operated by trafficking gangs, have been attempting the crossing to Europe for many years. But the issue was brought the fore earlier this month when more than 350 people - mostly Somalis and Eritreans - died after their boat sank off Lampedusa. </body>

They were ejected from parliament by the Supreme Court but the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) accused judges of collaborating with the government. An aide to the president has dismissed the allegation as "absolutely wrong". The dismissed MPs say they will not accept the court ruling and will continue to serve as MPs regardless. The situation in the Maldives is tense after the first round of a presidential election held in September was annulled by the Supreme Court. The court ruled that electoral lists included made-up names and those of dead people. International observers had all praised the conduct of the first-round election - in which former President Mohamed Nasheed, of the MDP, got 45% of the vote. A second attempt at a vote was blocked by police last Saturday in a move declared illegal by the country's Human Rights Commission. The new election will now be held on 9 November, and a run-off - if required - on 16 November. In a 4-3 majority, the Supreme Court disqualified the two MPs - Ali Azim and Mohamed Nashiz - from parliament for the non-payment of a debt of $9m (£5.5m) for which they had signed as loan guarantors. The Maldives chief justice, who was also on the bench, disagreed with the majority view that the MPs' alleged offence made them liable for disqualification. Ahmed Naseem, who served as foreign minister under Mr Nasheed, told the BBC the case was an old one and had been resuscitated to reduce the MDP's thin majority in parliament. He described the ruling as "totally biased and unconstitutional". The party says corruption charges against government-aligned MPs have, in contrast, been dropped. There are also police notices against three other MDP parliamentarians for alleged contempt of court. A further one is the subject of an arrest warrant from the criminal court in a case of alleged alcohol and drug use. He has taken refuge in parliament. Masood Imad, President Mohamed Waheed's aide, said it was "sad" that the MDP was blaming the government over the MPs' fate. "The government has nothing to do with this - it's a judicial matter," he said. "We don't have any control over the judiciary and don't interfere with judicial matters." In another development, the office of Mr Nasheed said there had been threats to his life from "al-Qaeda agents". A spokesman for the office said it did not know who might be responsible but added: "I'm assuming the threat is real because there have been many such attempts in the past." The spokesman has asked state security bodies to check the information and ensure Mr Nasheed's security. On the death threat allegation, Mr Imad said that if Mr Nasheed gave a clear indication of who the alleged al-Qaeda figures were, "we'll arrest them and throw them out of the country". </body>

      <body>South Korean forces have carried out a drill aimed at repelling foreign landings on disputed islands at the heart of a row with Japan. The drill took place at an outcrop known in South Korea as Dokdo and in Japan as Takeshima. The long-running row over the islands has affected ties between the two nations. Both Japan and South Korea say they have long-standing historical ties to, and claims over, the island grouping. The drill, which included destroyers and combat jets, took place on what South Korea has designated "Dokdo Day". "It is a regular drill aimed at repealing non-military forces that approach Dokdo via a sea or air route," an unidentified military official told Yonhap news agency. A defence ministry official said that it was important to show the area "would be defended by South Korea, in whatever circumstances". Tensions over the disputed islands between South Korea and Japan have worsened recently, reports the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul, with both sides taking their conflict online and posting videos supporting their claims on the YouTube website. The islets have become a lightening rod for unresolved historical issues between the two neighbours - a symbol, say many Koreans, of Japan's lack of remorse for its colonial past, our correspondent adds. The territories themselves consist of two main islands and about 30 smaller rocks. A South Korean coastguard detachment has been stationed there since 1954. There was no immediate response from Japan to the drill, which is not the first to be held in the area. </body>

      <body>David Cameron has won the backing of EU chief Jose Manuel Barroso for his push to limit the number of new regulations coming out of Brussels. The two chaired a meeting of EU leaders on the issue at Friday's summit. The prime minister has said firms are being "throttled" by red tape and for every regulation and directive introduced another should be removed. Mr Barroso said more needed to be done to ensure "lighter, simpler, cheaper, common-sense regulation". The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, has said it has already cut 5,590 regulations since 2005. Mr Cameron is committed to renegotiating the UK's relationship with the EU if the Conservative Party wins the next election, ahead of an "in-out" referendum on whether the country should remain a member. In the meantime, he is promising to work to reduce the bureaucracy facing companies. Conservative sources say he wants to see 1,500 regulations reviewed. Eighty business leaders, including the chairmen of BT and Asda, have signed a letter calling for a "strong commitment" by the government towards this and several have accompanied Mr Cameron to Brussels to make the case. The prime minister has made the issue the central objective of the two-day European Council meeting. He held one-to-one meetings with the leaders of Germany and the Netherlands, who share similar views on deregulation, and co-chaired a meeting with the leaders of Poland, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy and Estonia, who are also sympathetic. "The Commission has done an excellent job in lifting the burden of bureaucracy. Now I want to get business engaged," he said, adding that a faster pace of deregulation was essential to getting firms to "compete and succeed". Mr Barroso, the Commission's president, said he appreciated that businesses needed a single set of rules, rather than 28 different bodies of national regulation, for the single market to work and for the important digital economy to continue to grow. Acknowledging that "useless laws weaken necessary laws", he said there were other areas where it was necessary to cut bureaucracy without reducing standards of consumer protection, health and safety and environmental concerns. "That is why we have to slash red tape," he said. </body>

      <title>Russia 2018 boycott possible - Toure</title>
      <description>Black players may boycott Russia's World Cup in 2018 unless the country tackles racism in football, Yaya Toure suggests.</description>

      <body>Black players might boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia unless the country tackles racism in football, according to Manchester City's Yaya Toure. "If we aren't confident at the World Cup, coming to Russia, we don't come," the Ivorian midfielder said. Uefa is investigating Toure's complaint that he was racially abused by some CSKA fans during Wednesday's Champions League game in Moscow. The Russian club denies any racist chanting took place. CSKA, which said it was "surprised and disappointed" by Toure's allegation, will face a disciplinary hearing on 30 October. If found guilty, Uefa could force CSKA to close part of its stadium for a future game. A club statement read: "Having carefully studied the video of the game, we found no racist insults from fans of CSKA." Spokesman Michael Sanadze told BBC Radio 5 live: "We have nothing to hide, of course, and we have confirmation from the match delegate and the venue director that they themselves didn't hear anything special." But Piara Powar, executive director of European anti-discrimination body Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare) and a member of Fifa's anti-discrimination taskforce, backed Toure's stance. He said: "Yaya Toure is absolutely right in raising the spectre of African players or players of African heritage not going to the 2018 World Cup - and without them there will not be a World Cup in Russia. "I wouldn't blame them. In this era, players are the most powerful force and if all the players said they are not going there wouldn't be a World Cup, or if there was it would be meaningless." Former West Ham striker and Torquay boss Leroy Rosenior, who also works with Show Racism the Red Card, thinks players threatening to boycott Fifa's biggest tournament might prompt the organisation into taking more robust action. "I think that it's got to a point now where, when we saw the reaction of CSKA who didn't even recognise that there was a problem, people are starting to think that this isn't something that is stagnating. We're actually going backwards," he told BBC Radio 5 live. "Boycotting the World Cup, which is sanctioned by Fifa, is a threat that maybe needs to be a serious threat because you want the authorities to come up with something off the back of a threat which will actually get something positive happening." </body>

      <body>At least four people have been killed in Tripoli, Lebanon, in fighting between supporters and opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Gunmen have been trading fire between the Sunni district of Bab al-Tabbana and the Alawite district of Jabal Muhsin since Monday. Dozens of people have been injured in the violence, officials say. The adjacent neighbourhoods have witnessed sporadic clashes since the Syrian conflict began in early 2011. President Assad is a member of the Alawite sect and is fighting a Sunni-led revolt. Tripoli, with a small Alawite community living in the midst of a Sunni majority, is seen as one of Lebanon's most volatile sectarian faultlines. A security official said the Lebanese army was "responding to all sources of fire", AFP news agency reported. "Snipers are hiding on the rooftops and in the streets," it quoted the unnamed official as saying. On-off fighting between the two districts have claimed scores of lives over the past two years. </body>

      <body>A spokesman for the Saudi interior ministry has warned women that measures may be taken against them if they take part in a campaign against a ban on female drivers. A new campaign to give women the right to drive will culminate in Saudi Arabia this Saturday. Women are being encouraged to take to the wheel in defiance of the ban. It is the third protest of its kind; in the first in 1990, a number of women were arrested or lost their jobs. The interior ministry spokesman, Mansour al-Turki, has considerably toughened the Saudi government line on the women drivers' campaign. A previous statement on Wednesday was confusing, with both those pro- and anti- the campaign believing it favoured them. But now Mr Turki has explicitly restated that women are prohibited from driving, with violators - and their supporters - likely to face unspecified measures. A campaign activist, Zaki Safar, said that this was an unusually explicit statement of the ban, which is informal rather than enshrined in Saudi law. "It is no longer an issue of a social choice - that the government does not itself support the ban," Mr Safar told the BBC. "No, the spokesman was very clear. And any woman who drives on the 26th will face punishment." But Mr Safar believes the government is still sending mixed messages, as it is itself divided over whether to lift the ban. Earlier this week, about 100 conservative clerics asked for an audience at the royal court in the capital, Riyadh, to denounce the campaign as a conspiracy by women and a threat to the country. But there have been indications of a less hardline attitude by the authorities than back in 1990, and at the second protest in 2011. As part of the latest campaign, dozens of women have posted online videos of themselves driving in different Saudi cities. None of them has been arrested. The activists behind the campaign believe the public mood is changing, with many more people - including an increasing number of men - publicly supporting the lifting of the ban. Some 17,000 people have so far signed a petition calling either for change or a clear explanation of why it should remain in force.

      <body>The Grangemouth petrochemical plant near Falkirk is to stay open after a new deal was struck with workers. Staff were told in a mass meeting at 11:00 that the decision to close the site would be reversed. Operator Ineos announced on Wednesday that the plant was to shut, with the loss of 800 jobs, after union members rejected a survival plan. But on Friday, Ineos said it would reopen the plant and the neighbouring oil refinery "with immediate effect". The news was welcomed by the Unite union and political leaders. The company said the move had followed a "dramatic U-turn" by Unite and its "belated recognition" that the company's survival plan was the only way to ensure Grangemouth's long-term future. It added that Unite had agreed to taking no strike action for three years, moving to a "modern" pension scheme and accepting a three-year pay freeze. Ineos also confirmed it would invest a further £300m in the site's long-term future. The company's announcement was greeted by huge cheers from the workforce, who had gathered at the plant to be told of the company's decision. Unite Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said: "Relief will ring right round the Grangemouth community, and across Scotland today. "Hundreds of jobs that would have been lost can now be saved and £300m will be invested into the plant." First Minister Alex Salmond described the announcement as a "tremendous fillip for the workforce and the whole Grangemouth community, following what could have been a potential disaster". He said it had been "a great team effort from all concerned", including the unions and workforce, the management and governments. "I am delighted that people have rallied round to protect these jobs, and now we can all agree that Grangemouth has an outstanding future," he added. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael also welcomed the announcement, saying that it was "the news that we all wanted". "The staff and their families have been through a very stressful and uncertain time," he said. "They have been through a hell of a week and I hope they have a much better weekend as a result of today's announcement." Mr Carmichael added: "They can look to the future with an optimism which was absent earlier in the week." Ineos' future plans include investing a further £300m in the site. Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean said: "It is a huge investment and that investment was only rightly to be done if we had a long-term sustainable base. "What we have now done is given the chemicals business another 15 to 20 years on the back of new raw materials, new contracts and significant investment." Mr MacLean would not dismiss the prospect of redundancies, but said they would be "very limited". He also denied that the company had demanded any additional concessions from the union. The company said the Scottish government had indicated it would support its application for a £9m grant to help finance a gas terminal, while the UK government had given "pre-qualification approval" for a £125m loan guarantee facility. Ineos founder and chairman Jim Ratcliffe said it was "a victory for common sense". He told the BBC that the Grangemouth complex "should have a life for many years to come, as long as we can get this gas terminal built and we can sign up gas contracts and bring gas in from America". The company has indicated that 2,000 contractors it laid off after shutting down the complex would be re-hired to support investment in its survival plan. Falkirk Council, which had planned to set up a task force to respond to the threatened closure, said the Ineos announcement was "the best possible outcome for all concerned". Council leader Craig Martin added: "There has been a tremendous effort behind the scenes to secure the plant's future involving UK and Scottish governments and Falkirk Council, working together to ensure the plant's survival. "This partnership approach has paid off and a more stable and positive future for the workforce has been delivered." The closure move came after workers rejected a deal which would have changed their pay and pensions. Ministers and Unite were involved in top-level talks on Thursday to try to save the site and a fresh offer was made by unions to the company. </body>

      <title>Firefighters to stage more strikes</title>
      <description>Firefighters in England and Wales are to strike on 1 and 4 November in a row over pensions, the Fire Brigades Union says.</description>

      <body>Firefighters in England and Wales are to stage two more strikes in the run-up to bonfire night in a row over pensions, the Fire Brigades Union says. The government wants firefighters to work up to 60 but the union says this is too old to be fighting fires. FBU members are due to walk out on 1 November from 18:30 to 23:00 GMT and on 4 November from 06:00 to 08:00 GMT. In the first round of action last month, 32,000 union members in England and Wales walked out, the FBU said. A second strike was called off earlier this month after progress was made during talks. The FBU postponed the five-hour strike saying that the government and fire employers had shifted their position and recognised that firefighters faced losing their jobs and a "large chunk" of their pensions under new changes imposed in April. However, the FBU now says the government and fire employers have failed to offer any firm guarantees on jobs or pensions. FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said: "The Westminster government has created this mess, but it is refusing to clear it up. "It now recognises the problem but it won't provide the legal and financial guarantees firefighters need to ensure they have a job and an unreduced pension in the future. "Firefighters face the sack towards the end of their career and the loss of their pension. That can't be right. "The employers promised to tackle the issue of firefighters facing the sack for failing fitness tests last week, only to say they can't offer any guarantees this week. "That is simply not the way to run a public service. "The government is now making threats to withdraw some of the other concessions they have made this year." London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson said it was prepared to deal with further strikes and would have 27 fire engines based at strategic points across the capital. "The evening strike date falls on the Friday before bonfire night. It is just before Diwali and coincides with half-term, so people need to be really careful with fireworks and bonfires," he said. During the first strike on 25 September, contingency plans at the 46 fire services in England and three in Wales included using part-time and volunteer firefighters, calling in non-union fire crews and bringing in private contractors. The armed forces had a back-up role and in the event of a major incident, union members could have returned to work. No major incidents were reported during the four-hour strike which was the first national walkout for a decade. </body>

      <title>Twitter float could raise $1.4bn</title>

      <body>Twitter has unveiled the price range for its shares when the company lists on the stock exchange. In a filing on Thursday, Twitter said it planned to sell 70 million shares priced between $17 and $20 (£10 - £12) to raise up to $1.4bn (£865m). The offering represents 13% of Twitter and values it at as much as $11bn. Analysts said the valuation, which was less than forecast, indicated the firm wanted to avoid the dip in prices that followed Facebook's listing. "They're trying to price this for a very strong IPO, ideally creating the conditions for a solid after-market," said Brian Wieser of the Pivotal Research Group. Facebook's shares were priced initially at $38 per share. The stock soared within hours of its debut to a high of $45 but later slumped. Some analysts had blamed over pricing of the shares as a reason behind the fall. However, Facebook shares have since recouped most of their losses and are now trading above the listing price. Twitter's share sale on the New York Stock Exchange will make it the biggest internet company to go public after Facebook. The microblogging site has seen steady growth since its launch seven years ago. According to its IPO documents, it now has 218 million monthly users and 500 million tweets are sent a day. However, all those users and tweets have not yet resulted in a profit. Twitter made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m. Some analysts said that while the lower-than-expected pricing may help its share prices in the days after the listing, in the long run investors would still need to see the firm make profits. "The fact that the valuation is lower than expectations, I think was smart by the underwriters. I think it will help the pop," said Michael Yoshikami of Destinational Wealth Management. "But in the end, even for $11bn, the question is can they come up with earnings to substantiate that number? And it's unclear that they're going to be able to do that." Almost 85% of Twitter's revenue currently comes from advertising on its site. There are three main ways for a company or an individual to advertise on Twitter: by promoting a tweet that will appear in people's timelines, promoting a whole account, or promoting a trend. Twitter tends to charge its advertisers according to the amount of interaction their content generates. Some analysts say the company has showing strong signs of growth, with revenue rising from just $28m in 2010 to $317m by the end of 2012. One research firm, eMarketer, has even estimated that Twitter's revenues from advertising sales will increase by more than 100% by the end of this year. </body>

      <body>Samsung Electronics has reported a 26% jump in profit in the third quarter driven by strong smartphone sales and a recovery in its memory chip business. It made a net profit of 8.24 trillion won ($7.6bn; £4.7bn) in the July-to-September quarter, up from 6.56tn won during the same period a year earlier. Operating profit rose to a record 10.2 trillion won during the quarter. The firm said sales of smartphones, a key driver of its growth, are expected to rise further in coming months. It said that sales "will gain momentum due to year-end promotions over the holiday season and an improved line-up of mass-market smartphones". Samsung has posted record operating profit in six of the past seven quarters, mostly due to the growth of its smartphone division. The firm has enjoyed success in both the top-end as well as lower end of the smartphone market, giving it an edge over rivals such as Apple which makes only top-end phones. Its growth in the sector has seen it become the world's biggest smartphone maker. However, there have been concerns over whether Samsung can continue to grow at such a strong pace, not least because of increased competition and saturation of some key markets. "Samsung has done well, having rapidly caught up with Apple in the smartphone market. But I'm concerned whether Samsung would be able to do better," said Kim Sung-soo, a fund manager at LS Asset Management. "Like Nokia, Samsung may hit a limit in increasing market share. Apple is also fighting back, signalling an uphill battle for Samsung." Analysts said that the company needed to come up with more innovative products to help sustain its growth rate. For its part, Samsung has been taking steps in that direction. Earlier this month, it launched a smartphone with a curved display screen, beating its rival LG by at least a few months to offer a handset featuring flexible-screen tech. In September, it unveiled a smartwatch with a colour screen that can show alerts, be used for voice calls and run apps. Again, it edged firms such as Microsoft, Apple and Google to unveil such a device. Samsung's latest earnings were also boosted by its semiconductor business, which saw profit more than double to 2.1tn won, the highest in three years. Revenues in the division rose 12% over the previous quarter to 9.74tn won. The firm saw its bottom line buoyed by stronger chip prices after a fire at a plant owned by rival SK Hynix caused tightened supply in the market. Samsung supplies chips to other smartphone-makers, including its biggest competitor Apple, and expects demand to pick up as the year draws to a close. However, its consumer electronics division, which includes TV manufacturing, saw a decline in profit due to a drop in demand in China and Europe. But Samsung said that it expects the unit to bounce back in the current quarter, not least due to holiday season shopping during the end of the year. </body>

      <body>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show. The Office for National Statistics said there had been a "fairly strong" performance across all sectors. The data builds on a 0.7% GDP rise in the April-June period and is the best quarterly performance since 2010. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne tweeted: "This shows that Britain's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity." Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the figures "show that we are firmly on the road to economic recovery". The ONS data for construction was up 2.5% over the quarter, the second successive quarter of growth after a volatile performance over the past year. The BBC's chief economics correspondent, Hugh Pym, said: "This could signal that a recovery in that sector is really under way." House-builders have been buoyed by the Government's Help to Buy scheme, which recently launched a new phase offering mortgage guarantees. The ONS said that production grew by 0.5%, though this remains 12.8% off its 2008 level, while within this, manufacturing improved 0.9% in the third quarter. The services sector, which represents three-quarters of economic output, grew by 0.7%. Output from services is now above its pre-crisis peak in the first quarter of 2008. Friday's figure is the first estimate, and could be revised up or down in subsequent months. Mr Osborne told the BBC: "It shows that we are on the path to prosperity. Lots of risks remain, so we have to stick with the economic plan that has got us this far. "What's encouraging about these figures is that it's not just services that are growing. Construction is growing and manufacturing is growing." Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: "After three damaging years of flatlining, it's both welcome and long overdue that our economy is growing again. "But for millions of people across the country still seeing prices rising faster than their wages, this is no recovery at all." Despite the further evidence that recovery is gaining hold, some economists remain cautious. The Institute of Directors' chief economist Graeme Leach said: "The outlook looks better than at any time since the onset of the financial crisis. Indeed, our members have more confidence in the economy than at any time since 2008. "However, strong headwinds remain and the annual growth rate year on year is nothing to get too excited about yet. Though inflationary pressures are likely to remain benign, debt and inflation are rising faster than earnings. "By far the biggest challenges remain on the supply side, not the demand side. Supply side constraints mean that the current growth spurt is unlikely to extend beyond next year. "This stage of our economic recovery is likely to be short and sweet, instead of long and strong." The director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, John Longworth, said: "This is the highest quarterly increase we've seen in three years, so the economy is clearly moving in the right direction. "But we are still behind a number of advanced economies, such as the US and Germany, that have managed to recover the output lost during the economic downturn. "Much more needs to be done to transform our economy from being good to being really great." Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said the figures confirmed the UK was enjoying "a period of healthy and well-balanced growth". He said it was likely that the UK recorded the fastest quarterly growth rate within the G7 countries in the third quarter. But he added that a squeeze on real incomes as wage growth lagged behind inflation, together with the fiscal squeeze and a stagnant eurozone, were likely to prevent recovery gathering much more pace. It echoed remarks by Bank of England governor Mark Carney on Thursday evening, when he said in a speech that the rate of growth was "towards the top end of the advanced economies", but "coming from a very very low base". </body>

      <title>Boycott threat too early - Wenger</title>
      <description>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger says talk of boycotting the 2018 World Cup in protest at racism in Russia is premature.</description>

      <body>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says talk of boycotting the 2018 World Cup in Russia in protest at racism among the country's fans is premature. Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure has suggested black players could take action, after claiming he was abused during Wednesday's game at CSKA Moscow. "You have to fight racism, in Russia or wherever in the world," said Wenger. "To go as extreme as suggested (a boycott), it's a bit early to do that because it's not proven what happened." The Frenchman added: "You cannot tolerate racism. But I believe Russia itself has to fight against it." Uefa is investigating Toure's complaint that he was subjected to racist abuse by some CSKA supporters during the 2-1 Champions League win in Moscow. The Russian club denies any racist chanting took place. And on Friday, the governing body's president, Michel Platini, ordered an internal investigation  into why proper protocol was not followed in the handling of the incident. Platini's statement comes a day after Kick It Out  chairman Lord Ouseley said that the match referee Ovidiu Hategan should not officiate again for failing to deal with the alleged abuse. Meanwhile, former Manchester City chief executive Garry Cook has said Toure's comments might have been made in the "heat of the moment". "Yaya Toure is the talent, engaging in the game, and he's creating a lot of fans and a lot of enjoyment," he said. "I think we tend to make rash decisions in the heat of the moment. "The game itself needs to collaborate and support and make sure we have a clear strategy and policy against racism. "There is a lot more consideration to be given to the issue, but the governing body need to have a very strong stand and make their point well." </body>

      <body>Sebastian Vettel would not be "afraid" of taking on one of Formula 1's other leading names as his team-mate but insists he has nothing to prove. The German can clinch a fourth world title in India on Sunday but has to face claims his remarkable success is largely down to having the best car. Red Bull resisted opportunities in the last 18 months to sign Lewis Hamilton, Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso. "One day maybe I will race alongside Kimi or Fernando," Vettel said. "It depends how long we stick around. But I am not afraid of that because you want to beat the guys on the track and you want to find out who is the best." Vettel, who has won the last five races in a row, needs only a fifth place in the Indian Grand Prix to be absolutely sure of the title. Only Ferrari's Fernando Alonso is mathematically able to beat him, but is 90 points behind with only 100 still available. The Spaniard needs to out-score Vettel by 16 points on Sunday to prolong the championship to the next race in Abu Dhabi next weekend. Vettel, who was talking in an exclusive BBC Sport interview to be broadcast ahead of the race on Sunday, rejected a suggestion that he needs to take on Alonso, Hamilton or Raikkonen in another car to prove his greatness to any doubters. "You can think about this a lot," he said. "I think we don't have to prove anything. I think we have proven enough. "We have had three fantastic years. This year has been fantastic. I believe things happen for a reason. "For sure you need the right package. We had a very strong package the last couple of years. I believe we had a very strong package in 2009, when we finished second in the championship. "With the experience I have today maybe 2009 would have been different. At the time I did the best I could. I did mistakes, I still do now, but the most important thing is I learn from them. "You can find lots of difficulties I had to face. [Last year] we got sent to the back of the grid in Abu Dhabi and had to come back, we had a nightmare race in Brazil. "We managed to come back [and seal the championship]. It was a bit tight in some places, a bit lucky. We worked very hard for what we have achieved basically, as a team. "For sure some people will think you have to do this and that. The most important is to prove something to yourself." Asked how he felt he compared as a driver to Hamilton and Alonso, Vettel said: "It's difficult because I don't know what they do. I can see what they do on the track. I don't know how much time they spend setting up the car, how much they care. "I'm sure we all care because no-one wants to drive a car that is set up badly, but for sure some people invest more time and some less. I don't think there is a right and wrong, it is what you feel happy with."

      <body>Sebastian Vettel headed team-mate Mark Webber as Red Bull took a dominant one-two in Friday practice at the Indian Grand Prix. Vettel, on the verge of a fourth title after winning the last five races, was nearly 0.5 seconds quicker than Lotus driver Romain Grosjean in third. Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg were fourth and sixth, sandwiching Ferrari's Fernando Alonso. Ferrari's Felipe Massa was seventh ahead of Kimi Raikkonen's Lotus. McLaren's Sergio Perez and Jenson Button rounded out the top 10. Vettel appears to be in control at the Buddh International Circuit, setting the fastest time in the low-fuel, qualifying trim and also on the medium tyres, which will be the preferred choice in the race, when running a heavier fuel load later in the session. On pure pace, the German ended the session 0.289secs clear of Webber, 0.498secs ahead of Grosjean and 0.677secs clear of Hamilton, who was 0.031secs ahead of Alonso. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said: "We worked through a programme and had a good look at the tyres, which seemed to be fairly contrasting. "You couldn't have two more diametrically opposed tyres - one that lasts forever, the other that lasts not very long at all - but it was a positive day." He added that Lotus and Ferrari "have looked pretty strong" and thought Mercedes would be competitive, too. Red Bull driver Mark Webber said: "We're going OK on both short and longish runs. We have to look through everything tonight. We have some work to do." However, the Red Bull appeared to wear the 'soft' tyres very rapidly on race fuel levels. These will be the tyres the leading drivers have to start the race on after setting their qualifying times on them. Vettel managed only three laps of his race-simulation run on that tyre before they were effectively destroyed, whereas Alonso managed 10. But Hamilton said he felt fighting for pole position would be impossible. And Rosberg added: We're fighting for third place on the podium because the Red Bulls are just too quick again. Pole is also out of the question because they are too fast - especially Vettel. It's a bit of a pity, but that's just the way it is." BBC F1 technical analyst Gary Anderson does not think Vettel, who was won both Indian races run so far, is guaranteed victory on Sunday. "I don't think it's all over," he said. "I think it will be harder for Vettel than the last two years. Mercedes and Lotus look quite close." Lotus reserve driver Davide Valsecchi, acting as BBC 5 live analyst, said: "It was an interesting day. It seems like Red Bull will be really difficult to beat. "The only team that seems to drop in performance is Sauber. They were sixth and seventh on the grid in Suzuka [two weeks ago] but here they are outside the top 10." Sauber's fastest driver was Nico Hulkenberg in 14th place, behind Toro Rosso's Daniel Ricciardo in 11th, Force India's Adrian Sutil in 12th and the Williams of Valtteri Bottas in 13th.

      <title>Roth to play Blatter in Fifa film</title>

      <body>British actor Tim Roth is to star as Fifa president Sepp Blatter in a film about football's governing body. Provisionally titled F2014, Gerard Depardieu will also appear in the movie as Jules Rimet - one of Fifa's founders and its longest-serving president. In a video published on Fifa's website, Blatter said Roth's casting was "well done" and they had "common qualities". The film is due for release next year, to coincide with Fifa's 110th anniversary and the World Cup. Production will take place in France, Brazil and Azerbaijan. The video showed Blatter meeting with Roth for the first time in Zurich, which Blatter said was "a very interesting get-together". "I had read a lot of the CV and all the [films] that Tim Roth has made [and] I was very eager to meet him," the 77-year-old said. The movie is being made by French production companies Leuviah and Thelma Films. Blatter has run Fifa since 1998 amid a series of controversies including allegations of corruption. In 2004 the Swiss was criticised for suggesting female footballers should wear tighter shorts and low cut shirts to attract more male fans, while in 2011 he insisted there was no racism in football and any incidents could be settled with a handshake. He was also at the centre of allegations of bribery resulting in Qatar's successful 2022 World Cup bid and was criticised for saying gay football fans should not have sex while in the nation, where homosexuality is illegal. He has since apologised for his remarks. Roth, 52, will soon be seen on the big screen as Prince Rainier of Monaco, opposite Nicole Kidman in Grace of Monaco. </body>

      <body>Actors David Tennant and Olivia Coleman have helped ITV's Broadchurch win four prizes - dubbed the Daggers - at the Specsavers Crime Thriller Awards. The pair picked up the best actor and actress awards for their roles in the drama, with co-star Andrew Buchan named best supporting actor. Broadchurch also won the TV prize, with Bond movie Skyfall named best film. Martina Cole and Wilbur Smith were also inducted into the Crime Writers' Association Hall of Fame at the event. The pair were honoured in recognition of their contributions to the genre. The awards - which marked the culmination of ITV3's Crime Thriller Book Club - included a new award for the club's best read, which went to Malcolm MacKay for The Necessary Death Of Lewis Winter. After beating books by Linwood Barclay, Megan Abbott, Christopher Fowler, Diana Bretherick and Andrew Taylor, the author said it was "a huge honour and thrill to win". Mick Herron picked up the coveted Gold Dagger award for best crime novel of the year for Dead Lions. "My shelves are crammed with Gold Dagger-winning novels of the past - The Mermaids Singing, Black and Blue, Bones and Silence. I can't quite believe I get to put my own book next to them," he said. The best new crime writer prize went to Derek B Miller for his debut novel Norwegian By Night Roger, while Roger Hobbs's Ghostman was named best thriller of the year. Other awards went to Amelia Bullmore, who won best supporting actress for her role in ITV's Scott and Bailey, while Danish series The Killing III won the best international TV prize. The ceremony will be shown on ITV3 on 27 October at 21:00GMT. </body>

      <body>An Edinburgh author has been named the winner of the Edinburgh International Book Festival's 2013 First Book Award. Angela Jackson, one of 42 writers in contention, said it felt "particularly special" to win the prize for her debut novel, The Emergence of Judy Taylor. Visitors to this year's festival voted her book ahead of other first works by such authors as Gill Hornby, sister of Nick, and broadcaster Dawn O'Porter. Jackson's novel tells of a dissatisfied wife who embarks on a new life. "It's great to know I'm on the right track [and] that my work is connecting with readers," the author continued. The former musician and psychology lecturer said the prize would "spur [her] on to complete my second novel". Nick Barley, director of the Edinburgh International Book Festival, said Jackson's triumph was "a wonderful, home-grown success story". "Angela gave her first public reading at the Book Festival in 2010 and appeared again in 2011," he continued. "We were delighted to welcome her this year as a fully fledged and published author." Edinburgh's book festival, held every August in the city's Charlotte Square Gardens, celebrated its 30th anniversary this year. </body>

      <body>For five years in a row, Iceland has been rated the country with the world's smallest gender gap by the World Economic Forum (WEF). The rating means Iceland is the country where women enjoy the most equal access to education and healthcare. It is also where women are most likely to be able to participate fully in the country's political and economic life. Iceland is joined at the top of the The Global Gender Gap Report, 2013 by its Nordic neighbours Finland, Norway and Sweden. Overall, the gender gap narrowed slightly across the globe in 2013, as 86 of 133 countries showed improvements. However, "change is definitely slow", says one of the report's authors, Saadia Zahidi.

      <body>Long before the Metro, the steam trains of Petite Ceinture ("Little Belt" in English) connected Paris's main railway stations carrying people around the city along the path of its ancient walls. The circular line went into gradual decline from the 1930s, when competition arrived in the form of the more modern underground Metro system. For 32km (almost 20 miles) the tracks of Petite Ceinture snake through bustling Paris, isolated and largely unseen from street level in deep trenches, long tunnels, and bridges. Nature has reclaimed the space and it has become a haven for wild flowers and animals. The line is officially off-limits to the public, but this hasn't stopped many people attempting to explore it. There is now a fierce debate in the French capital about what to do with the tracks and stations of the Petite Ceinture that still remain. A small section opened as a park in August 2013 and the mayoral elections offer competing plans for cycle routes and parks. Associations set up to preserve the space would prefer to see the line reopened for pedestrian services. BBC News joined Thomas Jorion - a photographer who has been documenting the line since 1996 - on a tour of what he calls the last great wasteland in Paris.

      <title>Chinese villagers protest against land deal in Yunnan</title>
      <description>Chinese villagers battle police to stop tourist development on their land</description>

      <body>For days, police have been stationed on the outskirts of the tiny farming village of Guangji, in southern China's Yunnan province. They have been there since Tuesday, following a violent battle between villagers and police. At the centre of the dispute is a plot of farmland the villagers in Guangji and the surrounding area have used to grow crops for centuries. However, the local government plans to construct a $3.6bn (£2.2bn) tourist attraction on the land - a glitzy recreation of an ancient Chinese city. For months, three villagers have been circulating around the region, advising Guangji's 2,200 residents of their legal rights to the land. When the police arrived on Tuesday to arrest two of the men - Wang Zhengrong, 69, and his son, Wang Chunyun - the vast majority of the villagers banded together to force the police to leave. Wang Chunyun told the BBC that "a dozen thugs" found him on Tuesday evening and quickly surrounded him. When he asked them, "Who are you?", the men told him they were the police. When Mr Wang asked the men to show him their identification, they attacked him. He says he is now using Chinese herbs to treat his broken ribs, since he fears he will be arrested if he leaves the sanctity of the village. Mr Wang's father was also attacked and sustained multiple injuries, which caused him to lose consciousness twice. The older Mr Wang is described as a "proud communist" who fought for China in the Vietnam war by his friend and fellow village leader, Pu Yongfang. Locals report the police used tear gas and another unknown explosive against them, leading four villagers to sustain severe injuries and 40 more to also be hurt. Photos from the locals that were purportedly taken after the incident show villagers with blackened legs and fractured skulls the villagers appear to have tried to stitch up themselves. Villagers have told the BBC they are using Chinese herbs to treat their wounds and broken bones. They do not dare to leave the village, even to visit a nearby medical clinic, for fear of being arrested. According to state media reports, 27 police officers were also injured, leaving one officer in critical condition. An official who answered the phone at the Jinning County government hotline said she would not be able to provide any information on the incident for two days. An official at the Jinning police department refused to answer any questions. According to the Yunnan Daily, the province's main Communist Party newspaper, the Gu Dian Historic and Cultural Tourism Project will become one of the province's 10 landmark tourism sites. An artist's rendering of the project shows a vast complex of traditional Chinese buildings, decorated with golden rooftops and elaborate red columns. The project is expected to take three years to build and another two years to go into full operation. Disputes over farm land - who owns it and who has the right to earn money from it - in China often result in clashes between angry villagers, who feel the land belongs to them, and government officials, who are eager to boost investment and tax revenues in their region. It is unlikely the government will back down easily from this battle. Yunnan's Communist Party secretary, Qin Guangrong, attended an elaborate ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark the start of the tourist site's construction last October. Mr Qin's attendance highlights the level of the party's political stake in the multi-billion dollar plan that is touted as a plan to create jobs in Yunnan. Villages around the region are attempting to band together to stop officials from seizing any more of the land they will need to complete the project. In May, protests in the neighbouring villages of San He and An Jiang also resulted in violence. For now, tensions are running high inside Guangji village. Mr Pu, one of the village leaders, says villagers remain on "high alert". Ten thousand acres of farmland have already disappeared, he explains. And the locals here will do anything they can to prevent more from slipping through their grasp. </body>

      <body>Sushil Kumar has been cycling to and from his gardening jobs in south Delhi for more than 20 years. He has been knocked off his bike several times on the two-hour daily ride, fortunately escaping with cuts and bruises. But a friend who also relies on his pedal-cycle was taken to hospital recently after a truck driver hit him on a turn. Every day at least three cyclists or pedestrians are killed in Delhi, accounting for more than half the city's road deaths, according to one respected analysis of accident statistics - a sign of what experts say is a growing crisis in the capital's overloaded transport network. If anything else was causing "so many deaths and injuries as we see on our roads it would be a state of emergency", argues Aunomita Roychowdury of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a Delhi think-tank. The figures are as bad in other big cities like Mumbai. But everywhere the car is in the driving seat when it comes to transport policy - even though cyclists and pedestrians together account for nearly three times as many daily journeys, according to the CSE. In Calcutta, the authorities are going a step further, specifically barring cyclists from many roads as an extreme way to combat traffic congestion. You can count on one hand the number of Delhi roads with dedicated cycle lanes, despite millions using their bikes every day to get around. Most simply have to take their chances in the chaotic melee of buses, cars and rickshaws, as well as frequent wandering cows. Pedestrians and cyclists are the lowest in the pecking order. "It's much more dangerous now. There are more cars and they drive faster," says Mr Kumar. "My family worry whenever I am late back." As an occasional cyclist in Delhi, I know how terrifying it can be negotiating the city's ruthless traffic. You spend almost as much time looking behind as in front, in fear of one of the city's notorious bus drivers clipping you from behind. This week the squeeze on cyclists has been getting some headlines, after an accident involving the CSE head, Sunita Narain. She was knocked down while cycling through Delhi in the early hours by a driver who fled the scene, and is still recovering in hospital. In Europe, where cycling is back on the mainstream policy agenda, it is the middle class in the saddle. But it is the poor who account for most cyclists in India and they have little voice, says Prof Dinesh Mohan, a transport specialist at the India Institute of Technology in Delhi. Unless something is done to re-balance transport planning in Delhi and other cities, their problems are only likely to worsen. Car ownership is growing by 7% a year in Delhi, with at least 1,400 new cars being registered every day. Despite the arrival of a city-wide metro system, congestion and pollution are still increasing. And car ownership is "still low in comparison with other countries of similar income", says Prof Mohan. The answer he says is much better road design, to include cyclists and pedestrians' needs, and more stringent enforcement of traffic laws. There is a particular problem with drink-driving, accounting for as much as 40% of road accidents by some estimates. "It's a familiar pattern the world over," says Prof Mohan, of the over-emphasis on cars as countries develop. "But just because others have gone this way doesn't mean we have to as well." </body>

      <title>Yoga history - savage and serene</title>
      <description>Exhibition reveals the warrior yogis of medieval India</description>

      <body>Early yogis struck lovely poses - and also fought fierce battles. An exhibit in Washington shows the complex dimensions of yogi life. Do you like your yoga hot or powerful? Maybe you practise in the nude or spend a fortune on the latest Lycra. Are you a follower of BKS Iyengar, or do you prefer Vinyasa or Ashtanga yoga? Whatever your taste, yoga is a $5bn (£3.1bn) industry in the US practised by millions of people seeking physical fitness, improved health, or spiritual enlightenment. Almost every gym offers a class and the experience can be enhanced by drinking specially blended teas or listening to suitably soothing music. The Indian government has become so concerned about the commercialisation of yoga in recent years that it started a campaign to patent hundreds of postures to stop them being appropriated by Western companies. But the world's first exhibition exploring the visual art of yoga has revealed aspects of the ancient tradition that many purists will find troubling: in the 2,500 years of its known existence, there has never been one single type of yoga. "Five years ago I did think I would find that single yoga tradition," says Debra Diamond, curator of the exhibition Yoga: The Art of Transformation at the Smithsonian's Sackler Gallery of Asian Art. "But yoga constantly transformed and developed over time. Although there are a couple of main goals, there's nothing that shows up in every single yoga path. "For some traditions it was heightened consciousness and an end to suffering, a way to get out of the cycle of birth, death and re-birth that is so painful. But for other yoga traditions some of the goals were things like supernatural powers and the ability to control other people." The exhibition showcases 130 objects from 25 museums and private collections around the world. Many have never been seen in public while others are known masterpieces. Together they mark the start of a new field of study - how yoga's visual culture can shed light on its profound mysteries and hidden meanings. A group of fearsome looking yoginis, more than 1,000 years old, greet visitors at the start of the exhibition. These are flying goddesses who attained divinity by practising tantric yoga. They sit in audacious poses, baring their sharpened teeth and voluptuous breasts, their loose hair marking them as wild women. Some are adorned with snakes while another has her fingers in her mouth, ready to pierce the night skies with a war whistle. "They're the tough chicks of the 11th Century," says Diamond. The theme of the warrior yogi continues through the exhibition, culminating in a dazzling and intricate 16th Century watercolour illustrating the Battle at Thaneshwar, at a holy site in northern India. The blood flows freely as bands of armed yogis decapitate their rivals and battle over bathing rights at a festival. "Compared to what happens later on, it's a relatively small skirmish," says Sir James Mallinson, a Sanskrit expert and one of the exhibition advisers. "By the 18th Century the yogi sects are so powerful and so big that we have reports of huge pitched battles at these festivals where thousands and thousands of these yogis get killed." The painting is the earliest known depiction of a fight between yogi sects, which were hired as mercenaries by the Mughal emperors until the British disbanded them. Sir James is a yogi himself and has spent many years living and studying yoga in India. He is the first Westerner in his sect of master yogis to be ordained as a Mahant, or commander, with the authority to raise his own troops. He sees no conflict between yoga's peaceful pursuit of spiritual enlightenment and its more violent manifestations. "For these guys, even to this day, they see no contradiction," he says. "They understand yoga and their other practices are generating a kind of internal power which they can then use in various different ways, giving blessings or curses or indeed fighting." Given yoga's bloody history, it may seem odd that in the US it is practised largely by women seeking to relieve stress. That trend has its roots in the 19th Century when women's exercise emphasised stretching rather than the more masculine activity of weight lifting. "For guys, exercise is sports and competition, which seems to fly in the face of what yoga is about - but doesn't actually. Men just don't know what yoga is," says John Schumacher, director of Unity Woods Yoga Center in Washington - and one of a handful of American yoga teachers to qualify under Iyengar. "The very qualities that make a top athlete are the qualities necessary for excellence in yoga - not just physical flexibility, strength and stamina, but the whole quality of meditation which involves focus and clarity." The exhibition explores how such perceptions of yoga have changed as the practice crossed cultures and continents. "This is a very complicated and tricky section because what we have are very often images of European desire, what Europeans believed about the exotic in India and what they believed about yogis," says Diamond. On display are a number of early photographs of yogis presented as "native views" with elaborate backgrounds and props that fuelled the imagination of Western viewers. "Yogis were seen as quite sinister and dubious figures," she says. "They claimed to have worldly or supernatural powers, they were scantily dressed or naked, which was very upsetting to 19th Century sensibilities. They wandered around and often smoked dope. They became reviled as the stereotype of everything that was decadent about India." But as this ground-breaking exhibition shows, yoga has retained its power to transform, not just the bodies and minds of its practitioners, but yoga itself. The yoginis of the 11th Century wouldn't recognise their sisters in the 21st. Or would they? </body>

      <title>The phone you can build like Lego</title>
      <description>The mobile you put together from separate modules</description>

      <body>A new mobile phone concept that would give users a chance to choose from a range of components, and replace or upgrade them when necessary, has generated enormous interest online. But could this sustainable, modular device ever become a reality? Six months ago, the Dutch designer Dave Hakkens took apart his favourite camera. "I noticed all these little parts," he says. "And everything was good except for the lens motor. That had broken." But when Hakkens contacted the manufacturer to get a replacement motor, he was advised to just replace the whole camera. "With your bike you repair the tyre, you don't throw the bike away," he says. "But for some reason this is what we do with electronics." Hakkens realised that if a device could be taken apart and upgraded more easily it would last much longer, minimising electrical waste. And so the idea of Phonebloks was born. The concept - Hakkens hasn't figured out how to actually make it - is for a phone with a replaceable screen and easily moveable, changeable "bloks", each containing a different element such as battery, chipset, gyroscope and so on. In the video Hakkens made to publicise Phonebloks, the bits fall into place on the backplate of the phone like pieces of Lego. The bloks vary in size and can be made to tessellate in any number of combinations. "Let's say this is your phone and you do everything in the cloud - why not replace your storage blok with a bigger battery blok?" asks the voiceover. "If you're like this guy and love to take pictures, why not upgrade your camera?" Last month, Hakkens set about showing off Phonebloks using the "crowd speaking" platform Thunderclap. Users donate their social reach to a project they support, allowing the site to commandeer their Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook accounts to broadcast a message at a single, predetermined moment. Hakkens was aiming for 500 people to sign up to his Thunderclap, but the Phonebloks video went viral, gaining seven million views in three days. He has now amassed 950,000 Thunderclap supporters and on Tuesday the Phonebloks video will ping across social networks 375 million times. "It comes down to a consumer signal," says Kyle Wiens, the founder of iFixit.com, a repository for user-generated repair manuals to the latest gadgets. "The market needs to indicate to manufacturers that we care about modular, repairable hardware." Phones have never been as modular as computers, but Wiens says they used to be sturdier and more repairable. Take batteries. Until the iPhone came along in 2007, batteries on all handsets could be readily removed. With every new phone the power source is a little bit harder to get to, stuck down with more glue, or tucked away in a case that's more impregnable. To get the battery out of the HTC One, the geeks at iFixit had to mangle the phone's casing and remove the motherboard. "I wish batteries were more replaceable than they are," says Bruce Harvey, an electrical engineer at Florida State University. "The reason they're not is in order to make the phone so small, the battery's shape is conformed to fit in there, rather than be a square block [like Phonebloks]." It is consumer preference for a small phone that has pushed manufacturers to hide their batteries away. In the same way, our craving for ever-slimmer, speedier phones has led them to pile hardware - such as the central processor, memory and wifi - on to the same chip, not separate them out into blocks. Harvey believes that Phonebloks is a technical challenge but an achievable one. The bloks could talk to one another if they were all designed to work with the same signalling system. However, he says the real difficulty would be in making a modular phone robust enough to survive the "harsh environment" of the trouser pocket. Each component would have to be encased in a material such as plastic, adding thickness and making the device less sexy. "It's one of those things where if people look at it they say, 'Wow, I can be more ecologically sound, I get upgrades when I want to…'" he says. "Then someone shows them that their phone's going to be six-tenths of an inch (1.5cm) thick or something like that. Reality will meet up with hopes and dreams." The challenge of marketing a modular system doesn't end with the chubbiness problem. "We sadly live in a disposable society and people do have an expectation that they will change their phone every so often," says Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight (and proud owner of more than 800 handsets going back two decades). How long people hang on to a handset varies across the world. On average it's just over three years, but in the US it's just 20 months. Although new devices are almost always bought on a contract, people have come to regard their new phone as a "free upgrade". Lots of us wait impatiently for upgrade day - phone technology is advancing so fast that multiple components, though still functional, feel outdated after a couple of years. However, this trend may not continue indefinitely, Wood says. Mobile phones could be approaching an "innovation plateau" where the basics like speed and screen resolution are as good as they can get. Add to this the regular software "drops" that make our phones feel like new, and people might start hanging on to their handsets for longer. In this kind of market, Phonebloks might become viable, Wood argues. Home computers reached an innovation plateau some years ago, but while we replace our computers less frequently than we used to, not many of us exploit the modular nature of our PCs and upgrade the modules. However, in Hakkens's view that's because it isn't easy enough - only "die-hard geeks" are willing to reach for a screwdriver to unscrew their memory or motherboard. Price is arguably the least important factor in the mobile phone market, but it may represent another challenge for Phonebloks. In the long run, you might think consumers would save money with a modular system that can be continually upgraded and never needs chucking out, but this may not be the case. Big phone companies achieve enormous efficiencies of scale by negotiating special rates with parts manufacturers, buying up production capacity for months at a time. In return, the parts manufacturers get investment for research and development and a guarantee of future business. The idea of marketing "bloks" to end-consumers through a "blokstore" might not be so appealing to these companies, which might in turn prevent similar economies of scale being achieved. Hakkens recognises that neither the big phone companies nor the manufacturers that work with them are likely to jump at his idea - he sees it as a chance for other electronics companies to enter the fray. He says he has been approached by a number of companies and individuals excited about getting involved. "Right now, I'm thinking about what would be the best next step," he says. "Would it be to build it myself, open-source, online - or partner up with companies and collaborators?" He seems to have been caught off guard by the attention his little idea is receiving. "I wasn't planning to do a next step," he admits, "but now I have all these people offering help." Kyle Wiens and Ben Wood are enthusiastic about Phonebloks, but they both believe the concept might end in a half-way house - a phone in which the battery and screen, and possibly the memory and camera, can be easily replaced. For Wiens, the key to making a green phone is different - a design durable enough for the device to reach a second-hand market. "The whole phone doesn't need to be modular so long as it can be repaired and kept in service," he says. Dave Hakkens doesn't pretend to have all the answers, or even certainty that Phonebloks will see the light of day. "Half of the world says it's possible, the other half says it's not possible," he says. "I don't think anyone really knows because no-one's really tried it. So that's the next thing to do - just figure it out." Dave Hakkens spoke to Click on the BBC World Service - listen again to the programme on iPlayer or get the Click podcast.

      <title>Leah Busque: Taskrabbit's early days</title>
      <description>How errand-running site grew by leaps and bounds</description>

      <body>One thing many entrepreneurs have in common is the way they respond to problems they find irritating or annoying. Instead of just accepting the frustrations they encounter, they try to do something to fix the situation. The result can often be a new kind of business. For Leah Busque, founder of online errand-running business Taskrabbit, the event that caused her to start a company happened one evening when she and her husband had just called a cab to take them to meet friends for dinner. "We realised we had run out of dog food," she says. At the time the couple lived in Boston, Massachusetts, where Ms Busque worked at IBM as a software engineer. Worried that all the shops would be closed on their way home, she and her husband began discussing the problem. "My husband's also in technology, so we've always had these very geeky conversations," she says. "And that night it turned into, 'Wouldn't it be nice if there was just a place online we could go, say we needed dog food, name the price we're willing to pay?' "We were certain that there was someone in our own neighbourhood that would be willing to help us out, and it was just a matter of connecting with them." Before she left the house that evening, Ms Busque used her phone to register an internet domain name for her new business idea. A few months later, she left her job at IBM to work full time on the project. Once they've hit on what they think is a good idea, many entrepreneurs keep it to themselves, fearful that others might steal it. Leah Busque took the opposite approach. She says she talked to "anyone who would listen - family, friends, the guy sitting next to me on the bus, the person in the coffee shop, it didn't matter". She noticed that out of hundreds of conversations "no-one said, 'You're insane. This is not a good idea.' Everyone was like, 'Why doesn't this exist yet?'" Convinced there was a real potential market, she pressed on with her plan. "Ignorance is bliss, I think, when you're first starting out," she says. "I wasn't thinking about starting a company, about raising money, about hiring. I was just thinking, I have to build this idea in my head." Ms Busque began by putting an advertisement on Craigslist, an online classified advertising service, seeking people to help her try out her idea. She was surprised by the response. "I thought I would get all these college students involved that would want to make extra money… but that actually wasn't the case at all," she says. As well as students, there were enquiries from retired people and out-of-work professionals such as lawyers, pharmacists and teachers. But, Ms Busque says, the idea resonated most of all with working mothers. This group seemed not only to be interested in part-time work as errand-runners, but also in becoming customers of the service. "They were trying to balance work and life and kids, and they would love for someone to deliver their groceries or pick up the dry cleaning," Ms Busque says. For her experimental run, Ms Busque spent many hours in local coffee shops interviewing about 100 people, picking 30 of them to take part. The experience helped her later on, when she was developing a more automated vetting and background-checking system for errand-runners. Ms Busque's plan involved creating an online marketplace, where customers who wanted small tasks done could connect with people willing to carry them out. Customers would invite bids for various jobs. The company would offer guidance on pricing for many popular tasks and would take a percentage of the price paid, to cover its costs. A reputation ranking system and profiles of errand-runners would help customers to choose the right person for their job. After a successful small-scale trial, Ms Busque set about building an enterprise. A chance conversation led her to contact Scott Griffith, who was chief executive of car-sharing business Zipcar at the time. Mr Griffith liked the sound of her plans and offered her space in the Zipcar offices while she got the business off the ground. "It was an incredible opportunity," says Ms Busque. "I got to watch [Scott] run a 200-person company and grow it and scale it and raise money of his own right before my eyes." Despite this help, turning an idea into a business was not easy, particularly in late 2008 and 2009. "It was a really tough time to be raising money," says Ms Busque. "We were in a recession. Investors were not investing. And so that was incredibly stressful and took up a lot of time and energy and a lot of late nights wondering if we should continue or not." Ms Busque persisted in her efforts to find backers. A breakthrough came after she spent several weeks attending a business incubator programme in California, run by social networking giant Facebook. "It was kind of like a start-up boot camp - I just learned so much," she says. Partly through connections she made through the incubator programme, she was able to put together a round of seed-funding, so she could take her business to the next stage. It was Ms Busque's first visit to the west coast of the US, and she found the atmosphere of Silicon Valley inspiring. She decided to open a second base in San Francisco, which is where the company now has its headquarters. The firm now operates in several US cities. It is also looking to expand overseas and is planning to launch an operation in the UK soon. Taskrabbit is just one example of a player in the so-called "sharing economy", where firms attempt to use the internet to make better use of facilities that have spare capacity. Other examples include car-ride sharing firm Zimride, wi-fi access sharing business FON, and Airbnb, which enables home owners to rent out spare rooms as holiday accommodation. Compared with, say, a manufacturing business, an internet-based company might seem fairly easy to set up. It also means that online businesses might find they have more competitors than traditional ones. Certainly, Taskrabbit has not found its path to be completely smooth. In July, the company had to lose some staff. Taskrabbit has expanded from domestic errands into offering help to businesses - a field currently dominated by some huge temporary employment agencies. Ms Busque says she's not worried about competition from big players. "The temporary labour industry is one that hasn't been reinvented in decades, and so it's prime for disruption," she says. "We're really excited about tackling that market." It remains to be seen whether Leah Busque and her errand-runners are equal to the task. </body>

      <body>Actors David Tennant and Olivia Coleman have helped ITV's Broadchurch win four prizes - dubbed the Daggers - at the Specsavers Crime Thriller Awards. The pair picked up the best actor and actress awards for their roles in the drama, with co-star Andrew Buchan named best supporting actor. Broadchurch also won the TV prize, with Bond movie Skyfall named best film. Martina Cole and Wilbur Smith were also inducted into the Crime Writers' Association Hall of Fame at the event. The pair were honoured in recognition of their contributions to the genre. The awards - which marked the culmination of ITV3's Crime Thriller Book Club - included a new award for the club's best read, which went to Malcolm MacKay for The Necessary Death Of Lewis Winter. After beating books by Linwood Barclay, Megan Abbott, Christopher Fowler, Diana Bretherick and Andrew Taylor, the author said it was "a huge honour and thrill to win". Mick Herron picked up the coveted Gold Dagger award for best crime novel of the year for Dead Lions. "My shelves are crammed with Gold Dagger-winning novels of the past - The Mermaids Singing, Black and Blue, Bones and Silence. I can't quite believe I get to put my own book next to them," he said. The best new crime writer prize went to Derek B Miller for his debut novel Norwegian By Night Roger, while Roger Hobbs's Ghostman was named best thriller of the year. Other awards went to Amelia Bullmore, who won best supporting actress for her role in ITV's Scott and Bailey, while Danish series The Killing III won the best international TV prize. The ceremony will be shown on ITV3 on 27 October at 21:00GMT. </body>

      <body>British actor Tim Roth is to star as Fifa president Sepp Blatter in a film about football's governing body. Provisionally titled F2014, Gerard Depardieu will also appear in the movie as Jules Rimet - one of Fifa's founders and its longest-serving president. In a video published on Fifa's website, Blatter said Roth's casting was "well done" and they had "common qualities". The film is due for release next year, to coincide with Fifa's 110th anniversary and the World Cup. Production will take place in France, Brazil and Azerbaijan. The video showed Blatter meeting with Roth for the first time in Zurich, which Blatter said was "a very interesting get-together". "I had read a lot of the CV and all the [films] that Tim Roth has made [and] I was very eager to meet him," the 77-year-old said. The movie is being made by French production companies Leuviah and Thelma Films. Blatter has run Fifa since 1998 amid a series of controversies including allegations of corruption. In 2004 the Swiss was criticised for suggesting female footballers should wear tighter shorts and low cut shirts to attract more male fans, while in 2011 he insisted there was no racism in football and any incidents could be settled with a handshake. He was also at the centre of allegations of bribery resulting in Qatar's successful 2022 World Cup bid and was criticised for saying gay football fans should not have sex while in the nation, where homosexuality is illegal. He has since apologised for his remarks. Roth, 52, will soon be seen on the big screen as Prince Rainier of Monaco, opposite Nicole Kidman in Grace of Monaco. </body>

      <body>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Live!, a touring stage show based on Douglas Adams cult book, has been cancelled due to poor ticket sales. The Radio Theatre Company, which produced the show, said it regretted the cancellation, which was announced ahead of a performance in Crawley. "In the last 24 hours we have had no option but make the extremely hard and painful decision to stop the tour." All remaining dates in October and November tour have been pulled. Ticket holders have been advised to contact the venue for refunds. "Although a well-loved show, Hitchhiker's Live has been subject to the same extreme economic pressures as many productions touring the UK this autumn," producers said, in a statement posted on its website. "Ticket sales across the board have been lower than average and we have not escaped this trend. "A difficult financial environment for such a large and technical show means that covering operating costs has become impossible." "We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this may cause and share the extreme disappointment and frustration felt by many who were looking forward to seeing the show. We sincerely hope that it can be brought back in the future." 'Devastated' In a joint statement with director Dirk Maggs, Simon Jones, who played Arthur Dent in the show, wrote on his Facebook page: "With infinite regret, despite happy audiences and 5 star reviews, we have been forced to curtail this tour ahead of schedule due to economic adversity. " "Having worked so hard to put on a show worthy of Douglas Adams and his devoted fans, we are utterly devastated. "It has been a pleasure to be a part of a company, band and crew who have become a close knit family. We know people hoping to see the show will be as horribly disappointed as we are, and offer our heartfelt apologies for any inconvenience this has caused. The show, which kicked off its UK tour in 2012, reunited members of the original radio and TV cast including Mark Wing-Davey and Geoff McGivern. The voice of the book was played by a series of guest performers including Hugh Dennis and Anita Dobson. </body>

      <body>Singer Manolo Escobar, whose best-selling track Y Viva Espana became part of Spain's cultural identity in the 1970s, has died aged 82. Escobar died at home in the town of Benidorm surrounded by his family, after a long fight against cancer. He was "a symbol who lived in the musical landscape of Spaniards for half a century," Spain's culture minister, Jose Ignacio Wert, said in a statement. "Music is my life," Escobar said this month. "I will never surrender." "I am happy because I have work and because, moreover, people are still prepared to pay to see me on stage," the singer said in an interview with Spanish newspaper ABC. "I want to return to a few of the places I have been to in my career of more than 50 years and say goodbye for good. I will sing one more time in each one so that I don't go back," he added. Born in a small village outside Almeria in October 1931, Escobar had a huge following in Spain in the 1960s and 1970s with hits such as El Porompompero and Mi Carro. A well-known personality thanks to his television show Canta Manolo Escobar, he also starred in films including The Guerrillas and Father Manolo, in which he played a singing priest. But it was the success of Y Viva Espana, in 1973, that made him an international star. The track was based on Eviva Espana, the 1971 song written by Belgian duo Leo Rozenstraten and Leo Caerts, and performed, in Dutch, by Samantha. Escobar's best-selling single - released to coincide with Spain's transition from dictatorship to democracy and a boom in international tourism - sold an estimated six million copies. In 1974, the track was covered by Swedish singer Sylvia Vrethammar, whose English version reached number four in the UK Singles Chart. One of Escobar's last big acts was in July 2010 when he sang with the Spanish football team to celebrate their victory in the World Cup in South Africa. He announced his retirement from music at the end of 2012 after 50 years on the stage. Last month, he had to cancel the final dates of his farewell tour after falling ill. He was undergoing treatment, reportedly for colon cancer, at Benidorm's Hospital Clinica, but is understood to have left on Tuesday. He died at home two days later. Escobar leaves a wife, Anita, and one daughter, Vanessa. </body>

      <body>An Edinburgh author has been named the winner of the Edinburgh International Book Festival's 2013 First Book Award. Angela Jackson, one of 42 writers in contention, said it felt "particularly special" to win the prize for her debut novel, The Emergence of Judy Taylor. Visitors to this year's festival voted her book ahead of other first works by such authors as Gill Hornby, sister of Nick, and broadcaster Dawn O'Porter. Jackson's novel tells of a dissatisfied wife who embarks on a new life. "It's great to know I'm on the right track [and] that my work is connecting with readers," the author continued. The former musician and psychology lecturer said the prize would "spur [her] on to complete my second novel". Nick Barley, director of the Edinburgh International Book Festival, said Jackson's triumph was "a wonderful, home-grown success story". "Angela gave her first public reading at the Book Festival in 2010 and appeared again in 2011," he continued. "We were delighted to welcome her this year as a fully fledged and published author." Edinburgh's book festival, held every August in the city's Charlotte Square Gardens, celebrated its 30th anniversary this year. </body>

      <title>Sculptor Sir Anthony Caro dies</title>
      <description>British sculptor Sir Anthony Caro, widely regarded as one of the greatest of his generation, dies at the age of 89.</description>

      <body>British sculptor Sir Anthony Caro has died of a heart attack at the age of 89, his family has confirmed. Sir Anthony was widely regarded as the greatest British sculptor of his generation and worked as an assistant to Henry Moore in the 1950s. Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota called him "one of the outstanding sculptors of the past 50 years". Among his many prizes was 2008's Jack Goldhill Award for Sculpture for his piece Promenade. Awarded by the Royal Academy of Arts, the £10,000 prize goes to the creator of "an outstanding piece of sculpture". The artist had vowed to keep working until he was 100, as he unveiled his most recent exhibition at the Gagosian Gallery in London in June. He told The Independent: "It's what I like doing. Old age is a shock, but I still enjoy making the works." "I look forward to going into the studio. I would be bored if I didn't do that." Sir Anthony played a pivotal role in the development of 20th Century sculpture, after first coming to public attention with a show at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1963. There, he exhibited large abstract sculptures, such as Early One Morning (1962), which were brightly painted and stood directly on the ground to engage the spectator on a one-to-one basis. It was a radical departure from the way sculpture had been seen in the past and paved the way for future developments in three-dimensional art. "I did break something open at the beginning," Sir Anthony said in June. "A tremendous lot of possibilities opened up to me when that happened, and I've been exploring these different areas for the rest of my life." The artist added: "Sculpture did have some assumptions and some, well, rules almost and I broke those rules." He was born in Surrey in 1924 and studied engineering at Christ's College Cambridge, before going on to specialise in sculpture at the Royal Academy Schools in London until 1952. Sir Anthony then went on to influence others as a teacher at St Martin's School of Art in London from 1953 to 1981. There he inspired a younger generation of British sculptors including Phillip King, Tony Cragg, Barry Flanagan, Richard Long and Gilbert and George. In the early 1950s he had started his own sculpting career by making rugged bronze animal and human figures, which were said to be concerned with "what it is like to be inside the body". His more famous later work, which questioned assumptions about form, material and subject matter in sculpture, can currently be seen in a major exhibition at The Museo Correr in Venice until 27 October. In a statement following his death, Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota called him "a man of great humility and humanity whose abundant creativity, even as he approached the age of 90, was still evident in the most recent work". Sir Anthony was also awarded the Praemium Imperiale for Sculpture in Tokyo in 1992 and the Lifetime Achievement Award for Sculpture in 1997. He was knighted in 1987 and received the Order of Merit in May 2000, which recognises great achievement in the fields of the arts, learning, literature and science, and he was the subject of a major retrospective at Tate Britain in 2005. With Norman Foster and Tony Fitzpatrick he co-designed London's landmark Millennium Bridge, but the £18.2m project had to be closed down three days after it was opened in June 2000, as it swayed "alarmingly". Engineers blamed the "synchronised footfall" effect of hundreds of people stepping in unison and it was reopened nearly two years in February 2002, after £5m of modifications. Sir Anthony was married to painter Sheila Girling, with whom he had two sons and three grandchildren. He had a close relationship with the Royal Academy of Arts throughout his career and chief executive Charles Saumarez Smith has paid tribute to the late Royal Academician. "Sir Anthony Caro OM CBE RA was one of the greatest sculptors in the second half of the twentieth century," said Saumarez Smith. "He was elected as a Senior Member of the Royal Academy on 9 March 2004 and will be much missed by the RA as well as his friends and admirers internationally." </body>

      <title>Jailed artist wins portrait prize</title>
      <description>Australian artist Nigel Milsom, who was jailed earlier this year for robbing a convenience store while high on drugs, has won the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize</description>

      <body>A prominent Australian artist who was jailed earlier this year for robbing a convenience store while high on drugs has won a major national art prize. Nigel Milsom was awarded the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize, winning $150,000, for his portrait Uncle Paddy. He pleaded guilty to robbing a 7-11 store in Sydney in April 2012. He later apologised to police, saying he thought he was "buying doughnuts". Milsom, a former security guard, is serving six years for armed robbery. The artist, who suffers from depression, completed the painting earlier this year while on bail awaiting sentencing for the crime. The winning portrait was picked by 2009 Moran Prize winner Ben Quilty and ex-Art Gallery of South Australia director Daniel Thomas, who were not told the names of the artists. "The fact is it was the best painting," Quilty told the Australian newspaper. "I judged the painting, not him." "Even someone who has gotten into some state of punishment for whatever he did could come good," said judge Daniel Thomas . "So that's how I reconciled myself with Milsom getting that money." He praised Milsom's "extraordinarily refined technique, the brushwork, so smooth, so delicate". Uncle Paddy depicts one of Milsom's grandfather's oldest friends; Thomas called it "a very old-fashioned Australian face". "There is a quiet sadness about Paddy that seems to stem from the realisation that death will be visiting him soon, too," said Milsom. "When I painted his portrait I got a sense that he has learnt to sit with this feeling of sadness, which has given him a greater strength and wisdom." The Moran Prize, which annually awards contemporary Australian portraiture, is now in its 25th year. All the winning pictures become part of the Moran Arts Foundation Collection. Last year Milsom won the $30,000 art prize for the 2012 Sulman Prize. Weeks later, armed with a knife, axe and a fake gun, he and another man threatened to kill a shopkeeper while holding him hostage in the store room of a 7-11 store, reported the Telegraph. "My state of mind is hard to describe ... I thought I was buying doughnuts,'" he told the court earlier this year. "It felt like I was watching something as a movie that wasn't really happening." At the time of the crime, the court heard the artist had recently lost his mentor, art curator Nick Waterlow, and his sister, and was high on a combination of heroin, crystal meth, prescription drugs and alcohol. </body>

      <title>Alan Davies pays damages over tweet</title>
      <description>Comedian Alan Davies pays damages after retweeting a post linking Tory peer Lord McAlpine's name to a TV report on paedophilia, the High Court hears.</description>

      <body>Comedian Alan Davies has paid damages after he retweeted a post linking a Tory peer's name to a TV report on a "senior political figure who is a paedophile", the High Court has heard. Mr Davies apologised for the "great damage and distress" his post caused ex-Conservative Party deputy chairman Lord McAlpine, his lawyer said. He accepted the "allegations" were "completely untrue", his lawyer added. Lord McAlpine's solicitor said his client accepted Davies' apology. But speaking after the hearing at the London court, Andrew Reid added: "The fact remains that both he [Lord McAlpine] and his family have been caused immeasurable distress which cannot be rectified. "There still remain people influenced by this tweet and all the apologies in the world are not going to put the situation back to where it was." Mr Davies said he "stood by" the public apology he issued at the time and had made a donation of £13,000 to the NSPCC in an attempt to make amends. "I hoped those steps might avoid legal action but in March press reports appeared saying I was going to be sued for £200,000," he said in a statement issued after the hearing. "I offered to pay £15,000 in damages plus a contribution to costs and agreed to make today's statement in court. "From my own experience, I am able to warn others of the dangers of retweeting." During the hearing, which neither Lord McAlpine nor Mr Davies attended, lawyers for both outlined details of the libel action to the judge, Mr Justice Tugendhat. Sir Edward Garnier QC, for Lord McAlpine, said on 2 November last year the then "managing editor of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism" tweeted: "If all goes well we've got a Newsnight out tonight about a very senior political figure who is a paedophile." Sir Edward said the prospect prompted further Twitter activity. Newsnight broadcast the report about the sexual abuse of boys at the Bryn Estyn children's home in Wrexham, Clwyd, in the 1970s and 1980s, and accused an unnamed "leading Conservative politician from the Thatcher years of sexually abusing boys in care". Sir Edward said that, prior to the broadcast, Mr Davies tweeted: "Any clues who this Tory paedophile is...?" He said a few minutes later Mr Davies received a reply which contained links to three websites, including to an article about an inquiry into abuse at the Bryn Estyn home and to a Swedish website which "purported to report on a paedophile ring in the British establishment". Sir Edward said the reply tweet then said "lord mcalpine, some would say". He added: "Most unfortunately, Mr Davies retweeted that tweet. At the time he had a substantial number of followers on Twitter - in excess of 400,000." Mr Davies' lawyer Steve Hudson told the judge: "Mr Davies withdraws the allegation made on Twitter unreservedly and apologises sincerely to Lord McAlpine for the great damage and distress his tweeting has caused him." He added: "Mr Davies hopes that as a result of this matter other Twitter users will be more aware of the potential damaging consequences of tweeting and be more careful in how they use that platform." On Tuesday, Lord McAlpine's libel action against Sally Bercow, wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow, was formally settled at the same court. Mrs Bercow had already apologised and paid the peer undisclosed damages for a defamatory tweet linking Lord McAlpine to false claims of child sex abuse allegations. Meanwhile, Ofcom has upheld complaints over episodes of Newsnight and This Morning that led to the peer being wrongly implicated. Lord McAlpine was not named but the watchdog ruled that airing the claims while there was internet speculation about the alleged abuser's identity had led to Lord McAlpine being incorrectly identified. </body>

      <body>The centenary of World War I is to be marked in a National Portrait Gallery show of paintings, films and sculptures inspired by the conflict. The Great War in Portraits will run at the central London gallery from 27 February until 15 June, 2014. The exhibition will include two films made about the Battle of the Somme from different sides of the lines. It will also feature portraits of Sir Winston Churchill and war poets Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon. Paintings and photographs of soldiers decorated for bravery will be shown alongside prisoners of war, the wounded and those shot at dawn for cowardice. Major loans on display will include expressionist artworks by Lovis Corinth and Max Beckmann and Ludwig Kirchner's Selbstbildnis als Soldat - Self-portrait as a Soldier. Also on show will be portraits of the generals who plotted the course of the war and a photograph of assassin Gavrilo Princip whose murder of Archduke Franz Ferdinand triggered the conflict. Other highlights will include Jacob Epstein's The Rock Drill, one of the great early modernist works related to the war, and a rare photograph by Jules Gervais Courtellemont depicting a battle-scarred, deserted landscape. The gallery will host a range of activities linked to the centenary including two special performances by the Portrait Choir inspired by the war. Exhibition curator Paul Moorhouse said: "The Great War in Portraits explores a complex range of human experience. "Evolving different roles, responsibilities and destinies, it illuminates the way war was represented through portraits of individuals - each caught up in events beyond reason or control." </body>

      <body>Rebecca Stead has won this year's Guardian children's fiction prize for her novel Liar And Spy, about an 11-year-old boy who hides from reality by pretending to be a detective. She is the first US-based author to win, after changes to the rules. Stead's competition included The Fault In Our Stars by John Green, David Almond's The Boy Who Swam with Piranhas and Katherine Rundell's Rooftoppers. Judges said Liar And Spy, Stead's third novel, was "incredibly sensitive". "Its central characters are all children who have complexities in their lives which they are dealing with," said Julia Eccleshare, The Guardian's children's books editor and chair of the judges. "It's a novel about how children have to navigate the world. It is a quiet book, but although the drama is finely-tuned, the overall impact is powerful, moving and surprising," she said. All of Stead's novels are set in New York, where she grew up, and where Liar And Spy's main character Georges is nicknamed "Gorgeous" at school because of the silent "s" his parents have included in his name. His life gets steadily worse when he moves into a new apartment block as his dad loses his job and his mum has to work longer shifts. He then gets caught up in a spying game with another boy living in the block and embarks on a journey of self-discovery. Lottie Longshanks, one of the winners of the Young Critics Competition 2013 - also announced on Wednesday night - told The Guardian it was "a very well written story, with lots of quirky characters and some important messages". Stead, whose second book When You Reach Me won the 2010 Newbery medal, is a former lawyer who turned to writing after the birth of her children. She told the newspaper she was inspired by the "tough time" she had negotiating her school years. "I felt vulnerable and very much between friends. This wasn't because I had some horrific bullying story, but because of a steady drip of negativity," said Stead. "I was thinking about how something so un-sensational, so un-dramatic, coloured my life so completely." The prize, which was founded in 1967, comes with a cheque for £1,500 and was opened up to writers who are not resident in the UK last year. It is awarded annually to fiction written for children aged eight and above, and is the only children's fiction award selected by fellow writers. The judging panel also included Andy Mulligan, winner of the 2011 Guardian children's fiction prize, Jason Wallace, author of Out of the Shadows, which won the Costa award in 2010, and Binny for Short writer Hilary McKay, who won the Guardian prize in 1992. </body>

"Congratulations to those poets who made it and those who didn't, so much of whose work I read with enormous delight and envy." The shortlist was chosen from 113 books submitted by publishers.

"Stow your twitchy palms ladies ... our man is here," confirmed Fifty Shades author EL James on Twitter. He is expected to sign up for at least three films based on the book trilogy. Published in 2011, Fifty Shades of Grey follows the sexually-charged relationship between billionaire Grey and college student Anastasia Steele, who will be played by Dakota Johnson - daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith. The novel and its two sequels, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, have become a literary phenomenon that earned author James a reported $95m (£61.5m) last year. There has been intense speculation over who will star in the film adaptation, which will be directed by another Briton, artist Sam Taylor-Johnson. Dornan is understood to have screen-tested for the role before Hunnam was cast, reports Variety. Universal Studios have yet to officially confirm his casting. Hunnam dropped out of the role earlier this month. Universal Pictures said his sudden departure was a mutual decision due to a scheduling problem with the actor's TV commitments. However, there have been reports that the Sons of Anarchy actor had been overwhelmed by the media attention. He was also reported to have been dissatisfied with Kelly Marcel's screen adaptation. Closer's Patrick Marber, who was Oscar-nominated for his Notes on a Scandal screenplay, is currently working on the screenplay, with Universal hoping to begin shooting next month. </body>

      <body>Dark Knight Rises star Tom Hardy will play Sir Elton John in a biopic of the singer's life called Rocketman, it has been announced. The 36-year-old British actor previously played Bane in The Dark Knight Rises and has starred in films such as Inception, Lawless and Bronson. Rocketman is being made with the co-operation of Sir Elton, 66, who is an executive producer on the project. It will begin shooting in late 2014, Focus Features said. The screenplay has been penned by Lee Hall, who was Oscar-nominated for Billy Elliot, and recently worked on the film adaptation of War Horse. It follows Reginald Dwight's journey from childhood piano prodigy to global superstar, under his stage name Elton John. Hardy is respected for his wide-ranging talent, but his brawny, tattooed frame makes him an unconventional choice to star as the flamboyant musician. He is not the first actor to play Sir Elton. In 2001, Justin Timberlake appeared as a "young Elton" in the video for the latter's This Train Don't Stop There Any More. Last month, Sir Elton John played live at the Emmy Awards ceremony for the first time. He performed a tribute to Liberace, the American pianist and vocalist whose life was told in the recent biopic, Behind the Candelabra. </body>

      <title>Tim Rice unveils Eternity musical</title>

      <body>Sir Tim Rice has unveiled his new West End show From Here to Eternity, admitting that it might leave some audience members "mildly shocked". The adaptation of James Jones' uncensored 1951 novel is Sir Tim's first totally new musical for 13 years. Written with composer Stuart Brayson, the story follows the love affairs of US soldiers stationed in Hawaii in the run-up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. The new version includes swearing, nudity and a scene in a gay bar. Some of the more explicit scenes will come as a surprise to fans of the 1953 Oscar-winning film, starring Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr, which included a famous scene in which the couple share a passionate clinch on a beach. "The film was wonderful but it was made in 1953 and, 60 years on, we can take different aspects of the book and look at it through 21st Century eyes," Sir Tim told the BBC after Wednesday's opening night. "Some people might be mildly shocked but I think we've all got used to a bit of that these days. It's quite mild compared with Book of Mormon or even Billy Elliot." The cast includes Darius Campbell as Sergeant Warden, Rebecca Thornhill as his married lover Karen Holmes, Robert Lonsdale as Private Prewitt, Siubhan Harrison as his lover Lorene, and Ryan Sampson as Private Maggio. Campbell said that, during previews, there had been some walkouts from the show due to its content. "The James Jones novel really portrayed homosexuality and prostitution in the way that it existed in those days and we've dived in head first. We've explored that in a way that's very real and gritty, and honours the story." The Scottish singing star, who shot to fame as Darius Danesh on TV show Pop Idol, went on: "It hasn't been without some of the older audience walking out. "Maybe some of the nudity, swearing and explicitness have been too much for them, but a younger audience and an audience who have loved the film - and wanted to see more - have been giving us standing ovations and for that we are all grateful." 'Quite dangerous' Sir Tim Rice is best known for his partnership with Andrew Lloyd Webber on shows such as Joseph and his Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita. Lord Lloyd-Webber's new West End musical Stephen Ward is due to open in December. Sir Tim confirmed that his former writing partner had already seen a preview of From Here to Eternity. "He was very complimentary and I'm hoping to see his show," he said. Sir Tim's last full musical was 2000's Aida, which he wrote with Elton John. The pair had earlier worked together on The Lion King. From Here to Eternity sees the Oscar-winning lyricist team up with the relatively unknown Brayson. The pair first met in the 1980s when Brayson approached Sir Tim in the street and asked him to listen one of his songs on cassette. "I played it in car on way home. I rang him up and said this is rather good. I couldn't do much to help his pop career but when he began writing musicals I thought, 'maybe I can help,'" Sir Tim said. Although Sir Tim hadn't intended to be involved in writing the musical, as the production took shape he "ended up doing all the lyrics apart from one or two lines". Brayson told the BBC: "I must have sent him eight or nine musicals and this was the one that he really went for. "We didn't set out to do the movie. We set out out to do something that was different and quite dangerous in parts." In the audience on Wednesday night was James Jones' daughter, Kaylie, and her brother, Jamie. "We had our doubts when the idea first came up," she admitted after the show, "but I'm thrilled - it's so sophisticated and moving." She added: "I was so delighted they put in the gay bar scenes because my dad said this is just the way it was back then. "I think my father would have been amazed." From Here to Eternity, directed by Tamara Harvey, is booking at the Shaftesbury Theatre, London, until 26 April 2014. </body>

      <title>Nude Turner Prize model criticised</title>
      <description>A Turner Prize sculpture of a nude man causes controversy among schools in Northern Ireland.</description>

      <body>A Turner Prize sculpture of a nude man has caused controversy among some schools in Northern Ireland. The prestigious exhibition opened to the public in Londonderry on Wednesday morning, the first time it has been taken outside of England. The entries are on show at former Army barracks at Ebrington. Derry is the UK City of Culture 2013. David Shrigley's naked model has been avoided by a number of schools because it shows a man urinating into a bucket. Glasgow-based Shrigley is best known for his humorous line drawings, but also makes sculptures, photographs, paintings and animated films. His work, which combines jokes and commentary, can be found on greeting cards, in books and in magazines, as well as in galleries. Schools from across Northern Ireland have been invited to the exhibition. Ann Murray, the principal of Oakgrove Integrated Primary School in Derry, said: "This particular piece of art is too much for some students. "We have younger people at the school, so I'd rather have their parents take them to see Shrigley's piece rather than the school. "We talked about Shrigley's piece, but we avoided that particular gallery. "Some parents may find it really offensive." Jack Malvern, the arts correspondent with The Times newspaper, said: "I personally don't think it's offensive. "What we have here is teachers who are worried about parents' potential reactions rather than their actual reactions. "If one parent says no then the entire class is excluded. It's a shame. "There is nothing offensive about this, it's humorous. "When I was speaking to people in Derry they told me that you have to take into consideration local sensitivities. They said they are a more socially conservative society." Denis Feeney, vice principal of St John's Primary School in Derry, said: "We didn't go to the Shrigley piece because it just wasn't appropriate. "The Turner experience was fantastic all round, but we thought it was just a bit much." Established in 1984, the Turner Prize is awarded to a contemporary artist under 50, living, working or born in Britain, who is judged to have put on the best exhibition of the last 12 months. The winner will receive £25,000 and the result will be announced on 2 December. The other shortlisted artists will each receive £5,000. </body>

      <body>The female head of the Qatar Museums Authority (QMA) has been named the most powerful figure in the art world. Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani came top of ArtReview magazine's annual Power 100 due to "her organisation's vast purchasing power". Sheikha Al-Mayassa first appeared on the Power 100 in 2011 at number 90, rising to number 11 in 2012. China's Ai Weiwei, who topped the countdown in 2011, is the highest-placed artist at number nine. Other familiar names in the top 10 include art dealer Larry Gagosian, ranked at four, and Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota, placed at six. The latter was made a Companion of Honour by Prince Charles on Wednesday at Buckingham Palace in recognition of his services to art. Sheikha Al-Mayassa is the sister of Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, who assumed the role of Qatar's emir when his father abdicated in June. According to ArtReview, the QMA spends around $1bn a year (£618m) developing galleries, sponsoring film festivals and supporting public art. It also sponsored Tate Modern's Damien Hirst exhibition, which attracted more than 463,000 visitors during its run last year. Last year's Power 100 was also topped by a woman - Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev, the curator of the influential Documenta 13 exhibition in Kassel, Germany. David Zwirner, who owns galleries in London and New York, is in second place in this year's rundown, while his former business partner Iwan Wirth is ranked at three. Sir Nicholas comes just behind Hans Ulrich Obrist and Julia Peyton-Jones, the co-creators of the Serpentine galleries in London. Compiled by a 13-member international jury, the Power 100 is described as "a unique snapshot of the contemporary art scene". According to the contemporary art magazine, those included are "judged on their international influence over the production of art and contribution to the art world during the past 12 months". </body>

      <body>An Italian supreme court ruling has put an end to a 39-year legal dispute between Oscar-winning film star Sophia Loren and Italian tax authorities. The argument centred around Loren's earnings in 1974. She claimed tax was owed on 60% of her income, but the state said it should be 70%. The Court of Cassation ruled in her favour, saying the actress's earnings were covered by a 1982 tax amnesty. "A saga that has lasted nearly 40 years is finally over," said Loren. "I always look to the future and I leave bad experiences like this one behind me," she was quoted as saying by the La Stampa daily newspaper. Her lawyer, Giovanni Desideri, said: "The supreme court has wrapped up a Kafkaesque case." Loren, who was born Sofia Scicolone and started her film career in 1950, famously spent 17 days in prison in 1982 in a separate tax dispute - an incident that drew her fans to the jail near Naples. She said at the time that her tax specialist had erred, meaning her tax return understated her earnings by about 5 million lire (then $7,000). Entering the prison, she said she was being subjected to "an unjust situation due to a little mistake by a tax specialist". The actress shot to fame internationally when she acted alongside Cary Grant in the 1958 film Houseboat. She won an Oscar for her heart-rending performance in 1961 film Two Women about a mother raped while protecting her daughter in war-torn Italy. In July, she was photographed on the set of a film version of Jean Cocteau's 1930 play La Voix Humaine - The Human Voice - which will be directed by her son Edoardo Ponti. </body>

      <body>Animated snail-racing tale Turbo has beaten Tom Hanks's true-life hostage drama Captain Phillips to the top of this week's UK box office. The Dreamworks film earned £3.9m including previews, compared with the £3.4m of Hanks's Paul Greengrass-directed thriller. Action stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone's prison break film Escape Plan was third with £961,470. The top five was rounded off by Prisoners and Sunshine on Leith. This week's figures are a lift on the previous seven days when Prisoners topped the chart for a third consecutive week, in a weekend which saw no release make more than £1m. Turbo, which features the voices of Ryan Reynolds and rapper Snoop Dogg, flopped when it was released in the US earlier this year, earning $21m (£13m) over its first weekend. With a reported budget of $135m (£83.6m) it only made $82.6m (£51.2m) in North America during its run, although it has since earned more than $224m (£139m) worldwide. Hanks, meanwhile, has won rave reviews for his role in the film about a container ship seized by Somali pirates in the Indian Ocean in 2009. The film opened this year's London Film Festival. Bollywood action film Boss, starring Akshay Kumar, opened at number nine despite opening in just 63 screens. Averaging £3,732 per cinema, it took significantly more than Escape Plan's average of £2,656 per location across 362 screens. Romantic drama Enough Said, starring Sopranos actor James Gandolfini in one of his final film roles opposite Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, missed out on a top 10 place but earned a respectable £170,357 from its 79 screens. While a second bad week for Wikileaks drama The Fifth Estate, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Julian Assange, saw it fall out of the top 10 to 13 after taking £118,397. </body>

      <body>Tim Burton is in talks to direct Michael Keaton in Beetlejuice 2, according to Hollywood trade magazines. Burton directed the first cult hit movie, which was released in 1988 and starred Keaton as a fast-talking, devious ghost from the underworld. The Frankenweenie director is currently working on the film Big Eyes, before going on to direct Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. The original Beetlejuice spawned an animated TV series produced by Burton. The film also starred Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin and Winona Ryder. Burton has been nominated twice for Oscars in the animated feature category - for Corpse Bride in 2006, and last year for Frankenweenie.

      <body>Indian singer Manna Dey has died in a Bangalore hospital at the age of 94. He had been ill for the past few months and was in hospital for a respiratory infection. His funeral is due to take place later on Thursday. Born Prabodh Chandra Dey in 1919, Dey was popularly known as Manna, and chalked up a number of hit Bollywood songs in a career spanning six decades. Tributes have been pouring in for the legendary singer from the government, the film industry and his fans. President Pranab Mukherjee and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh led the country in paying tributes to Dey. India "has lost a veteran playback singer, a versatile artist of extraordinary ability and a creative genius who mesmerised listeners with his enchanting voice," the president said. The prime minister described Dey as the "king of melody" and said with his death, the music world had lost one of its most talented artistes. "I am deeply saddened to hear of the demise of the King of Melody, Manna Dey. An accomplished singer with a unique voice, he was multi-talented and excelled in Rabindra Sangeet and various other forms of popular music," he said in his condolence message. "In his death, the music world has lost one of its most talented artistes. Dey's legacy will, however, live on through the many songs he sang," Mr Singh added. Dey sang in several languages including Hindi, Bengali, Assamese, Marathi, Kannada, Punjabi and Bhojpuri. His long career saw him win several awards for his contribution to music, including state honours like the Padma Shri in 1971 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2005. He was also given the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2007. Dey sang more than 3,500 songs, including romantic ballads, intricate raga-based songs, Qawwalis and fast-paced modern numbers in his career. Along with Mohammad Rafi, Mukesh, and Kishore Kumar, he made up what was known as the "famous quartet of singers" who dominated the Hindi film music industry from 1950s to 1970s. Many of Dey's tracks for Bollywood films became huge hits and he sang for some of the biggest Bollywood names like Raj Kapoor, Rajesh Khanna and Dharmendra. His most popular numbers included Zindagi kaisi hai paheli (Life, what a riddle it is) from the film Anand; Poocho na kaise maine raen bitayee (Don't ask how I spent my night) from Meri Surat Teri Aankhen; Ek chatur naar (A clever woman) from Padosan; and Eey bhai zara dekh ke chalo (Oh brother, look where you're going) from Meraa Naam Joker. He also sang for Bollywood super-hits Sholay and Amar Akbar Anthony. In the last few years, he had largely withdrawn from public life. Dey's peers from Bollywood and fans took to Twitter to pay tribute to the singer. "Today, great classical singer Manna Dey sahab, who we fondly called Manna da, is not among us anymore. He had a very pleasant and easy personality. He was very dedicated to his work. I salute him and pray that his soul rests in peace," singer Lata Mangeshkar, who collaborated on innumerable hits with him, wrote on Twitter. Mangeshkar's duet Pyar hua ikraar hua (I admit I'm in love), played as background to film of actors Raj Kapoor and Nargis on a rainy night under an umbrella in Shri 420, is among the most popular romantic songs of Bollywood. "Manna Dey, stalwart of the music world, passes away. Flooded with memories and his songs," tweeted Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan. In another tweet, Bachchan said: "Strange how we connect events of our life with his songs." "Manna Dey passes away. His voice shall linger forever. RIP," tweeted film-maker Mahesh Bhat. Actor Manoj Bajpai tweeted: "Manna Dey is no more! A great singer! Let's pray for him! My condolences to his family! His music will live for 1000 yrs. RIP." Actress Shabana Azmi wrote: "Manna Dey had a unique voice. He will live on through his songs Ai Meri Zohra Jabeen/ dil ka haal suney dilwala/ poocho na kaise maine. RIP." Popular cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle tweeted. "Oh no. Such terrible news to get up to. Manna Dey no more? Less melody in the world." Dey, a Bengali, also charmed neighbouring Bangladesh with songs in his mother tongue and in a message on Thursday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Dey would remain alive forever among music-loving people of the subcontinent. "People will never forget his extraordinary melodious voice and unique style," she said. </body>

      <body>Singer Noel Harrison has died at his home in Devon, aged 79. The son of the actor Rex Harrison, he was best known for recording the hit song The Windmills Of Your Mind on The Thomas Crown Affair soundtrack. It won best song at the 1968 Oscars and was later covered by artists including Dusty Springfield. Harrison spent much of his life in America, as an actor and performer, but moved back to the UK in the last decade or so to live in South Devon. He once said, of recording The Windmills Of Your Mind: "It didn't seem like a big deal at the time. I went to the studio one afternoon and sang it and pretty much forgot about it." Harrison continued: "I didn't realise until later what a timeless, beautiful piece Michel LeGrand and the Bergmans had written. It turned out to be my most notable piece of work." After moving to the US, he starred in the TV series The Girl from UNCLE and had chart hits with A Young Girl and Suzanne, by Leonard Cohen. On his website he wrote: "I was part of the 'British Invasion' spearheaded by The Beatles. I bought a nice house in Los Angeles. "There was another US charts record and four years of endless TV appearances, theatre tours and star-studded social occasions." However he revealed he "didn't like being a celebrity" and spent his sixties mixing performing with construction work before moving back to the UK, adding, "I was well out of the goldfish bowl and I liked it." Harrison was born in London on 29 January 1934, to Rex Harrison and his mother, Collette Thomas, the first of six Mrs Rex Harrisons. They later divorced and he lived in Bude, Cornwall, with his mother's parents before she took him to live in the Swiss Alps at 15. Harrison never went to school again but indulged his passion for ski-racing instead, becoming British champion in 1953. He was married three times and had children and grandchildren from his first two marriages. An admirer of Jacques Brel, Harrison created a one-man musical, Adieu, Jacques in the 1980s and, in 2002, released an album of songs from the show. Harrison played Glastonbury Festival's Spirit of '71 stage in 2011, marking 40 years since his first appearance at the festival. </body>

      <body>BBC Radio 1 presenter Nick Grimshaw has seen his audience figures slump by 300,000 over the last three months. The 29-year-old breakfast DJ now has one million fewer listeners than his predecessor Chris Moyles, according to the figures from research body Rajar. With 5.58m listeners a week, the breakfast show is suffering its lowest audience for a decade, easily beaten by the morning shows on Radios 2 and 4. Grimshaw took over from Moyles in 2012, in a bid to attract younger listeners. Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper said: "After the biggest set of changes to Radio 1 for a generation, we're really happy that the breakfast show sounds fresher, younger and more vibrant than ever and as a result 833,000 of the show's 'over-30s' listeners have moved on to other stations." Chris Evans appears to be the main beneficiary, attracting 9.34 million weekly listeners, while Radio 4's flagship Today show draws 6.8 million listeners. Evans' figures were up 800,000 on the same period last year, re-affirming his status as the UK's most popular breakfast DJ. Grimshaw, by comparison, has lost 305,000 listeners in the three months to 24 October - with audiences falling by 17% on the same quarter in 2012. He now trails Evans by 3.8 million listeners, a dramatic change from four years ago, when the breakfast shows for the two stations were almost neck and neck. Radio 1's breakfast show is now close to its record lowest audience of 5.5 million, recorded by Sara Cox in the last three months of her tenure, in 2003. Radio 2 continues to have the UK's biggest audience with 14.9 million listeners each week, up a million in a year. Radio 1 has 10.83 million listeners, marginally behind Radio 4's 10.87 million. "Radio 2 is a remarkable success story and continues to reach huge audiences whilst never failing to surprise and amaze with the diversity of its output," said Radio 2 controller Helen Boaden.

      <title>Bake Off final gets BBC Two record</title>
      <description>BBC Two scores its biggest audience in a decade as judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood crowned the winner of the fourth series of The Great British Bake Off.</description>

      <body>The Great British Bake Off is BBC Two's most-watched programme in a decade, after an average 8.4 million viewers saw Frances Quinn win series four. Clothes designer Quinn, 31, said she was "in complete and utter shock" after beating psychologist Kimberley Wilson and former model Ruby Tandoh. She impressed judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood with her wedding cake, inspired by A Midsummer Night's Dream. At its peak, some 9.1 million people tuned in to Tuesday night's finale. The episode - which also saw the amateur bakers making pretzels and picnic pie - secured double the audience tuning into the Uefa Champions League football match which was broadcast on ITV at the same time. The hit show, which moves to BBC One next series, beat the record held by a 2007 episode of Top Gear, by more than 400,000 viewers. Bake Off presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins had billed Quinn, who lives in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, as "the most creative baker to ever set foot in the tent". She said she was looking forward to celebrating with family and friends, after having to keep her win under wraps since recording the final episode during the summer. "I've been back at work and trying to keep a poker face," said Quinn. "I remember watching the Wimbledon final the following week and getting so emotional... and thinking at least Andy Murray doesn't have to hide his trophy under his bed for the next three months." Quinn said she was shocked to hear her name: "I don't think I could speak for a little while. It was so close, such a close final," she said. However she insisted there was no antagonism between the all-female finalists. "We all get on. People want to feel there was more competition than was the case," she said. "The emotions you go through in that tent - you never want to see anyone get that criticism. Outside the tent we're just supportive of each other." Hollywood called Quinn "a deserving winner", who beat the others "hands down" in the showstopper round. "She not only gave us the style, she gave us the substance too and that cake actually, each layer, superb," he said. Fellow judge Berry added: "She has attention to detail, she's got excellent flavours, her baking improved as each week went by. We're very proud of her." Quinn said she was not thinking of leaving her design job, although she has already been approached by agents and hopes to produce a book. "Work has been so, so supportive. I'm not going to say yay or nay to anything at the moment, I've got a mortgage to pay," she said. "The baking market is completely saturated so I don't want to do a book that's anything like one that's already out there. I'd like to create a book that's got all my rough sketches and ideas." "I don't know what the future is going to hold but it does excite me. What I'd love to do is combine both passions, baking and design." Meanwhile runner-up Tandoh, 21, has hit back at the "nastiness" the show and its contestants were subjected to, in a piece written for The Guardian. "Despite the saccharin sweetness of the Bake Off, an extraordinary amount of bitterness and bile has spewed forth every week from angry commentators, both on social media and in the press," she wrote. "Many took to Twitter decrying the demise of the show, voicing their hatred for certain bakers, and asserting (week after week!) that they would 'never watch it again' if X or Y got through that episode." The amateur baker - who recently received a first class honours degree in philosophy - said the criticism ranged from "gently cynical" to "downright obnoxious", and as the series went on she noticed "an increasing amount of personal vitriol and misogyny". Tandoh, who chef Raymond Blanc suggested was too thin to enjoy food, said she was "tired" of defending herself against the "boring, inevitable accusations of flirting with Paul Hollywood, of emotionally manipulating the judges and of somehow surfing into the final on a tidal wave of tears". She added: "So much of the criticism levelled at the bakers is gender-specific. My self-doubt has been simultaneously labelled pathetic, fake, attention-seeking and manipulative." </body>

      <body>The Metropolitan Police Service will be the subject of a BBC One documentary series that will go behind the scenes at Britain's largest police force. Channel controller Charlotte Moore said The Met would be the first "definitive" look at the "vital" organisation. Over six hour-long episodes, she said the public would see the police force "in a way never seen before". Met commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he was "delighted" to work with the BBC "on such an important project". "I hope that over the coming months, we can reveal the true scale and complexity of the challenges faced by officers and staff across the service." According to the BBC, the show will "take an in-depth look at how the Metropolitan Police Service works" and "show the scale and complexity of policing London on a day-to-day basis". "We have been granted extraordinary, unprecedented access to film from top to bottom of the organisation," said Moore, who nurtured the series in her previous role as commissioning editor for documentaries. The BBC One announcement coincides with news from BBC Three about five new factual and current affairs series. These include Slum Survivors, a three-part series that tests young people's resourcefulness in the slums of Lagos, Mumbai and Jakarta, and The Human Tissue Team, a two-part look at tissue donation. </body>

      <title>Liz West: An artist with extra Spice</title>
      <description>How a Spice Girls obsession helped an art career</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24655947</url>
      <date>1382660897</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70687000/jpg/_70687979_liz2.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Artist Liz West is gaining a glowing reputation for her colour-drenched light installations - but her art career might not have taken off if it were not for her world-record collection of Spice Girls memorabilia. Art and pop can go hand-in-hand, she explains. West is taking part in two exhibitions this week - one featuring her strips of coloured light radiating from the corner of an old warehouse, which is in the Synthesis exhibition as part of Manchester Science Festival. She has a growing reputation as a contemporary artist thanks to her arrangements of lights in precise, pleasing patterns and her collections of objects bathed in bright, bold hues. For the other exhibition, she has lent some of the 5,000 Spice Girls items she has amassed since the age of 11, including branded clothes, crisp packets and a clock, to an exhibition celebrating 40 years of Virgin Records in London. As well as being an artist, West holds the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of Spice Girls memorabilia. "The way I see it is that installation art is high culture and Spice Girls is pop culture," she says. "Although the two hold hands, they're separate." When looking to launch her art career, West's Spice Girls obsession came in useful when she found she could get paid for loaning her girl-powered pop collection to museums, film crews and events. "Because I was given that financial boost to start with, my art practice has been able to roll and roll," she says. "Now I'm able to fund my art practice through my art. I don't have to work in Starbucks part-time. A lot of artists do have to work part-time, and I think that would kill any creativity for me. It really would." West was born into the art world - almost literally - almost born on the floor of the Whitworth Gallery in Manchester, she says, when her mother Jenny was artist in residence there 28 years ago. A five-day-old West attended the opening of her mother's exhibition. When she was seven years old, West remembers putting nail varnish bottles on a bedroom shelf in line according to their colour. It is not difficult to spot a link between her love of colour as a child and the artworks she now creates. Then when she was 11, the Spice Girls arrived. "A very impressionable age, I think," she says. "I was hooked. The colour, the energy, the different personalities. That appealed - more so probably than the music." When the Spice Girls' second album came out in 1997, West decided to collect any and every recording and item of memorabilia she could get her hands on. "I'd go to the pound shop and buy bags of things as a 13- or 14-year-old. They brought out the dolls and I went to London to the Hamleys sale. "Of course, when eBay appeared when I was 18, I had a student loan, went a bit mad, and it just continued." Influenced by her parents (her father Steve is also an artist), West attended the prestigious Glasgow School of Art. "When I was a student, I'd go into the studio all day and then I'd go into the library in the evening and just bid and bid and bid [on eBay]," she says. "I'd have a day of art and an evening of Spice." West says she has spent "tens of thousands" of pounds on her collection, which also includes outfits from the Brit Awards, the Spiceworld movie and the jacket Mel B wore to meet Nelson Mandela. But it does not include the most iconic Spice outfit of them all - Geri Halliwell's union jack dress from the 1997 Brit Awards. That was bought by the Hard Rock Cafe in Las Vegas for £41,000. "That's the holy grail," West says. "And it's in storage. That's quite upsetting." Now, West's art career is taking off thanks to her luminous installations that look like she has dismantled and rearranged a rainbow. "Did you see the rainbow the other day over Manchester?" she says excitedly at the mention of rainbows. "This was a double one and it was a proper arch. I stopped in the street for about five minutes and stared at it. "I thought, forget James Turrell and Olafur Eliasson and all the artists that I absolutely love - this is true absolute beauty. There's something in that that I could never create, even if I tried." West says she is not worried about her Spice Girls obsession undermining her reputation as an artist. "It's completely in keeping with my personality," she says. "And because I've got such a passion for it, I win people over with that passion. It's not just about T-shirts and dollies. "As a serious artist, this is my career. I want to be nominated for the Turner Prize. "If you look at other artists, there are quite a few that have quirky collections out there and haven't hidden them. I don't have a problem with it." What do other artists say when they find out about the collection? "They think it's quite funny," West replies. "You know, it would be really boring if I didn't do anything else. People tend to think that it's a quirk, and quite a nice one." </body>

      <title>Corden on singing like Paul Potts</title>
      <description>James Corden on becoming Paul Potts</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24565984</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70690000/jpg/_70690011_cordenfilmshot.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>James Corden talks about bringing Britain's Got Talent winner Paul Potts to the big screen, singing with Keira Knightley and his admiration for Meryl Streep. Corden admits he had his doubts about playing talent show contestant-turned-opera singer Potts in his new film One Chance. "I think my reaction was the same as everyone else's when they hear there's a Paul Potts film," laughs Corden. "I was like 'Really? Are you sure this is a good idea?" But after director David Frankel, of The Devil Wears Prada fame, convinced him the film would focus on the build-up to that famous audition - Potts' journey from a bullied, opera-obsessed young boy to a YouTube sensation - he was in. "It's a sports movie basically, where the sport is... opera," says Corden. Potts was a mobile-phone salesman when he entered and won the first series of reality show Britain's Got Talent in 2007, and the film uses footage of judges Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden and Piers Morgan's genuine reactions to that "watercooler moment". It also boasts British talent such as Julie Walters and Colm Meaney as Paul's parents, MacKenzie Crook as his friend (and manager in Carphone Warehouse) and Alexandra Roach as his love interest. Corden had to practise wearing his clip-in fake "Paul Potts teeth" for six weeks to conquer any lisping - Potts famously got his fixed with his BGT prize money - but they were "tremendously useful" for getting into character. Pulling off Potts' operatic singing voice proved a bit more challenging. "When I said yes to the film I was a little bit bullish and thought, 'I can do this'," reveals Corden. "So they got me some singing lessons with this brilliant teacher in New York. After about eight or nine lessons some producers came down to hear my opera. "I got about a third of the way through Nessun Dorma and they just went, 'Yeah we're going to get someone else to do this'. It wasn't great." So Corden sang "with the micrrophone turned off" during filming, "and then Paul sort of synched to my lips really". "We were all a little bit worried - will it work, will they buy it?" admits Corden. "Actually you kind of do." The film is backed by Hollywood heavyweight producer Harvey Weinstein, who Corden is said to have impressed while on stage in last year's hit play One Man, Two Guvnors. But he's quick to rubbish internet rumours that Weinstein will be running any sort of Oscar campaign for him. "For this?" he laughs. "I would be very surprised, I can't imagine that will be anywhere close to the case. "We've made a really nice, light, humorous film and I'm immensely proud of it, but I think you can start to get ever so slightly carried away with those sorts of things and I'm definitely not, in any way." It must be hard for Corden to keep his feet on the ground though, when he is currently turning up to work at Shepperton Studios with the likes of Johnny Depp and Meryl Streep. Nine director Rob Marshall has cast him in "a dream of a role", as The Baker in a big-budget film version of Broadway musical Into the Woods. "It's certainly the biggest thing I've ever done. It's ridiculous, I spent a long time just waiting to be fired really," says Corden. "I thought someone would go, 'This is silly, we should get someone who's actually famous'." But he's still in the job, along with Chris Pine, Anna Kendrick and Emily Blunt. However it is Streep who has really impressed him. "I would be a robot if it didn't affect me, I think she's probably the greatest actress alive," he says enthusiastically. "But (the reason) she's so incredible, is that she's just so unbelievably welcoming and encouraging and puts you at ease. (She is) a team player, she encourages a company spirit. I genuinely can't speak highly enough about her." Having misspent some of his youth in various, slightly dubious boybands, Corden can actually hold a tune. He'll be doing so in Into the Woods and alongside Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo in another film, Can a Song Save Your Life?, due out next year. "I play Keira's old friend from home who's a struggling musician in New York. I sing, but I'm not - there's a pattern emerging here - I sing but I'm not very good," he laughs. "Keira's really got the best songs in it - her voice is unbelievable, genuinely. People are going to be so shocked when they hear it. I think it's her best performance. "It's written and directed by John Carney who made the film Once, which I'm a huge fan of. I'm very proud to be in it," says Corden. In fact, these days Corden seems rightly proud of all his work. With flops like Lesbian Vampire Killers and his ill-fated sketch show Horne and Corden better left out of it, he currently has his fingers in many successful pies. New BBC Two comedy The Wrong Mans is a return to form for the Gavin and Stacey co-creator - currently enjoying positive viewing figures and favourable reviews. And co-written with Mathew Baynton, it gives him the chance to do what he likes best: "Being at the seed of an idea, and writing it and shooting it and editing it seeing it through. That is probably where I'm probably most creatively fulfilled." There's also hosting Sky One sports quiz A League of Their Own, and another year of the Brit Awards in 2014 before he hands hosting duties over to "someone younger and better looking". His plans to return to the stage - "I think in 2015" - sound like they've been mapped out with precision, but Corden denies that is the case. "I've never really had a career plan, which I'm sure won't come as a shock to anyone," he says. "Mainly my plan is to have fun and enjoy it. I couldn't think of anything worse than not enjoying it really." </body>

      <title>Waiting for the world to end</title>
      <description>Artist Colin Hambrook on grief, psychosis and Armageddon</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-ouch-24642553</url>

      <body>Colin Hambrook is a poet and visual artist with mental health difficulties and ME. He runs Disability Arts Online (DAO) a web portal for disabled artists which reviews and showcases their work. In Hambrook's latest autobiographical project, Knitting Time, he recalls being brought up by a Jehovah's Witness mother who was mentally ill. She, Hambrook and the other Jehovah's Witnesses they knew, believed that the world was due to end in 1975. This collection of illustrated poetry, and the accompanying art exhibition, explore the psychosis and grief he experienced as a result. Why did you call it Knitting Time? Knitting time is an allegory for psychosis. What that does to you is bring you to a place where time is distended. Brain functions, like memory and cognition, can get distorted and it becomes very difficult to believe what's going on in your head. The idea of Knitting Time was to try and encapsulate that sense of bringing yourself back into reality. What's it about? The story that unfolds through the poetry and artwork is that of my mother. She was sectioned in the late 60s, early 70s and knitting was one of the key activities that "mental patients" were given to keep their hands busy. Once they had finished, the knitting was ripped apart and the wool re-used. My mother's psychosis got worse as time went on and knitting became a key part of her world. She was knitting new universes, places of safety we could go to when the world ended. What was it like to believe that the world would end before you'd reached adulthood? I was a very serious little boy and took the Jehovah's Witnesses seriously. It was frightening to be brought up in this belief and to realise I had to do my best to be perfect, so that I'd be among the chosen ones when the end came. Everything went wrong quite a few years before 1975 though. When my mother was sectioned, we were thrown out of the faith. We were led to believe that only families who had a strong patriarch at their helm were eligible to be chosen but dad refused to have anything to do with the Jehovah's Witnesses, So we felt we were damned anyway. You were 16 in 1975. Did you still believe the end was imminent? By 1975, I had largely come to realise that it was all rubbish. All about money, power and religious oppression. But there was still a part of me that was keyed in to those beliefs. How did you feel when the end never came? My feelings were mixed. What had happened to my mother in the mental health system left me very depressed, so a big part of me was looking forward to it all ending. I didn't move forward easily. I became very lost and pretty mentally ill and stayed in that state for most of my twenties. There's part of me that's never quite come to terms with the fact that the world didn't end in 1975. Knitting Time's main theme is psychosis. What's your personal experience of this? I don't think psychosis is necessarily a bad thing. It's common for toddlers to have imaginary friends and night visions, to see things that aren't there. I had that facility to a greater degree than most. I remember vividly seeing things at night time like a lion treading up the stairs or a man dressed in an archetypal burglar outfit, swag-bag on back. Did your psychotic episodes change when you became an adult? This capacity for hallucination has come and gone throughout my life. A large part of me realised early on that it was my mind playing tricks. If I haven't slept and my nervous system is distended, it is likely that the psychotic episode will be unpleasant. But if I can relax into it and find space to let it be, then it can be interesting. When I was nine or 10, an angel exuding white light stayed with me all night. That was very beautiful. What was your motivation for producing work about psychosis? People's prejudice around psychosis is down to a fear of those kinds of experiences, because people don't understand it and people don't talk about it. One of my main motivations for doing this project was to try and have a conversation about something people see as very dark and very difficult. The other big theme of Knitting Time is grief. Why? After my mum had electric shock therapy, she temporarily lost all memory of her children. It was like she'd died, the person we knew before never came back. During my pre-teen and teenage years, I went through a process of mourning. A lot of my psychosis was in response to the grief I felt. I read a book by Joan Didion about the years following her husband's death, when she went through a psychosis related to her grief. It brought home to me my own experiences as a child. The poetry I wrote for Knitting Time is a reflection on that part of my life and how, like Joan, I came through it with the help of family and friends. Knitting time is published by Waterloo Press. The art exhibition which accompanies the book is at the Pallant House Gallery until 3 November.

      <title>John Carpenter reflects on Halloween</title>
      <description>John Carpenter reflects on hit horror Halloween as it turns 35</description>

      <body>In 1978, a low-budget film about a masked killer stalking a young babysitter in a quiet Illinois suburb took the film industry by storm. Filmed for just over $300,000 (about $1m today), John Carpenter's Halloween has since made more than $47m. Cinema audiences were terrified and delighted in equal amount and Michael Myers, with his battered white facemask became a pop culture icon, preceding the likes of Jason Voorhees, the hockey-masked brute from the Friday the 13th films and Freddie Krueger of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. "I can believe it," says the now 65-year-old semi-retired director, about the span of time since he created one of the ultimate movie monsters. "I'm old now, 35 years ago I was a young kid then just trying to make a movie but some part of me still feels like that young kid." Prior to Halloween, Carpenter had already known some success with the exploitation film Assault on Precinct 13 which, although a flop in the US, had enjoyed some resurgence in Europe after being screened at the London Film Festival in 1977. He was called to a meeting in London with producer Irwin Yablans and Syrian financier Moustapha Akkad who wanted a film which, Carpenter says, "was originally to be called The Babysitter Murders". "The idea was that every American girl can relate to that." After persuading Akkad to part with the money and cede full creative control to Carpenter and his writing partner Debra Hill, work began on the script for Halloween. Carpenter even composed the music for the film, its tinkling piano and doom-laden chords powering it on to become one of horror's most recognisable and enduring film themes. "The biggest memory I have in a way was how easy it was," says the director. "I had a few features under my belt so I was really rolling in terms of the physical problems of shooting a movie, just how to get through it. And I had the movie figured out and it was a lot of fun." Although the idea of a stalking killer was not a new one, having been seen in films like Michael Powell's voyeuristic Peeping Tom; Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola's Dementia 13 and even Tobe Hooper's creation Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween's Myers was a different beast. "We had this idea of Michael Myers being not quite a human but almost a supernatural force," says Carpenter. "Evil as a force of nature in the personification of this man. "So we put him in a mask so he wouldn't have human features." The two-dollar rubber mask was a likeness of Star Trek actor William Shatner, sprayed a bluish-white - and it terrified people. "The best compliment I got was standing outside a theatre and hearing the audience scream, that was just delightful." Halloween ushered in the era of the slasher movies of the 1980s. Though they were not the first, it - along with Friday 13th - brought the previously niche horror genre hurtling into the mainstream. Carpenter, however, plays down his reputation as the father of the genre: "I think the main reason that Halloween inspired other movies was very shrewd producers looking and saying, 'This idiot made this for $300,000, we can do it and make money'. "It's all about making money in Hollywood. It wasn't about art." The slasher genre now looks relatively timid when compared with the explosion in what became known as the "torture porn" of the 2000s. Super-violent films such as Hostel and the Saw franchise undoubtedly built on the brutal nature of films like Halloween and Friday the 13th. Since then, filmmakers have returned to the basics with ghost films like The Conjuring and The Woman In Black, which have proved to be a massive draw at the box office. But Carpenter - who has dabbled in ghostly tales such as The Fog and Christine - again insists: "Horror films have been around since the beginning of cinema and each one leads to another so they continue to morph and change depending on society. "None of this is new, there have always been ghost stories. There are just new ways of telling stories." Though horror makes up the main body of Carpenter's work, the director has branched out into other genres such as the comedy-action of Big Trouble in Little China and the romance of Starman - which earned Jeff Bridges an Oscar nomination. His influence on a younger generation of filmmakers can been seen, in particular in the work of Danish director Nicholas Winding Refn of Drive fame. In a recent BBC interview, he voiced his love for Carpenter's 1981 film Escape from New York - starring Kurt Russell as the anti-hero Cyclops Snake Plissken whose mission is to rescue the US president from the Big Apple - now a maximum security prison. "God, I loved that movie," said Refn. "It's perfect cinema, a perfect soundtrack. That pulsey beat." Carpenter, roaring with laughter, is clearly delighted with the compliment: "Hell yes," he cackles. "Who wouldn't be?" If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then Carpenter is blessed indeed, for alongside the seven sequels to Halloween, no fewer than four of his films have been remade in recent years, with an adaptation of Escape from New York long rumoured. British actors Jason Statham and Tom Hardy are believed to be front-runners to take over the role of Plissken. "I'm mostly extremely excited, especially when they have to pay me money," says Carpenter. "I made my films and the remakes are the remakes, so its fine with me." After 43 years in the film business, Carpenter is now semi-retired but offers a word of advice to young filmmakers. "The biggest challenge is surviving the movie business and making films despite all the obstacles in your way," he says. "Nobody tells you how to survive. "I don't know if I'm as hungry as I was. I'm not as driven as I was, my entire life's goal was to become a professional director and I did that, I've nothing left to prove to myself." A 35th anniversary edition of Halloween is out on 21 October. </body>

      <title>Tinie Tempah: 'I believe in the magic of music'</title>
      <description>Tinie Tempah on celebrity, success and self-awareness</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24582845</url>

      <body>Brit Award-winning UK rapper Tinie Tempah tells how Adele helped him pick the songs for his new album - and why his old school might not like it. Tinie Tempah has no eyes on the cover of his new album. They've been scratched out, painted over. And deliberately so. "I'm trying to make it about the music again," he explains. "It felt like I was starting to become a personality. People were starting to know me for lots of other things, which is cool, but I just want it to be about the music. "Don't look at the eyes, listen to the voice, hear what I'm saying." Coming to terms with fame is a recurring theme of the star's second album, called Demonstration. "Tell me, doctor, am I fit for all these flashing lights?" he asks on Children of The Sun. On Looking Down The Barrel, the rapper admits: "When I'm near the public for too long, I act fidgety." "You can definitely hear me battling to hold onto that sense of normality and reality, as opposed to being thrown into this mad world of celebrity," says the 24-year-old. The success of his Mercury-nominated debut made Tinie a tabloid fixture - linked with Rihanna and Nicole Scherzinger in the gossip columns. But thankfully his new album isn't an awful "tears of a pop star" sobfest about empty hotel rooms and emptier relationships. Instead, he lists his distractions - New York fashion week, partying in Las Vegas - before admonishing himself: "Oy oy, mate, don't sell out!" "The most important thing is self-awareness," he says - but witty lyrics help, too. He writes, on the Daft Punk-referencing Lover Not A Fighter - about meeting his old teacher, who declares herself a fan and tries (successfully) "to get in my jeans". Is it a true story? "It's not directly literal," he laughs. "Without sounding un-gentlemanly, it may not necessarily have been 'my teacher', but it could have been 'a teacher.'" Nonetheless, he's keen to find out how the song is received in his old school staff room. "It's going to be like a game of Cluedo! They're going to be looking around - 'was it you?'" Born Patrick Chukwuemeka Okogwu, Tinie Tempah grew up in the notorious, now-condemned Aylesbury estate in Peckham. His parents had come to the UK from Nigeria in their 20s. His father, a barber, retrained as a social worker and his mother worked as a human resources officer. By the time Tinie was 12, they had saved enough money to move to Plumstead - a short walk from the O2 Arena, which he headlines in December. The youngster picked up his parents' work ethic, gaining A-Levels in media studies, religious studies and psychology. But his life changed when he saw the music video for So Solid Crew's 21 Seconds: Rap, he suddenly realised, didn't have to come from the other side of the Atlantic. He took a job selling double-glazing to fund his first music video, and was being played on radio stations like KISS and BBC Radio 1Xtra before he signed a record deal with Parlophone in 2009. Five of the singles from his first album, Disc-Overy, hit the UK top 20 - while the inspirational, rap-rock crossover Written In The Stars made him a star in America, too. But the follow-up was delayed while his record label Parlophone changed hands, as part of the huge Universal-EMI merger. "There was a holding period where I could release the album in England, but I wouldn't have been able to release it in the rest of the world," says the musician. "It was a mad, compromising time. I remember Coldplay had just brought out their album and Chris Martin said to me, 'everyone who got out their album at the start of the year was lucky because there's going to have to be a long wait.'" Tinie filled the time writing new songs, and releasing others for free online. "I've realised more and more you need to get your ideas out," he says. "Unless you know you've made another Heal The World, I don't think you should hold on to music. "If you empty your tank it'll refill again." Forever attired in a tailored jacket, dark blue denim and his trademark, thick-rimmed spectacles, Tinie was named Britain's best-dressed man by GQ Magazine two years ago. He told the editors he maintained a sharp appearance because "it would be weird if I was wearing exactly what someone in the crowd was wearing. What would set me aside from them?" But off-stage, he is determined to stay grounded. His cousin is his manager, he's constantly in touch with his mum, and everyone has the right to put him in his place. "I don't consider myself a crazy person, so if I do get a good telling-off, I usually know it's for something worthwhile," he says. He's coy about his transgressions, though - admitting only that he gets carried away in clothes shops. "People will say, 'you're never going to wear that, you're getting excited,'" he laughs. "I'm not off the rails... yet, anyway." However, he can't help referencing his new-found wealth on his record. Lines like "I'm putting on the pounds but I ain't gaining weight" permeate the new album - but does he worry that bragging about success will alienate fans? "I definitely do think that," he says, "but all these things are happening to me and you can't not say it. "You know when you've put a lot of water in a balloon, and it's getting bigger and bigger? Sometimes I just want to burst with excitement - and where else should I say that, if not in my music?" He hopes the lyrics give fans something to aspire to - the same way So Solid Crew inspired him. "I always feel an obligation to anybody who's trying to be like me," he says. "I'm a British musician and I'm very much in pop culture - but I have come from grime, a genre of music which is still very niche, and is still very underground." "Given where I've come from, there's an obligation to say, 'you know what? The world is a big place, and the moment I left here and applied myself, great things happened.'" He certainly moves in high circles. He got feedback on the new album from Coldplay's Chris Martin, while Adele advised him on the track list. He's also been picking up tips in Hollywood. "I was lucky enough to go to Jennifer Lopez's house [and] she basically said to me that anybody at the top of their game is constantly still studying their craft. "She gave me an example of the fact that Will Smith, whenever he shoots a movie, still has his acting coach on the other side of the camera. "Even though he's at the top of his game, he still wants to learn. It's such a humbling thing for me, you know, so that was a really good bit of advice." Unsurprisingly, his ambitions are global: Hearing Beyonce sing Irreplaceable in Spanish (Irreempazable) made him realise that success wasn't just determined by breaking America. "Playing in Kuala Lumpur or Sri Lanka is just as good a feeling as playing in America," he says. "It's just about being as big an artist as I can be. "I believe in the magic of music. Hopefully one day I'll make the right song, or the right album, that will impact the whole world." Tinie Tempah releases the single Children of the Sun on Monday, 28 October. His album, Demonstration follows on 4 November. </body>

      <title>UK growth fastest for three years</title>
      <description>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show, the fastest growth since 2010.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24668687</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70705000/jpg/_70705133__52287135_000006818-1-1.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show. The Office for National Statistics said there had been a "fairly strong" performance across all sectors. The data builds on a 0.7% GDP rise in the April-June period and is the best quarterly performance since 2010. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne tweeted: "This shows that Britain's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity." Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the figures "show that we are firmly on the road to economic recovery". The ONS data for construction was up 2.5% over the quarter, the second successive quarter of growth after a volatile performance over the past year. The BBC's chief economics correspondent, Hugh Pym, said: "This could signal that a recovery in that sector is really under way." House-builders have been buoyed by the Government's Help to Buy scheme, which recently launched a new phase offering mortgage guarantees. The ONS said that production grew by 0.5%, though this remains 12.8% off its 2008 level, while within this, manufacturing improved 0.9% in the third quarter. The services sector, which represents three-quarters of economic output, grew by 0.7%. Output from services is now above its pre-crisis peak in the first quarter of 2008. Friday's figure is the first estimate, and could be revised up or down in subsequent months. Mr Osborne told the BBC: "It shows that we are on the path to prosperity. Lots of risks remain, so we have to stick with the economic plan that has got us this far. "What's encouraging about these figures is that it's not just services that are growing. Construction is growing and manufacturing is growing." Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: "After three damaging years of flatlining, it's both welcome and long overdue that our economy is growing again. "But for millions of people across the country still seeing prices rising faster than their wages, this is no recovery at all." Despite the further evidence that recovery is gaining hold, some economists remain cautious. The Institute of Directors' chief economist Graeme Leach said: "The outlook looks better than at any time since the onset of the financial crisis. Indeed, our members have more confidence in the economy than at any time since 2008. "However, strong headwinds remain and the annual growth rate year on year is nothing to get too excited about yet. Though inflationary pressures are likely to remain benign, debt and inflation are rising faster than earnings. "By far the biggest challenges remain on the supply side, not the demand side. Supply side constraints mean that the current growth spurt is unlikely to extend beyond next year. "This stage of our economic recovery is likely to be short and sweet, instead of long and strong." The director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, John Longworth, said: "This is the highest quarterly increase we've seen in three years, so the economy is clearly moving in the right direction. "But we are still behind a number of advanced economies, such as the US and Germany, that have managed to recover the output lost during the economic downturn. "Much more needs to be done to transform our economy from being good to being really great." Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said the figures confirmed the UK was enjoying "a period of healthy and well-balanced growth". He said it was likely that the UK recorded the fastest quarterly growth rate within the G7 countries in the third quarter. But he added that a squeeze on real incomes as wage growth lagged behind inflation, together with the fiscal squeeze and a stagnant eurozone, were likely to prevent recovery gathering much more pace. It echoed remarks by Bank of England governor Mark Carney on Thursday evening, when he said in a speech that the rate of growth was "towards the top end of the advanced economies", but "coming from a very very low base". </body>

      <title>Grangemouth plant to stay open</title>
      <description>The Grangemouth petrochemical plant near Falkirk is to stay open after a new deal was struck with workers.</description>

      <body>The Grangemouth petrochemical plant near Falkirk is to stay open after a new deal was struck with workers. Staff were told in a mass meeting at 11:00 that the decision to close the site would be reversed. Operator Ineos announced on Wednesday that the plant was to shut, with the loss of 800 jobs, after union members rejected a survival plan. But on Friday, Ineos said it would reopen the plant and the neighbouring oil refinery "with immediate effect". The news was welcomed by the Unite union and political leaders. The company said the move had followed a "dramatic U-turn" by Unite and its "belated recognition" that the company's survival plan was the only way to ensure Grangemouth's long-term future. It added that Unite had agreed to taking no strike action for three years, moving to a "modern" pension scheme and accepting a three-year pay freeze. Ineos also confirmed it would invest a further £300m in the site's long-term future. The company's announcement was greeted by huge cheers from the workforce, who had gathered at the plant to be told of the company's decision. Unite Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said: "Relief will ring right round the Grangemouth community, and across Scotland today. "Hundreds of jobs that would have been lost can now be saved and £300m will be invested into the plant." First Minister Alex Salmond described the announcement as a "tremendous fillip for the workforce and the whole Grangemouth community, following what could have been a potential disaster". He said it had been "a great team effort from all concerned", including the unions and workforce, the management and governments. "I am delighted that people have rallied round to protect these jobs, and now we can all agree that Grangemouth has an outstanding future," he added. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael also welcomed the announcement, saying that it was "the news that we all wanted". "The staff and their families have been through a very stressful and uncertain time," he said. "They have been through a hell of a week and I hope they have a much better weekend as a result of today's announcement." Mr Carmichael added: "They can look to the future with an optimism which was absent earlier in the week." Ineos' future plans include investing a further £300m in the site. Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean said: "It is a huge investment and that investment was only rightly to be done if we had a long-term sustainable base. "What we have now done is given the chemicals business another 15 to 20 years on the back of new raw materials, new contracts and significant investment." Mr MacLean would not dismiss the prospect of redundancies, but said they would be "very limited". He also denied that the company had demanded any additional concessions from the union. The company said the Scottish government had indicated it would support its application for a £9m grant to help finance a gas terminal, while the UK government had given "pre-qualification approval" for a £125m loan guarantee facility. Ineos founder and chairman Jim Ratcliffe said it was "a victory for common sense". He told the BBC that the Grangemouth complex "should have a life for many years to come, as long as we can get this gas terminal built and we can sign up gas contracts and bring gas in from America". The company has indicated that 2,000 contractors it laid off after shutting down the complex would be re-hired to support investment in its survival plan. Falkirk Council, which had planned to set up a task force to respond to the threatened closure, said the Ineos announcement was "the best possible outcome for all concerned". Council leader Craig Martin added: "There has been a tremendous effort behind the scenes to secure the plant's future involving UK and Scottish governments and Falkirk Council, working together to ensure the plant's survival. "This partnership approach has paid off and a more stable and positive future for the workforce has been delivered." The closure move came after workers rejected a deal which would have changed their pay and pensions. Ministers and Unite were involved in top-level talks on Thursday to try to save the site and a fresh offer was made by unions to the company. </body>

      <title>Barroso backs Cameron over red tape</title>

      <body>David Cameron has won the backing of EU chief Jose Manuel Barroso for his push to limit the number of new regulations coming out of Brussels. The two chaired a meeting of EU leaders on the issue at Friday's summit. The prime minister has said firms are being "throttled" by red tape and for every regulation and directive introduced another should be removed. Mr Barroso said more needed to be done to ensure "lighter, simpler, cheaper, common-sense regulation". The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, has said it has already cut 5,590 regulations since 2005. Mr Cameron is committed to renegotiating the UK's relationship with the EU if the Conservative Party wins the next election, ahead of an "in-out" referendum on whether the country should remain a member. In the meantime, he is promising to work to reduce the bureaucracy facing companies. Conservative sources say he wants to see 1,500 regulations reviewed. Eighty business leaders, including the chairmen of BT and Asda, have signed a letter calling for a "strong commitment" by the government towards this and several have accompanied Mr Cameron to Brussels to make the case. The prime minister has made the issue the central objective of the two-day European Council meeting. He held one-to-one meetings with the leaders of Germany and the Netherlands, who share similar views on deregulation, and co-chaired a meeting with the leaders of Poland, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy and Estonia, who are also sympathetic. "The Commission has done an excellent job in lifting the burden of bureaucracy. Now I want to get business engaged," he said, adding that a faster pace of deregulation was essential to getting firms to "compete and succeed". Mr Barroso, the Commission's president, said he appreciated that businesses needed a single set of rules, rather than 28 different bodies of national regulation, for the single market to work and for the important digital economy to continue to grow. Acknowledging that "useless laws weaken necessary laws", he said there were other areas where it was necessary to cut bureaucracy without reducing standards of consumer protection, health and safety and environmental concerns. "That is why we have to slash red tape," he said. </body>

      <description>EU leaders meeting in Brussels say distrust of the US over spying could harm intelligence-gathering in the fight against terrorism.</description>

      <body>EU leaders meeting in Brussels say distrust of the US over spying could harm the fight against terrorism. A statement agreed by the leaders says that "a lack of trust could prejudice" intelligence-gathering co-operation. France and Germany are pushing for talks with the US to find a new "understanding" by the year's end. A number of allegations against US intelligence agents have surfaced this week, including the bugging of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone. In addition there have been claims that the US National Security Agency (NSA) monitored millions of French telephone calls. On Thursday, the UK's Guardian newspaper also reported that it had obtained a confidential memo from the NSA suggesting it had monitored the phones of 35 world leaders. The latest revelations have been sourced to US whistleblower Edward Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who fled the country earlier this year and is now in Russia. They have overshadowed other issues at the EU summit in Brussels, including the Mediterranean migration problem, which frames the agenda of Friday's talks. Italian authorities said they had intercepted some 800 migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean as the EU leaders prepared to meet. The statement of heads of state or government, released on Friday, reflects the EU leaders' conclusions following their talks on Thursday. It says the recent intelligence issues had raised "deep concerns" among European citizens. The statement says the leaders "underlined the close relationship between Europe and the USA and the value of that partnership". It continues: "[The leaders] stressed that intelligence-gathering is a vital element in the fight against terrorism." And it went on: "A lack of trust could prejudice the necessary cooperation in the field of intelligence-gathering." Belgian Prime Minister Elio di Rupo said: "The objective must remain the same - to fight against terrorism but also respect privacy. "Everyone can understand the need for exceptional measures given the danger of terrorism... but we are not in the position where we should spy on each other." Talks among the EU leaders had continued late into Thursday night. Speaking afterwards, Mrs Merkel said: "We need trust among allies and partners. Such trust now has to be built anew. "The United States of America and Europe face common challenges. We are allies. But such an alliance can only be built on trust. That's why I repeat again: spying among friends, that cannot be." Germany and France said they were proposing talks with the US to settle the row by the end of the year. The leaders' statement said: "The heads of state or government took note of the intention of France and Germany to seek bilateral talks with the USA with the aim of finding before the end of the year an understanding on mutual relations in that field. "They noted that other EU countries are welcome to join this initiative." French President Francois Hollande said on Friday; "What is at stake is preserving our relations with the United States." BBC Europe editor Gavin Hewitt says the French and Germans are looking for a new set of rules with a "no spying pact" at the core. He says this would mirror an arrangement the United States has had with Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada since just after World War II. That secret intelligence-sharing operation is known as Five Eyes. EU President Herman Van Rompuy accepted the UK had "a special relationship" with the US, but said Britain was "completely on board with this text". UK PM David Cameron has yet to comment. But a number of other leaders have indicated their support for the French and German position. Finnish PM Jyrki Katainen said: "We have to talk together with the Americans, and try to find some sort of code of conduct [on] how to cooperate on this kind of issue in the future." Swedish PM Fredrik Reinfeldt said it was "completely unacceptable" to eavesdrop on the leader of an ally, a view echoed by Italian PM Enrico Letta, who added: "We want the truth." But the BBC's Chris Morris in Brussels says that, despite the widespread anger about American spying, Mrs Merkel opposed a suggestion to suspend trade talks with the United States - and on that point, the UK will be relieved. Other leaders signalled the need to move on. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said: "The main thing is that we look to the future. The trans-Atlantic partnership was, and is, important." Mrs Merkel had raised her concerns with US President Barack Obama in a call on Wednesday. White House spokesman Jay Carney later said Mr Obama had assured Mrs Merkel that her phone was not being listened to now and would not be in the future. However, his statement left open the question of whether calls had been listened to in the past. </body>

      <title>Serco chief executive stands down</title>
      <description>The boss of security firm Serco resigns after accusations of overcharging the government tens of millions of pounds for electronic tags for criminals.</description>

      <body>The chief executive at Serco, a security firm at the centre of an overcharging scandal, has resigned. Outgoing boss Chris Hyman said the best way for the company to move forward "is for me to step back". Serco is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) after claims it had overcharged the government by "tens of millions" of pounds for electronic tags for criminals. The government welcomed the news, describing it as a "positive move". In July, Justice Secretary Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said an audit had revealed a "significant anomaly in the billing practices" of both Serco and G4S. Mr Grayling said that since 2005, the companies had in some cases been charging for tagging offenders who were in prison, had left the country or were even dead. In September, the government handed information to the SFO for their assessment. On Friday, Serco announced plans to reorganise the company. The firm said it would split the government work into a separate business that could be more closely monitored. A government statement said it would "take full account of all the changes Serco have made today". "Whilst it is early days in their programme of renewal, this is a positive move by Serco and a step forward." The statement added that its review of government contracts, announced in July by the Justice Secretary, was continuing and would "ensure government's contractual arrangements are robust and taxpayers' money is spent responsibly, in a vibrant, competitive market for public services". Shares in Serco were up 2.8% after the news. Mr Hyman said he had "always put the interests of Serco first", adding that it was important the relationship with the government was rebuilt. He said: "I have been fortunate enough to have had the privilege of working at a great company with extremely talented people. I wish everyone at Serco the very best for the future." No new contracts are being awarded to either of the firms until the audit is completed, the government said in September. The head of G4S, Richard Morris, stepped down on Thursday. </body>

      <description>Campaigners write to David Cameron demanding action on the "national crisis" of cold homes, as people are advised to keep houses well heated.</description>

      <body>Fuel poverty campaigners have written to Prime Minister David Cameron demanding cross-party action on the "national crisis" of cold homes. Campaigners said the UK was second only to Estonia for people struggling to pay their energy bills across Europe. It came as Public Health England urged people to keep their homes well heated this winter to avoid potentially fatal health problems. It said living rooms should be 21C (70F) and other home areas 18C (65F). Campaign group Energy Bill Revolution - an alliance of charities including Age UK and Barnardos - said the biggest problem in the UK was "leaky homes" and called for investment in a domestic insulation programme. Energy Bill Revolution said "woeful" levels of insulation had left Britain falling way behind comparable European countries such as Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands. Campaign director Ed Matthew said: "Our political leaders are falling over themselves to come up with headline-grabbing ways to cut energy bills yet they fall woefully short of a true solution to the energy bill crisis. "By far the biggest opportunity to cut energy bills is to fully insulate the UK's leaky homes. No other investment can do so much for so many. If the government is serious about solving this crisis they must make insulating homes the UK's number one infrastructure priority." Public Health England's advice came in its Cold Weather Plan for 2013, after four of the big six energy companies announced price rises. Age UK said older people in particular were increasingly anxious about the cost of heating their homes. Winter health risks range from flu to falls - but the cold can also make heart and respiratory problems much worse. On average there are about 24,000 excess winter deaths in England each year, many of which experts say are preventable. The plan has been produced in collaboration with the Department of Health, NHS England and the Local Government Association. It contains advice for the NHS and local government, as well as individuals. This includes having your flu vaccination if you are in an at-risk group, ensuring homes are properly insulated and making sure heating systems are routinely checked. From November, the Met Office will issue cold weather alerts if the temperature dips to 2C (35F) or less, or if there is severe winter weather such as heavy snow or widespread ice. Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection and medical director at Public Health England, said: "In colder weather, keeping yourself warm is essential to staying healthy, especially for the very young, older people or those with a chronic condition such as heart disease and asthma." Public health minister Jane Ellison said: "The elderly and those with long-term illnesses are particularly at risk during winter months so it's crucial that people stay warm." Age UK's charity director Caroline Abrahams said: "Being cold is a huge health risk for older people so it is absolutely essential that older people stay warm during the winter months. "But with fuel poverty blighting the lives of millions of households in the UK many older people are feeling increasingly anxious about the rising cost of energy. "The government must show it has a clear long-term plan to make low income homes more energy efficient." Labour's shadow energy and climate change minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: "People are being left in real hardship because David Cameron won't stand up to the energy companies. "Britain's energy is market is not working for families and business." </body>

      <description>Scottish Labour's Cara Hilton wins the Dunfermline by-election for the Scottish Parliament, taking the seat from the SNP.</description>

      <body>Labour has won the Scottish Parliament by-election in Dunfermline, after beating the SNP by almost 3,000 votes. The victory represented a gain from the SNP, who took the seat in the 2011 Holyrood election. The by-election was caused by the resignation of sitting MSP Bill Walker, who was thrown out of the SNP and jailed for domestic abuse. Cara Hilton, the parliament's newest MSP, said the people of Dunfermline "deserved better". The SNP won Dunfermline as part of its landslide election win in 2011 with a majority of just 590 votes, but was not able to hold on. In the end, Labour took the seat with a majority of 2,873 - a 7% swing from the SNP. The Liberal Democrats came third in the contest, with the Conservatives in fourth place. Ms Hilton said: "After the disgrace of Bill Walker, Dunfermline deserves better and I will ensure that we will be better - far better than what went before." And ahead of the SNP administration's independence referendum next year, she added: "We need a Scottish government that will address the needs of Scots, not one that will simply make promises about what will happen after 2016. "Today Dunfermline has sent a message to Bute House and Alex Salmond: it's time for you to focus on the real priorities of Scots, not your constitutional obsession." The by-election campaign centred on contentious local issues, including proposed school closures, while the SNP focused on its national policies such as the council tax freeze and the decision to remove the tolls on the nearby Forth Road Bridge. Despite the result, SNP candidate Shirley-Anne Somerville said she was proud of the campaign she fought. "We've run a positive campaign trying to support local parents in their schools and I hope we can come together, all of us in the party, to make sure those three schools in the Dunfermline constituency stay open," she said. The Liberal Democrats saw their vote drop by 8% on the night. Candidate Susan Leslie said: "I think it has been a victory for women in politics in Scotland that four women stood in this by-election and fought positive campaigns on the issues for Dunfermline." Scottish Conservative candidate James Reekie - whose party saw a 1% increase in its vote - added: "When the people of Dunfermline are faced with the dilemma of Labour and the SNP, they chose the Conservatives." Turnout in the by-election was 42.65%. </body>

      <title>East Coast rail sale gets under way</title>
      <description>Re-privatising the East Coast Main line will "revitalise" it, ministers say as they kick-start the franchising process, but Labour and unions attack the move.</description>

      <body>Returning the East Coast Main line to the private sector will "revitalise" it, ministers have said as they kick-started the franchising process. The line has been publicly run since 2009 when National Express handed back the franchise amid financial problems. Ministers say the line has since been "stabilised" but they now want to "rekindle the spirit of competition". Labour and the unions say the move is "ideological" and the line should remain in public ownership. They say the failure of two successive operators to make the line - which runs from London to Edinburgh, with connected services to Inverness and Aberdeen - commercially viable and its improved performance in recent years show it can succeed under public ownership. The government began the franchising process on Friday by releasing information about the line's financial position as well as the basic criteria for interested parties and details of the commercial risks involved. The successful bidder is due to be announced in a year's time with its franchise starting in February 2015. Among those reported to be interested in bidding is Eurostar, which runs services from London to the Continent. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said public ownership was never meant to be a permanent arrangement and returning the operation of the line to the private sector would bring more investment and innovation. "We want to see a revitalised East Coast railway, one that both rekindles the spirit of competition for customers on this great route and competes with the West Coast on speed, quality and customer service," he said. Rail minister Stephen Hammond told the BBC that the East Coast "lagged behind" other long-distance operators in terms of punctuality while customer satisfaction was only "in line" with other routes. "While they have done a good job, there is a lot more that can be done," he said, adding that the doubling of rail passengers since privatisation in the 1990s showed the benefits of the franchise process. Critics of privatisation say the East Coast line has returned £800m to the taxpayer under public ownership. But Mr Hammond said this was not a fair comparison as Network Rail had reduced charges for using the track substantially since National Express relinquished the franchise. The government says it is already planning "significant" investment in the line over the next six years, including new rolling stock, upgrades to the track around Peterborough and the rebuilding of Doncaster station. But it wants a private sector operator to "transform the customer experience", develop "innovative timetables" and identify further opportunities for improving stations along the 353-mile route. But Labour said the privatisation process - which was expected to be delayed until after the next election - was being driven by ideological reasons rather than the interests of passengers. The opposition say the government has "learnt nothing" from the debacle over the West Coast Main Line franchising process last year, which had to be abandoned after mistakes by civil servants led to flawed calculations. Speaking to the Financial Times, shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said Labour's review of rail policy next year would consider the case for re-nationalisation among other options. "We want a model that is going to work. What is interesting is that we have foreign state-owned railways running our services and investing money back into their own networks. "If it works as a model for them, why can't it work as a model for the UK?" The RMT union has pledged to fight the re-privatisation, saying the government is playing down the success of the line under public ownership in order to "bulldoze" the sale through. Earlier this month it claimed a leaked version of the draft sale brochure redacted sections highlighting the good punctuality and performance of the service under public ownership. "It is simply outrageous that the government are firing the starting gun on the re-privatisation of the East Coast when every objective analysis shows that this is a successful and reliable service," RMT boss Bob Crow said. And the TUC said the line needed an operator which would put passengers not shareholders first. "The government doesn't have one good argument for re-privatising the line and is yet again being blinded by outdated market dogma," said general secretary Frances O'Grady. "As with the Royal Mail, they are putting ideology before evidence in the desire to sell off yet another important state asset." </body>

      <title>MEPs vote to suspend US data sharing</title>
      <description>A non-binding vote in the EU represents growing unease about the amount of data Europe has shared with the US.</description>

      <body>The European Parliament has voted to suspend the sharing of financial data with the US, following allegations that citizens' data was spied on. The allegation forms part of leaked documents from whistleblower Edward Snowden. The vote is non-binding but illustrates MEPs' growing unease over how much data was shared with the US. It comes a day after it was alleged that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone calls were monitored. The European Parliament voted to suspend its Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP) agreement with the US, in response to the alleged tapping of EU citizens' bank data held by the Belgian company SWIFT. The agreement granted the US authorities access to bank data for terror-related investigations but leaked documents made public by whistleblower Edward Snowden allege that the global bank transfer network was the target of wider US surveillance. MEPs also want to launch a full inquiry into the alleged spying. The row over exactly how much snooping was done on European citizens appears to be escalating. Germany has summoned the US ambassador in Berlin over the claims that the US monitored Mrs Merkel's mobile phone calls. Other leaders are also likely to want further clarification from Washington over the activities of its National Security Agency (NSA) in Europe. Meanwhile student group, europe v facebook, is launching a fresh attack on how deeply the social network was involved in the US spying programme. It has won the right for a review of why the Irish data protection commissioner is not investigating the amount of European data shared with the US. Commissioner Billy Hawkes has previously claimed that there "is nothing to investigate" over Facebook's role in the PRISM programme. Max Schrem, who heads the group, remains unconvinced. "When it comes to the fundamental rights of millions of users and the biggest surveillance scandal in years, he will have to take responsibility and do something about it," he said. </body>

      <title>Salmond 'certain' on Ineos deal</title>
      <description>First Minister Alex Salmond says he is "absolutely certain" that the petrochemical plant at Grangemouth can be saved.</description>

      <body>First Minister Alex Salmond has said he is "absolutely certain" that the petrochemical plant at Grangemouth can be saved. Staff are waiting to hear if owner Ineos will grant a reprieve to the closure-threatened operation. About 800 jobs are under threat - and the company has already laid off about 2,000 contractors since it shut down the complex. Ineos will update the staff on its plans at a meeting at 11:00. Speaking on the BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Salmond said: "I would now be very hopeful indeed that there will be a change in position from Ineos and I'm absolutely certain there's a future for chemicals in Grangemouth. "I believe there will be a change in position today and that will be a favourable change in position. "My reason for saying that is that everybody has been going that extra mile I called for. "Given that only 48 hours ago we were looking at a major industrial catastrophe in Scotland, I think we're in a much better position this Friday morning." Mr Salmond said the trade unions had offered that there would be no industrial action for three years. "That's an indication that however we got to this impasse two days ago, there has now been substantial movement of people anxious to save their jobs, their livelihoods and their plants," he told the programme. Political leaders had already expressed optimism after the union accepted a survival plan put forward by Ineos. The BBC understands that an agreement was being drawn up for workers to sign, which would need approval from major Ineos shareholder Jim Ratcliffe. On Thursday, Scotland's finance secretary John Swinney and the Scottish Secretary Alastair Carmichael held talks with unions and management at the site. Afterwards they said they were hopeful. However, Ineos is yet to confirm whether it will reverse its decision to close the petrochemical plant at the complex. An internal investigation by Ineos into the union convenor, Stephen Deans, is also due to be published later. It was the firm's treatment of Mr Deans that first ignited the breakdown in industrial relations - before it became a battle for the survival of Scotland's largest industrial site. The dispute at the site escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but Ineos shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a survival plan, which was initially rejected by union members. The proposals included ending their final salary pension scheme and cut shift allowances. Previously, Ineos said it was ready to invest £300m in Grangemouth if workers agreed to the new terms and conditions. The company said it had decided to close the plant because half the workforce had refused to accept the cost-cutting plan essential for the facility's survival. Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the neighbouring refinery would go as well. The refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. Ineos had said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week. </body>

      <body>The Respect party no longer has any councillors in Bradford after they all resigned, accusing George Galloway of defamation and lack of transparency. The five councillors, elected in a surge of local support for Respect last year, temporarily resigned in August but have now left the party altogether. Two were suspended over criticism of Mr Galloway's plans to stand for London mayor, and he questioned their loyalty. Respect said the councillors' conduct had been "unacceptable". The five councillors are Alyas Karmani, Ruqaya Collector, Faisal Khan, Ishtiaq Ahmed and Mohammed Shabbir. Speaking to The Guardian in August, they criticised Mr Galloway, saying he should step down as an MP if he wanted to fight in the 2016 London mayoral election. In response to the article, Mr Galloway accused the councillors of "destabilising the party" and "conniving with the Khans", in reference to his former aide Aisha Ali Khan and her police officer husband Det Insp Afiz Khan who have been charged with misconduct offences. Mr Ahmed and Mr Shabbir were suspended by national party managers the same day. In a statement issued on Friday the councillors said they had been in discussions with senior party officials over the past two months to address their concerns about the "unwarranted" suspensions, "defamatory" statements made about them and a "failure to develop transparent operations structures and procedures to enable the party to work effectively in Bradford". They said: "Regrettably, these discussions have failed to find common ground as senior Respect officials have shown a disregard to address our legitimate grievances and we have been unable to resolve our issues of difference. "After much deliberation this has left our group no choice but to fully resign from the Respect party with immediate effect." The councillors said they would continue as independents for the remainder of their terms. Respect said talks between party officials and the councillors had "foundered on the unacceptable conduct of the councillors", who it accused of regularly speaking out against the party. It said Mr Ahmed and Mr Shabir were expelled by the party on Thursday, the day the councillors say they informed officials of their resignation. A Respect statement said the councillors' visibility and impact in the council chamber "has been virtually non-existent". "If they had a shred of principle they would now resign their council seats and stand again in their new colours. Or will they instead continue to draw thousands of pounds of public money until they are removed by the voters?" </body>

      <title>Clegg and PM at odds on green levies</title>
      <description>Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg says he does not agree with the prime minister's bid to "roll back" green levies pushing up energy bills.</description>

      <body>David Cameron announcement that he wanted to "roll back" green levies pushing up energy bills was unexpected, Nick Clegg has said. "It's not something that I fully agree with," the deputy prime minister told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. But the Lib Dem leader confirmed that the government was to look into whether its environmental policies could be delivered more cost-effectively. They may be funded in future from taxes rather than green levies, he suggested. He insisted that the coalition's environmental objectives "remain clear and stable". And Downing Street later said work was under way to examine how green levies "can be rolled back from the bills" and paid for by alternative funding. But Labour leader Ed Miliband accused the government of coming up with a "panicked wheeze paid for by taxpayers". During his Today interview Mr Clegg said in the weeks ahead he and Mr Cameron would "stress-test all these different levies". "If we can deliver those objectives of keeping the lights on, insulating people's homes helping the fuel-poor, supporting the green economy for less, of course I don't want to see an extra penny go on people's bills that is absolutely necessary." But funding for "looking after the environment, securing thousands of jobs in the renewable green sector, and... giving deductions on people's fuel bills for two million of the poorest households in our country" should not end, he argued. This was not the biggest factor driving up energy bills, Mr Clegg added: "In fact, 60% of the increase in energy bills since 2010 have come from wholesale prices." There was, he said, a "big argument" on energy policy, especially since Labour's announcement that it plans to freeze energy bills for 20 months if it wins the next general election. "You've got an argument from Ed Miliband, and it is a con, by the way: his freeze would see prices go up, jobs go down, investment go down. "And then you appear to have a new kind of theory emerging from the right of British politics, which says it is all the fault of us caring about the environment. "I don't accept either of those propositions." Mr Clegg also stressed that he was confident he and the prime minister could "resolve" their differences on the policy. On Wednesday at his weekly Commons question session, Mr Cameron told MPs: "We need to help people pay their bills and we need to help to get bills down. "We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills." The Liberal Democrats subsequently accused the PM of making a "panicky U-turn". A senior Lib Dem source said Mr Cameron had got "cold feet" on environmental policy promises. In a speech, Mr Miliband argued the prime minister had "lost control" of his government amid differences between Conservatives and Liberal Democrats on energy policy. He accused Mr Cameron of "weakness" and offering no solution to rising household costs, adding: "Governments have always looked at this balance but this government wants you to pick up the tab for its failure to stand up to the energy companies. That won't offer the real help that business and families need. "They propose a panicked wheeze paid for by taxpayers. We offer a real freeze paid for by the big energy companies." </body>

      <title>Labour 'backed HS2 to upstage Tories'</title>
      <description>Former Business Secretary Lord Mandelson says Labour originally approved the HS2 rail project to "upstage" the Conservatives.</description>

      <body>Former Business Secretary Lord Mandelson has said Labour originally approved the High Speed Two rail project to "upstage" the Conservatives. He told the House of Lords his party "did not feel like being trumped" over creating a fast north-south link by the Tories, then in opposition. Lord Mandelson said he now thought there was "flimsy evidence" to back the multi-billion-pound project. But the government insists it will boost the UK economy. HS2 is intended to allow trains to run at 250mph (400km/h) from London to Birmingham from 2026, with branches to Manchester and Leeds via Sheffield planned for 2033. The estimated cost of the plan has risen in the past few months from £34.2bn to £42.6bn - plus £7.5bn for rolling stock. Gordon Brown's government debated the issue before deciding in favour. Lord Mandelson said: "Frankly, there was too much of the argument that if everyone else has got a high-speed train we should have one too... We didn't feel like being trumped by the then opposition's support for the high-speed train. We wanted, if anything, to upstage them." Lord Mandelson was a keen supporter of HS2 when he was in government, but earlier this year suggested the project should be scrapped. He told the Lords that Labour's front bench was right to have become "more sceptical", adding: "I have been an ardent pro-railway supporter all my adult life. But it is precisely for that reason that I do not support HS2. "I think the sheer cost of it will suck the very life blood out of the rest of the country's rail system." The Labour peer said Sir Rod Eddington's report on transport in 2006 had been forgotten. It had "firmly rejected" HS2 and concluded that a "wide range of incremental improvements" would be better. He also said HS2 was a "political trophy project justified on flimsy evidence to be about modernity and prosperity". But Liberal Democrat Lord Greaves had backed the project as "sensible, necessary and long overdue". He said the rail scheme would herald a new era for Britain's railways and help close the "regional divide". And Labour former minister Lord Rooker hit back at Lord Mandelson's criticism of HS2, saying: "The Labour government started this project and it will be inconceivable to withdraw support. "I am getting cheesed-off listening to ex-ministers swanning around the political salons pouring cold water on this project." In response to Lord Mandelson's comments, a Downing Street spokesman said: "The prime minister's position on HS2 is well stated. We need to invest in high-speed rail in this country. "It is essential for solving the capacity crisis and research from KPMG has shown there could be a £15bn annual boost to the economy. "The prime minister is clear in his support for HS2 and wants the process to go on and the railway to be built." </body>

      <title>Fox raises doubts over soldier cuts</title>
      <description>Plans to recruit more Army reservists might have to be reversed if work commitments mean they are not as easy to deploy at speed as regular soldiers, Liam Fox says.</description>

      <body>Plans to recruit more Army reservists might have to be reversed if work commitments mean they are not as easy to deploy at speed as regular soldiers, Liam Fox has said. The former defence secretary told The House magazine there had to be "guarantees that we would be able to get the numbers". The coalition is taking on 30,000 reservists to cover Army cuts. The MoD said it was committed to delivering "challenging" targets. But Mr Fox predicted "constant" manpower challenges. The North Somerset MP, a former doctor who came third in the 2005 Conservative leadership election, is a popular figure on the right of the party. He resigned from the cabinet position in October 2011 over his relationship with his friend the lobbyist Adam Werritty. Last year, he had to repay £3,000 of expenses after it was found he had allowed Mr Werritty to live at his taxpayer-funded second home for a year rent-free. The government wants to expand the Reserve Force, formerly the Territorial Army, to 30,000 by 2018 to help fill gaps left by cuts to the regular Army. The Army is due to lose 17 major units as it cuts 20,000 regular soldiers by 2020. Questioned about this, Mr Fox said: "When I was secretary of state, I said we would only decrease the numbers of regulars when we had guarantees that we would be able to get the numbers - training and equipping up of the reserves - to match." He raised doubts about the feasibility of the project, saying: "It brings with it new problems. If you're going to use reserves instead of regulars and are depending on them, you need to be able to get them when you want them, which is a change in relationships with employers. "That's something that has to be managed. Otherwise there might be a major disincentive for any employer to take on someone who is in the reserves. All these things will have to be ironed out." Mr Fox added: "I think we need to keep a constant eye on the number of reservists. Otherwise there will be a risk that we would have to put in to reverse the policy. That's a constant challenge and, of course, as the economy recovers it will become more difficult to recruit and retain. "There will be challenges on manpower, definitely, throughout this decade, challenges in the balance ahead. We'll have to see how the employment market goes and work accordingly." A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: "The decision made two years ago to grow the Army Reserve to 30,000 will deliver a fully integrated force of 120,000 made up of regulars and reserves by 2018. "This is a challenging target, but one we are committed to achieving. As the chief of the defence staff has said, the Army is pulling out all the stops to ensure we deliver this new force. "These changes will ensure that we have an Army that is affordable and sustainable in the long term. We have just started a sustained recruitment campaign alongside an investment of £1.8bn in training and equipment for the reserves. "But the Army has to manage its budget and the planned steady reduction in the size of the regular army to its target level, as the reserves build up, is the best way to deliver the required output." </body>

      <description>MPs reject Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt's preferred candidate to chair England's health service regulator, Monitor.</description>

      <body>MPs have rejected Jeremy Hunt's choice of candidate to lead England's health service regulator. Dominic Dodd was not "the right person" to take over from current Monitor chairman David Bennett, the health select committee said. The committee divided along party lines, with three Labour MPs out-voting two coalition ones. But the decision is not binding on the health secretary, who is said to be considering his next move. The committee released a brief statement on its decision, after it had grilled Mr Dodd at a pre-appointment hearing. It said: "Dr Bennett has both shaped and interpreted the role that Monitor now plays in the system, which makes the transition to another individual taking on the chair an especially difficult one. "We do not think Mr Dodd is the right person to undertake that difficult transition. On this basis we do not endorse Mr Dodd's appointment." The Conservative chairman of the committee, Stephen Dorrell, initially proposed that the committee should approve Mr Dodd's appointment but review his progress after six months, putting on record that it wanted to "hear further from him about how he plans to hold the chief executive to account and handle conflicts of interest". But a motion to withhold the committee's endorsement was put forward by Labour MP Barbara Keeley and backed by Labour colleagues Grahame Morris and Valerie Vaz. It was opposed by Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston and Liberal Democrat Andrew George. Mr Dorrell did not vote. The other Conservative members of the committee, Charlotte Leslie, Andrew Percy and David Tredinnick, did not attend the meeting on Wednesday. In a letter to the committee ahead of the meeting, Mr Hunt named Mr Dodd as "my preferred candidate for appointment". Currently the chairman of the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, Mr Dodd is also director of an academic health science system, UCL Partners, and non-executive director of Permanent TSB Group Holdings. He was previously a senior executive at management consultants Marakon Associates, whose clients include private healthcare firms. Under reforms of the NHS introduced by the coalition, Monitor is responsible for making sure public sector health providers are well led and overseeing choice and competition in the sector. A Department of Health spokesman said: "We have received the Health Select Committee report and will announce the next steps shortly." </body>

      <title>Press seeks Leveson legal challenge</title>
      <description>A newspaper industry group is to seek a judicial review after its plans for press regulation were rejected earlier this month, the BBC learns.</description>

      <body>A newspaper industry group is to seek a judicial review after its regulation plans were rejected earlier this month. The Privy Council, which rejected the industry plans, had been expected to rubber stamp a plan agreed by the main Westminster parties in the next week. Opponents say this plan could result in the end of the free press and hope the legal move will delay its approval but the government says it will push ahead. The row follows the phone-hacking scandal and subsequent Leveson inquiry. An newspaper industry source said the judicial review application would be formally lodged in the High Court on Monday. One senior industry source also said they hoped the bid for a review would put a "spoke in the wheels" of the Westminster plan. "It's very hard to imagine them proceeding next week to file their Royal Charter when the previous decision is subject to judicial review," he said. Some in the industry have warned that a system decided by politicians risks bringing an end to press freedom. The Newspaper Society said the press's preferred charter was not handled fairly as the Privy Council committee - which is set to agree the final proposals on 30 October - failed to consult the press. The judicial review application will be made by Pressbof (Press Standards Board of Finance), the industry body that funds the current Press Complaints Commission. Pressbof's chairman Lord Black of Brentwood said: "The government and the Privy Council should have applied the most rigorous standards of consultation and examination of the Royal Charter proposed by the industry, which would have enshrined tough regulatory standards at the same time as protecting press freedom. "They singularly failed to do so, and that is why - as the issues at stake are so extraordinarily high - we are having to take this course of action." The campaign group which represents some victims of press intrusion, Hacked Off, accused the press of being predictable and self serving. The group's director Brian Cathcart said: "The people leading this part of the newspaper industry are exposing themselves as desperate and deaf. "Desperate, because they are now resorting to a legal challenge to something based on the findings of a public inquiry, and backed by the victims of press abuse, all parties in Parliament and the overwhelming majority of the public. "Deaf, because they refuse to listen to the evidence that there is no threat to the free press and that this deal actually benefits the press, both financially and in terms of freedom of expression." Meanwhile, the press is highlighting plans to set up its own regulator under its own rules. Documents including a contract to bind publishers and the regulations under which a new regulator would work were due to be published online at 19:00 BST. They expect the new regulator to be operating by next year. A spokesman for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport commented: "The government is working to bring in a system of independent press self-regulation that will protect press freedom while offering real redress when mistakes are made. "The culture secretary pushed hard for recent changes on arbitration and the standards code to be made, which will ensure the system is workable and the decision to go to court is particularly disappointing in light of these changes." </body>

      <body>The Northern Ireland Executive has been challenged to reform how it delivers key infrastructure projects such as roads and energy links as a matter of urgency. CBI Northern Ireland said it was "incredibly frustrated at the lack of an appropriate pipeline of works" that would attract investment and new jobs. It has published a new report, calling for several projects to be prioritised. The projects include a second north-south electricity inter-connector. CBI Northern Ireland believes a new Stormont agency should be created and charged with the procurement and delivery of major projects. The agency would report directly to the finance minister. Other schemes the CBI wants action on are strategic roads like the York Street interchange in Belfast and the A6 road to Londonderry. CBI vice-chair Adrian Eakin said: "Relatively simple steps can make our system more fit for purpose and project a view to investors that Northern Ireland is a place which puts delivery of infrastructure top of its agenda. "Northern Ireland cannot afford to be behind the curve." The organisation said the Northern Ireland Executive should explore all avenues of funding such as the European Investment Bank. Its ideas are contained in its new report called Infrastructure - Investing for our Future. </body>

      <title>Sharp rise in council's rent arrears</title>
      <description>North Lanarkshire Council claims more than 2,000 of its tenants are in rent arrears for the first time after housing benefit changes.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24662376</url>
      <date>1382706036</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70698000/jpg/_70698042_houses.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>More than 2,000 people in one part of Scotland have got into rent arrears for the first time since changes to housing benefit were made in the spring. North Lanarkshire Council thinks it is owed £675,000 from tenants because of the spare room subsidy - dubbed the bedroom tax, by critics. The council is the largest local authority landlord in Scotland. It also believes many people who could be eligible for help to deal with their benefit cut have not applied for it. This is the most detailed assessment so far of the impact of the changes on one council area in Scotland. More than 5,000 council tenants in North Lanarkshire lost some of their housing benefit in April because they were deemed to have spare bedrooms. An analysis produced by the council - covering the six months up to September - said 2,333 tenants who previously had no rent arrears owed the authority money by September. A further 1,100 already had rent arrears before the changes took place. This meant that 3,449 of the 5,201 people who lost some of their housing benefit in North Lanarkshire had rent arrears. Overall, rent arrears over the past six months were up by two thirds compared to the same period last year though the council was stressing the changes to housing benefit were only one reason for this. Tenants now owe the council more than £2.5m in total. The council said about £675,000 of these arrears could be the result of the benefit changes. However, the council also believes that some people who could have been helped by the special discretionary housing payments, available to those affected by the benefit changes, may not have applied for them. This means that some of the arrears may have been avoidable - or that there could have been help for people who have struggled to make up for the loss of benefit. North Lanarkshire said it would not evict tenants solely because of spare room subsidy arrears during this financial year as long as they had contacted the housing service for assistance and advice. A spokesman said: "Clearly the UK government's welfare reforms are already having a significant effect on our tenants. "The council has set aside funds to assist vulnerable people in every way possible but it is essential that tenants who are worried or in difficulty talk to us. "We have hired additional trained advisers who can discuss each case and provide help with applications for financial assistance. We have already helped thousands of people, so anyone who needs that assistance should contact their local housing office." Council leader Jim McCabe condemned the UK government's changes to housing benefit but urged people who have been affected to speak to the council to see if help could be provided. The council has nearly £1.2m available to hand out in these payments - £470,000 of it is from the UK government, the rest is from the council's own budget. So far it has paid out £350,000 in these payments to nearly 2,900 people. Separate figures from the council give some indication of the scale of the arrears that individuals are building up. As of last week, about 460 people have arrears equivalent to the cut in their benefit while 500 have built up new arrears since April of an even greater amount. The other tenants with arrears appear to have tried to make up some of the shortfall or have received help. The Scottish Conservatives' welfare spokesman Alex Johnstone MSP said the figures showed that the issue of welfare reform was not as black and white as the Scottish government, and what he called the "left-wing establishment", would like to make out. Mr Johnstone said: "Welfare reform is a challenge that must be addressed so that it is fair to those who receive, and fair on those who pay for it. "The ever-growing cost of the welfare budget is something which successive governments have failed to address. "But the 'ignore the problem and it might go away' approach simply hasn't worked and has only resulted in fostering a culture of people being left to languish on benefits for years." A spokesperson for the UK Department for Work and Pensions said: "Scotland has been given £10m this year to help vulnerable people and we are monitoring this spending carefully to ensure that tenants get the support they need during welfare reforms. "It is important to remember that housing benefit will still cover the vast majority of people's rent, but the taxpayer can no longer afford to pay for spare bedrooms. "People have a number of options available to them, including moving to another property in the public or private sector, or making up the difference in rent through going into work or working more hours." Scottish Housing Minister Margaret Burgess said: "We know that 80% of households affected by the bedroom tax contain an adult with a recognised disability, and over 15,000 children are affected. "That's why have consistently expressed our opposition to this measure. "The Scottish government is doing all it can to help the people hit by the bedroom tax, with £20m of funding available this year and a further £20m available next year." </body>

      <title>'Devastating' college cuts warning</title>
      <description>Cuts to further education budgets in Wales are "short-sighted" and could damage life-long learning, say teaching unions and charities.</description>

      <body>Cuts to further education (FE) budgets in Wales are "short-sighted" and could damage life-long learning, say teaching unions and charities. The Welsh government is proposing £44.9m of cuts in the FE sector next year and a further £42.5m the following year. The ATL teaching union said there would be a "devastating" impact. The Welsh government said it would work closely with colleges "to minimise the impact of any reductions on learning". Most of the proposed cuts will fall on post-19 further education, which is losing almost a quarter of a £160m budget. "We're talking about very positive things here, about courses which help with the difficult to reach, which help the Neets (not in education, employment or training), those who have been out of work for a long time, courses which help people to upskill and get better jobs," said Dr Phil Dixon from the ATL union. "And I think if those go, then a lot of people in the sector will be very demoralised." His concerns have been echoed by the University and College Union (UCU), which said colleges would struggle to deliver the level of services needed in Wales if the cuts went ahead. "The FE sector is a key player that should not be ignored," said a UCU spokesperson. "It provides a lifeline for many adults who want a second chance at education, enabling them to improve opportunities for themselves and therefore their children. "If reducing child poverty is a top priority for the Welsh government, the role that FE can play in this needs to be taken seriously and funded accordingly." Last year there were almost 250,000 learners in FE colleges in Wales, with three-quarters over the age of 19 and many studying part time. The colleges provide courses on a huge range of subjects including everything from basket weaving and brick laying to advanced manufacturing and engineering. Many of the courses are vocational but academic qualifications are also offered. The Welsh government's own analysis said the cuts would have a disproportionate impact on women, who are more likely to be adult learners, as well as those from an ethnic minority background. It also said it would make it more difficult for those who are out of work to re-train. The National Institute of Adult Continuing Education in Wales (NIACE) charity, said there were "wider benefits" in adult learning and now was not a time to cut the budget. "The effect of the cuts will be a reduction of the number of adult learners in Wales and NIACE Dysgu Cymru would advocate that at such a difficult time, we should be maintaining or even increasing funding for life-long learning for all sorts of reasons," said Essex Havard from NIACE. "There is a lot of research around the area of being an active learner and being a healthy adult, particularly in the area around mental health issues... adult learning can help people to get on with their lives after trauma, for example. "So these are the things we'd want to talk to the Welsh government about - about the wider benefits of adult learning, and of the wider impact of those cuts on the adult learning and life-long education budget." The Welsh government has protected provision aimed at 16-19 year olds, so post-19 further education will bear the brunt of the cuts. Around £37m is due to be cut from post-19 learning next year, a 23% reduction from its £160m budget. Responding to the criticisms about the cuts, the Welsh government said it had been "open about the stark reality" of the financial challenges being faced. "But as we work through these difficult times, it is ever more important that we focus not just on the resources that are available but how we use them and what we achieve," said a spokesperson. "We will work closely with the post-16 sector to evaluate available options and to minimise the impact of any reductions on learning. "This will be the case for any sector that may be impacted by reductions." </body>

      <title>Heseltine plea on 'decaying' towns</title>
      <description>A magazine article which suggested that government money should no longer be spent on some deprived English towns and cities is criticised by former cabinet minister Lord Heseltine.</description>

      <body>The former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine has dismissed claims that "failing" towns and cities should be abandoned by the government. An article in The Economist suggested that a number of industrial towns were "decaying" and their inhabitants should be encouraged to find jobs elsewhere. The magazine listed Hull, Burnley, Middlesbrough and Hartlepool as places where "dollops of public money" had failed to boost the local economy, despite years of heroic effort. The article has caused an outcry in Hull, where the city council leader described its recommendations as "disgusting". In an interview for the Sunday Politics in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, Lord Heseltine said similar claims were made about Liverpool in the 1980s. Michael Heseltine was appointed by Margaret Thatcher to lead the regeneration of Liverpool, following riots in the city in 1981. The former Conservative cabinet minister claims the best way to stimulate economic growth in deprived towns and cities is to devolve more power away from Whitehall. Lord Heseltine said: "What I have argued over decades is that we should say to cities what would you do? "Because you know what Leeds needs, what Bradford needs and what Hull needs." Former Liverpool MP Peter Kilfoyle told me there had been numerous calls over the years to turn-off the government spending taps on Merseyside. Mr Kilfoyle, who served as a Labour minister under Tony Blair, said: "We had a think-tank a few years ago which said that Liverpool should be abandoned and everybody should move to the south. "This is nonsense. Any forward looking government would want to invest in Hull, just as they invested in Liverpool." Cabinet papers from 1981 reveal the chancellor of the exchequer at the time - Sir Geoffrey Howe - raised the possibility of a programme of "managed decline" in Liverpool. However, Lord Howe recently said there was never a suggestion that Liverpool should be abandoned by the Conservative government in the 1980s. </body>

      <description>As Labour-run local authorities warn over new cuts, Eric Pickles accuses them of "shroud waving".</description>

      <body>The battle lines are being drawn. Within the next few months, our large local authorities will outline where the spending axe will fall on local services. It's become an annual fixture in the political calendar. By the end of this parliament, councils will have seen their budgets squeezed by one third, with the prospect of further cuts after the next general election. But in the East Midlands, there are two new players. Both Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire are now Labour controlled; and since the party's victory in May's local elections, hardly a day has passed without a dire warning of the tough choices having to be taken by the new leadership to balance the books. The Communities Secretary Eric Pickles this week got his retaliation in first. He told MPs that complaining Labour authorities were more interested in "shroud-waving" and cutting front-line services. He's also been brushing down his "50 Ways to Save", his guide to councils to make the most of their budgets. It'll be no surprise that the leader of Derbyshire county council, Labour's Anne Western, takes a very different view of the financial challenges facing her authority in the next budget round. "You can either shrink and shrink your services until there's nothing left, or we can reinvent what we do," she told me. "In the six months since we took control, we've been talking to partners like the NHS. Our priority is what the people of Derbyshire want." That may be music to the ears of the Communities Secretary. He's been encouraging councils to reach out to other organisations to share costs. "To be frank, this is the future," he said. "It makes sense to work together on procurement, joint use of offices and shared services." One key area for Anne Western is the provision of council-run residential care services for the elderly. Derbyshire has 26 such care homes and spends £72m annually on care services, one of the highest of any shire county. Many of its neighbouring authorities have already sold-off or part-privatised the service. Anne Western said: "People get a huge sense of confidence when the service is council-run because of the quality of the staff and the training. It's also more accountable." Only a few weeks ago, the prime minister dismissed warnings from Anne Western over the consequences of budget cuts on services and jobs in Derbyshire. He described additional council cuts following the chancellor's budget as "relatively modest". "He's just playing with numbers," replied Anne Western. "It's not just me as a Labour leader. There are Conservative leaders up and down the country arguing the case for a rethink on budgets." Rethink? From the Communities Secretary? That may look unlikely. What's more likely is Eric Pickles quoting from a recent BBC/ ICM survey . It indicated that many people believe local council services - rubbish collection, libraries and schools - have actually improved in the past few years. In the months ahead, watch out for those battle lines being drawn. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Beginner's guide to PM's speech</title>
      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant? What has happened? Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning. Why the big deal about the speech? Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech. So what did Cameron say? Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech. What sorts of powers does the UK want back? The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK." Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders? The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK. So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU? David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market." What has been the reaction in the UK? Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement. Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party. The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts. What about the reaction around Europe? The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction. What about the reaction from business? A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".

      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle. The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011. As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign. Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury. Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011. Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development. Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. The MP for Leeds West was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament. A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader. As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest. One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress. Moving to defence from shadow Northern Ireland secretary in October 2013, the MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted having smoked cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip. The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011. One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the Cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. She supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leader of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. Chris Leslie has been appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the latest Labour frontbench reshuffle. The former Bradford councillor was elected MP for Shipley - a Tory stronghold in Yorkshire - in 1997. He held several junior positions in the former Labour government within the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He lost his Shipley seat in 2005, but re-entered Parliament in 2010 as MP for Nottingham East. He went on to serve as shadow financial secretary to the Treasury on Labour's front bench in the Commons. Mary Creagh has moved from shadow environment secretary to shadow transport secretary in October 2013. When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest. Maria Eagle moved in October 2013 to shadow environment secretary in a job swap with Mary Creagh. She is the sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. She held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player. Jim Murphy was moved - demoted in many people's eyes - in October 2013 from shadow defence secretary. He is a Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign. He has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football. Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008. In Holyrood, she held various posts, including minister for communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws. Before entering politics she was a lecturer in community education. The then 52-year-old took up her first full shadow cabinet role in October 2011. Jon Trickett takes over from the departing Tom Watson as deputy Labour party chair. Gordon Brown's former parliamentary aide, Mr Trickett previously attended shadow cabinet as a junior minister and became a full member as shadow Cabinet Office minister in Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle. The then 61-year-old MP for Hemsworth took over the role from Tessa Jowell. Michael Dugher became shadow Cabinet Office minister in October 2013 after attending the shadow cabinet as shadow minister without portfolio. Mr Dugher won the seat of Barnsley East at the 2010 General Election, after serving as chief political spokesman for the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Having joined the ranks of the Labour parliamentary party, he then became a parliamentary private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband. He is also currently vice-chairman of the Labour Party. Gloria De Piero was appointed shadow women and equalities minister in the October 2013 reshuffle. The former GMTV political editor was an political admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as party leader. She was elected as MP for Ashfield at the 2010 General Election and appointed to a junior role in the shadow Department for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport. Since October 2011, Ms De Piero has served as a junior shadow Home Office minister. Former BBC radio producer and special adviser who has risen quickly through the ranks. The then 40-year-old was elected in 2010 for Pontypridd, but previously stood unsuccessfully in the 2006 Blaenau Gwent by-election where he lost to independent Dai Davies. He supported Ed Miliband for the leadership and was given a role in his shadow team five months after entering the House, first as shadow Wales minister and then in the shadow Treasury team. This is his first shadow cabinet role. Moving from shadow minister for international development in October 2013, former charity worker and chief executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation, Mr Lewis held a string of junior ministerial posts in the Labour government after becoming an MP in 1997 at the age of 31. He started out as a parliamentary private secretary to then Trade Secretary Stephen Byers, before going on to be an education minister, Treasury minister, health minister and international development minister. Most recently, he was minister of state at the Foreign Office. His previous shadow cabinet role was as culture spokesman in which he was a vocal campaigner on phone hacking. The then 52-year-old was elected unopposed in a ballot for chief whip in 2010. A former local government minister, the Doncaster Central MP is responsible for maintaining discipline among Labour MPs in crucial Commons votes. Continues to lead her party in the Lords, having done the job, while in government, under Gordon Brown. She is also a spokesman on education, work and pensions, Northern Ireland and equality issues. Born in 1955, she started her political career as a special adviser to Neil - now Lord - Kinnock in the 1980s. A long-serving leader of Brighton and Hove Council, Lord Bassam was given a peerage in 1997 at the age of 44. The former local government official has continued as Labour's chief whip in the Lords, having done the job since before the 2010 general election. </body>

      <body>France and Germany have announced they are to seek new rules for intelligence co-operation with the United States following their dispute with Washington over spying. The move follows revelations that US intelligence agencies may have been monitoring the mobile phone of the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and millions of French phone calls. The former security minister, Lord West, told the Today programme while the events are embarrassing they come as no surprise: "Clearly it's extremely embarrassing when something is written down on paper which shows, does seem to show that they were trying to collect information on the phones of those particular people." "I've always worked on the assumption... that people were listening to my phone calls and trying to get information from me; and I know they jolly well were," he said. "It's a reality of the nasty world we live in," he added. First broadcast on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday 25 October 2013. </body>

The environmental campaigner said "no more than 9%" of fuel bills could be attributed to green measures, and he was "baffled by this obsession with nuclear power".

      <title>Red tape, not red lines</title>
      <description>A different focus for David Cameron at the EU summit?</description>

      <body>Time and again British leaders would come to Brussels pledging to defend their "red lines" in negotiations. As these had often been thrashed out in advance behind the scenes, they could go home with "victory" secured. This time it isn't red lines, but red tape. David Cameron is coming to the EU summit threatening to "hold Brussels' feet to the fire". For the prime minister, that fire would preferably be a bonfire of regulations. He will be flanked by two members of his business task force - Marc Bolland of MandS, and Dale Murray, an investor in new enterprises - and their message will be that growth is being held back across the continent because of the burdens placed on wealth-creating companies. But the European Commission is wondering what all the fuss is about. Its centre-right President Jose Manuel Barroso says he has cut 5,000 regulations in recent years. He would take personal credit for stopping new health and safety restrictions on hairdressers which could have stopped them wearing high heels at work. And he's grounded a directive on soil that had been discussed for the past eight years. The Commission says that the debate on deregulation shouldn't take up too much time at the summit, but David Cameron will be spending quite a bit of his time in Brussels talking about it. This includes a meeting on the margins with Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, and the leaders of some other northern European countries who want to see further cuts in regulation - and new rules headed off. But David Cameron has made great play of not just reducing the burden of regulation, but suggesting that there are some areas where Brussels shouldn't be regulating at all. To the delight and relief of many of his backbenchers who have been viewing UKIP's rise with trepidation, he promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Brussels ahead of the referendum he'll hold on EU membership if he is still prime minister in 2017. But the Commission says that, while he has talked to them about EU-wide regulations, he has barely uttered a word on the repatriation of powers. There has been a discussion on what justice measures UK ministers will opt in to, having said they would exercise the blanket opt-out bequeathed to them by Tony Blair. But beyond that, nothing. No mention of the economic and social measures that it had been assumed that Britain wanted back - for example on working hours. Now, Downing Street has a rather straightforward response. The means of renegotiating would come through any further attempts to alter EU treaties. For example if Mrs Merkel wanted a new treaty to incorporate the recent inter-governmental arrangements on the eurozone, Britain would seize the opportunity to ask for something in return for their agreement. But with a new German coalition not yet in place, treaty change hasn't been on the agenda. Privately some Conservatives suspect that the difficulty of renegotiating - and getting the agreement of 27 other countries - might be concentrating the prime minister's mind. Therefore, if he can argue that he has taken the lead in changing Brussels for the better - and that they have joined with him in making the EU more business friendly, then there is perhaps less need to grab back some powers. He could then go in to the referendum, if it is held, arguing that EU is a very different beast from the one he was dealing with at the time of his Europe speech, thanks to the alliance he has built with northern European nations and centre-right governments. Downing Street insists there has been no shift in position. </body>

      <title>Consulting... and ignoring</title>
      <description>What is the point of government consultations?</description>

      <body>What is the point of government consultations? I pose the question at the end of a week in which ministers responded to three official consultations on three controversial proposals - and appeared to ignore the results from them all. On Monday, the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) published its response to a consultation on planned changes to the assessment of people with disabilities in determining their entitlement to benefits. The government had conducted the consultation, it said, "in a fully open-minded manner". Ministers had carefully considered all the views expressed. The consultation focused on plans limiting entitlement to extra help for mobility needs to those who cannot walk 20m. The overwhelming response was that this was a bad idea. "Respondents felt there was no evidence to support the use of 20m," the consultation reported, pointing out "that other government policies use 50m as a measure of mobility". In a section entitled "What you told us", the DWP notes concern that the plan "could increase isolation and reduce independence, have significant financial impact, and cause deterioration in their physical and mental health". Respondents warned that the 20m criteria would mean some disabled people needing support from other public services, increasing the cost for the government. "The most common suggestion made by respondents", the DWP reports, "was to extend the qualifying distance for the enhanced rate from 20m to a longer distance". Nowhere in the government's response to the consultation is there evidence that anyone thought the 20m criteria was the right policy. "Having considered all these factors", the DWP response concludes, "the government believes that the use of 20m is the best way of identifying those whose physical mobility is most limited". It is, of course, the democratic right of ministers to consult and to listen and then ignore. The arguments put forward by the DWP may be compelling. But it does lead some to ask whether the consultation really had much value. A similar question might be posed following the government's response on Tuesday to consultations on two proposals concerning immigrants. The Home Office published the results of the public consultation on plans for a levy on temporary non-EEA migrants as a contribution towards the costs of possible NHS care while in the UK. It is a move that ministers claim enjoys considerable public support, but the consultation came back with a rather different view. On the principle of a levy, "34% felt that temporary migrants should make a direct contribution to the costs of their healthcare. Sixty-two per cent disagreed," it found. The Home Office notes differences depending upon the "type of respondent". Among the general public, 65% were against the plan. Among organisations that responded, 77% were opposed. Health-sector respondents, however, were in favour - 66% felt temporary migrants should contribute to the cost of their healthcare. It is the view of 235 health sector respondents, representing around 12% of the total, that appears to have swayed ministers most. "We have considered all responses to these questions carefully but remain convinced that only permanent migrants should be automatically eligible for free NHS care." Consultations are not referendums. In a way, it seems odd the Home Office should go to such trouble to quantify the proportions for and against the policy since the exercise is not designed as an X-factor style public vote. But having conducted a public consultation and expressing gratitude to all those "who have taken the time to respond and to those who have contributed their experience and insight to what is a complex issue", one is left wondering what the point was. The government response to a separate consultation, also published on Tuesday, invites the same question. This time the proposal under scrutiny was the introduction of a legal obligation on landlords to check the immigration status of tenants. "While between one-third and two-fifths of respondents supported the proposal," the Home Office response states, "slightly more than half of all respondents disagreed." The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors considered it "inappropriate to use private landlords and lettings agents to help deliver the government's immigration policy". The majority of landlord representative organisations were opposed. "The most widely expressed concern by third sector organisations," the Home Office reveals, "was the potential to impact on vulnerable people, such as those who were homeless, those with learning difficulties and those fleeing domestic abuse". The response? "The government has carefully considered the responses to the consultation and remains convinced of an urgent need for action to deter illegal migration and to safeguard the legitimate housing market." The consultation may lead to ministers including an amendment designed to counter discrimination against foreign national tenants. But on the broad proposal, it seems the exercise has not shifted government thinking one jot. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), "public consultation is one of the key regulatory tools employed to improve transparency, efficiency and effectiveness of regulation". But there has long been scepticism as to whether such exercises are anything more than cosmetic. The public consultation is an opportunity for ministers to test their ideas with experts, those directly affected and voters more generally. Community participation on proposed legislation is seen as a key component of "citizen power". But formal public consultation exercises very rarely result in a government re-think - even if they reveal profound concern. That is not the point of them, and we should not pretend otherwise. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Green taxes</title>
      <description>What are they and how do they affect our bills?</description>

      <body>The past few months have been dominated by a debate over energy prices, with all the political parties coming up with ideas to try to bring them down. The prime minister has announced a review into how the government's climate change policies - so-called green levies or taxes - affect bills and whether they are delivering value for money. But what exactly are these green taxes and how do they affect our bills? UK household dual fuel - electricity and gas - energy bills in 2013 are estimated to be about £1,267, based on average levels of energy consumption. What is that made up of? The chart below shows what the Department of Energy and Climate Change says makes up (in % terms) the average household energy bill. So green energy measures make up 9% of that cost, or £112. The average price of gas and electricity paid by UK households has risen by about 18% and 9% in real terms since 2010 and by about 41% and 20% in real terms since 2007. The chart below shows all of the climate change policies that in some way increase energy bills. So people talk about green levies, but there are in fact lots of different things introduced over the past decade and a half. Some cost people money, some save people money and some do both for different groups of people. It wouldn't therefore be easy to repeal all of them at all (many, like the Green Deal are halfway through their operation and would presumably cost more to get rid of it in the short term than it would to keep longer term). Well, the government says that by 2020 the cumulative impact of their measures will save the average household some 11%. The graph below shows all of the policies and how much they will add or take away from a household bill. So with all those things taken together the Department for Energy and Climate Change say that this is what their effect will be on household bills: So far so good, the policies are saving households' money. But if we look at the effect the policy has on retail prices (rather than bills) - how much each household pays for every unit of energy it consumes - we have a very different picture. Impact of levies on Retail Prices (% change from baseline) On that picture households will be paying 41% more for their electricity bills as a result of green policies than the retail price is expected to be. How is that circle squared? Well, it comes down to government's projections that: So although the retail price will be higher as a result of green measures we'll also use less energy thanks to them. Moreover even if we take the initial figure of 11%, nearly half of that actually comes from changes to boiler regulations all the way back in 2002. If those are removed, then the other measures in place save much less - only about 6%. So if the government has got it sums wrong on how much energy insulation will save, householders could find themselves with a rather big headache in the years to come. The impact of green measures is more considerable on business than for householders. Businesses that are medium-sized users of energy currently face energy (gas plus electricity) costs that are on average between 15% and 21% higher as a result of policies. By 2020 the impact is estimated to be between 23% and 26%. Policies are estimated to be adding between 1% and 14% to energy bills for high-energy users in 2013 and between 6% and 37% in 2020. The range depends on their electricity/gas mix. The government has put several measures in place to compensate the most intensive users so as to try to prevent them from becoming uncompetitive in world markets. </body>

      <description>US spying: Pragmatism tempers EU anger</description>

      <body>In the end pragmatism out-pointed outrage. France and Germany have opted to talk with the Americans rather than preside over a rupture in transatlantic relations. That should not disguise a very real sense of betrayal in parts of Europe. Chancellor Angela Merkel was clearly not placated by her phone call with President Obama. His words had been chosen too carefully and it is widely believed in Germany that one of the chancellor's phones had been monitored in the past. "Words will not be sufficient," she said, "true change is necessary". So Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande met at the summit in Brussels and drew up a plan. They are looking to establish a common framework with the United States over intelligence-gathering by the end of the year. They want a new set of rules with a "no spying pact" at the core. This would mirror a similar arrangement the US has had with Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand since just after the World War II. It is unclear, however, where lines would be drawn and how enforceable any pact would be. President Hollande was clear that this was not about weakening ties with America. "What is at stake," he said, "is preserving our relationship with the US. That should not be changed by what happened, but trust has to be restored." There is an underlying reality here: Both Germany and France's intelligence services co-operate with the US closely in monitoring countries like Russia, China and Iran, and neither President Hollande nor Chancellor Merkel wants to change that. The German chancellor was dismissive of suggestions that talks about a free trade deal be postponed until trust between Europe and the US had been restored. She was not prepared to delay a negotiation which promises such rich dividends. Angela Merkel was asked whether she could trust the British and its intelligence agency GCHQ. She sidestepped those questions and spoke about allies serving together in conflict without needing to worry about surveillance. She was also asked whether David Cameron had given assurances that the UK would not spy on its European partners. She implied further discussions were needed, with a view to placing the activities of the intelligence services on a firmer basis. In the end the summit agreed that "intelligence gathering is a vital element in the fight against terrorism". But there was a warning that "a lack of trust could prejudice the necessary co-operation in the field of intelligence-gathering". Spying by its very nature works in the shadows and working out an agreement between Europe and the US will be difficult. In the meantime the reputation of the US in Europe has been damaged by these revelations. </body>

      <title>UK growth fastest for three years</title>
      <description>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show, the fastest growth since 2010.</description>

      <body>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show. The Office for National Statistics said there had been a "fairly strong" performance across all sectors. The data builds on a 0.7% GDP rise in the April-June period and is the best quarterly performance since 2010. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne tweeted: "This shows that Britain's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity." Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the figures "show that we are firmly on the road to economic recovery". The ONS data for construction was up 2.5% over the quarter, the second successive quarter of growth after a volatile performance over the past year. The BBC's chief economics correspondent, Hugh Pym, said: "This could signal that a recovery in that sector is really under way." House-builders have been buoyed by the Government's Help to Buy scheme, which recently launched a new phase offering mortgage guarantees. The ONS said that production grew by 0.5%, though this remains 12.8% off its 2008 level, while within this, manufacturing improved 0.9% in the third quarter. The services sector, which represents three-quarters of economic output, grew by 0.7%. Output from services is now above its pre-crisis peak in the first quarter of 2008. Friday's figure is the first estimate, and could be revised up or down in subsequent months. Mr Osborne told the BBC: "It shows that we are on the path to prosperity. Lots of risks remain, so we have to stick with the economic plan that has got us this far. "What's encouraging about these figures is that it's not just services that are growing. Construction is growing and manufacturing is growing." Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: "After three damaging years of flatlining, it's both welcome and long overdue that our economy is growing again. "But for millions of people across the country still seeing prices rising faster than their wages, this is no recovery at all." Despite the further evidence that recovery is gaining hold, some economists remain cautious. The Institute of Directors' chief economist Graeme Leach said: "The outlook looks better than at any time since the onset of the financial crisis. Indeed, our members have more confidence in the economy than at any time since 2008. "However, strong headwinds remain and the annual growth rate year on year is nothing to get too excited about yet. Though inflationary pressures are likely to remain benign, debt and inflation are rising faster than earnings. "By far the biggest challenges remain on the supply side, not the demand side. Supply side constraints mean that the current growth spurt is unlikely to extend beyond next year. "This stage of our economic recovery is likely to be short and sweet, instead of long and strong." The director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, John Longworth, said: "This is the highest quarterly increase we've seen in three years, so the economy is clearly moving in the right direction. "But we are still behind a number of advanced economies, such as the US and Germany, that have managed to recover the output lost during the economic downturn. "Much more needs to be done to transform our economy from being good to being really great." Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said the figures confirmed the UK was enjoying "a period of healthy and well-balanced growth". He said it was likely that the UK recorded the fastest quarterly growth rate within the G7 countries in the third quarter. But he added that a squeeze on real incomes as wage growth lagged behind inflation, together with the fiscal squeeze and a stagnant eurozone, were likely to prevent recovery gathering much more pace. It echoed remarks by Bank of England governor Mark Carney on Thursday evening, when he said in a speech that the rate of growth was "towards the top end of the advanced economies", but "coming from a very very low base". </body>

      <body>The Grangemouth petrochemical plant near Falkirk is to stay open after a new deal was struck with workers. Staff were told in a mass meeting at 11:00 that the decision to close the site would be reversed. Operator Ineos announced on Wednesday that the plant was to shut, with the loss of 800 jobs, after union members rejected a survival plan. But on Friday, Ineos said it would reopen the plant and the neighbouring oil refinery "with immediate effect". The news was welcomed by the Unite union and political leaders. The company said the move had followed a "dramatic U-turn" by Unite and its "belated recognition" that the company's survival plan was the only way to ensure Grangemouth's long-term future. It added that Unite had agreed to taking no strike action for three years, moving to a "modern" pension scheme and accepting a three-year pay freeze. Ineos also confirmed it would invest a further £300m in the site's long-term future. The company's announcement was greeted by huge cheers from the workforce, who had gathered at the plant to be told of the company's decision. Unite Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said: "Relief will ring right round the Grangemouth community, and across Scotland today. "Hundreds of jobs that would have been lost can now be saved and £300m will be invested into the plant." First Minister Alex Salmond described the announcement as a "tremendous fillip for the workforce and the whole Grangemouth community, following what could have been a potential disaster". He said it had been "a great team effort from all concerned", including the unions and workforce, the management and governments. "I am delighted that people have rallied round to protect these jobs, and now we can all agree that Grangemouth has an outstanding future," he added. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael also welcomed the announcement, saying that it was "the news that we all wanted". "The staff and their families have been through a very stressful and uncertain time," he said. "They have been through a hell of a week and I hope they have a much better weekend as a result of today's announcement." Mr Carmichael added: "They can look to the future with an optimism which was absent earlier in the week." Ineos' future plans include investing a further £300m in the site. Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean said: "It is a huge investment and that investment was only rightly to be done if we had a long-term sustainable base. "What we have now done is given the chemicals business another 15 to 20 years on the back of new raw materials, new contracts and significant investment." Mr MacLean would not dismiss the prospect of redundancies, but said they would be "very limited". He also denied that the company had demanded any additional concessions from the union. The company said the Scottish government had indicated it would support its application for a £9m grant to help finance a gas terminal, while the UK government had given "pre-qualification approval" for a £125m loan guarantee facility. Ineos founder and chairman Jim Ratcliffe said it was "a victory for common sense". He told the BBC that the Grangemouth complex "should have a life for many years to come, as long as we can get this gas terminal built and we can sign up gas contracts and bring gas in from America". The company has indicated that 2,000 contractors it laid off after shutting down the complex would be re-hired to support investment in its survival plan. Falkirk Council, which had planned to set up a task force to respond to the threatened closure, said the Ineos announcement was "the best possible outcome for all concerned". Council leader Craig Martin added: "There has been a tremendous effort behind the scenes to secure the plant's future involving UK and Scottish governments and Falkirk Council, working together to ensure the plant's survival. "This partnership approach has paid off and a more stable and positive future for the workforce has been delivered." The closure move came after workers rejected a deal which would have changed their pay and pensions. Ministers and Unite were involved in top-level talks on Thursday to try to save the site and a fresh offer was made by unions to the company. </body>

      <body>Twitter has unveiled the price range for its shares when the company lists on the stock exchange. In a filing on Thursday, Twitter said it planned to sell 70 million shares priced between $17 and $20 (£10 - £12) to raise up to $1.4bn (£865m). The offering represents 13% of Twitter and values it at as much as $11bn. Analysts said the valuation, which was less than forecast, indicated the firm wanted to avoid the dip in prices that followed Facebook's listing. "They're trying to price this for a very strong IPO, ideally creating the conditions for a solid after-market," said Brian Wieser of the Pivotal Research Group. Facebook's shares were priced initially at $38 per share. The stock soared within hours of its debut to a high of $45 but later slumped. Some analysts had blamed over pricing of the shares as a reason behind the fall. However, Facebook shares have since recouped most of their losses and are now trading above the listing price. Twitter's share sale on the New York Stock Exchange will make it the biggest internet company to go public after Facebook. The microblogging site has seen steady growth since its launch seven years ago. According to its IPO documents, it now has 218 million monthly users and 500 million tweets are sent a day. However, all those users and tweets have not yet resulted in a profit. Twitter made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m. Some analysts said that while the lower-than-expected pricing may help its share prices in the days after the listing, in the long run investors would still need to see the firm make profits. "The fact that the valuation is lower than expectations, I think was smart by the underwriters. I think it will help the pop," said Michael Yoshikami of Destinational Wealth Management. "But in the end, even for $11bn, the question is can they come up with earnings to substantiate that number? And it's unclear that they're going to be able to do that." Almost 85% of Twitter's revenue currently comes from advertising on its site. There are three main ways for a company or an individual to advertise on Twitter: by promoting a tweet that will appear in people's timelines, promoting a whole account, or promoting a trend. Twitter tends to charge its advertisers according to the amount of interaction their content generates. Some analysts say the company has showing strong signs of growth, with revenue rising from just $28m in 2010 to $317m by the end of 2012. One research firm, eMarketer, has even estimated that Twitter's revenues from advertising sales will increase by more than 100% by the end of this year. </body>

      <title>Serco chief executive stands down</title>
      <description>The boss of security firm Serco resigns after accusations of overcharging the government tens of millions of pounds for electronic tags for criminals.</description>

      <body>The chief executive at Serco, a security firm at the centre of an overcharging scandal, has resigned. Outgoing boss Chris Hyman said the best way for the company to move forward "is for me to step back". Serco is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) after claims it had overcharged the government by "tens of millions" of pounds for electronic tags for criminals. The government welcomed the news, describing it as a "positive move". In July, Justice Secretary Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said an audit had revealed a "significant anomaly in the billing practices" of both Serco and G4S. Mr Grayling said that since 2005, the companies had in some cases been charging for tagging offenders who were in prison, had left the country or were even dead. In September, the government handed information to the SFO for their assessment. On Friday, Serco announced plans to reorganise the company. The firm said it would split the government work into a separate business that could be more closely monitored. A government statement said it would "take full account of all the changes Serco have made today". "Whilst it is early days in their programme of renewal, this is a positive move by Serco and a step forward." The statement added that its review of government contracts, announced in July by the Justice Secretary, was continuing and would "ensure government's contractual arrangements are robust and taxpayers' money is spent responsibly, in a vibrant, competitive market for public services". Shares in Serco were up 2.8% after the news. Mr Hyman said he had "always put the interests of Serco first", adding that it was important the relationship with the government was rebuilt. He said: "I have been fortunate enough to have had the privilege of working at a great company with extremely talented people. I wish everyone at Serco the very best for the future." No new contracts are being awarded to either of the firms until the audit is completed, the government said in September. The head of G4S, Richard Morris, stepped down on Thursday. </body>

      <title>Mortgage competition picking up</title>
      <description>The Nationwide has cut some mortgage rates for those unable to raise a large deposit, but it remains undecided on whether to join the Help to Buy scheme.</description>

      <body>The Nationwide has cut some mortgage rates for those unable to raise a large deposit, but it remains undecided on whether to join the Help to Buy scheme. The UK's largest building society said fixed rate deals for those offering a deposit of 10% of a home's value would be cut by 0.3 percentage points. The aim is to challenge some lenders who have signed up to the government's extended Help to Buy scheme. But Nationwide itself remains uncommitted on whether to join. The government's initiative is designed to allow those who can make the repayments but can afford only small deposits to buy a home. The first phase of the Help to Buy scheme in England started in April, when buyers of newly built homes were eligible for a 20% equity loan from the government on top of their 5% deposit. Similar schemes are operating in Scotland and Wales. Under the second phase, buyers across the UK only need to provide a small deposit, with the government offering a guarantee of 15% of the loan to the lender - for a fee - to encourage the bank or building society to offer the loan. The launch of the second stage prompted some lenders to bring out new mortgage products for first-time buyers. "The Help to Buy scheme has really prompted the lenders into offering better first-time buyer mortgages and lower deposit rates are still getting more competitively priced," said Aaron Strutt, of Trinity Financial mortgage brokers. "First-time buyers in general are accessing better mortgages and this is partly due to the increase in competition Help to Buy has generated." A host of big mortgage lenders have also said they would offer products when the scheme officially starts in January - but Nationwide is yet to be one of them. "No decision has been reached. Nationwide is continuing to support lending to those with smaller deposits and we are already very active in the high loan-to-value sector of the mortgage market," a Nationwide spokeswoman said. The building society's new rate for a two-year fixed rate deal for a buyer offering a 10% deposit is 3.99%, with a £900 fee, or a £400 fee for first-time buyers. A number of lenders offer mortgages at this loan-to-value level. </body>

      <title>East Coast rail sale gets under way</title>
      <description>Re-privatising the East Coast Main line will "revitalise" it, ministers say as they kick-start the franchising process, but Labour and unions attack the move.</description>

      <body>Returning the East Coast Main line to the private sector will "revitalise" it, ministers have said as they kick-started the franchising process. The line has been publicly run since 2009 when National Express handed back the franchise amid financial problems. Ministers say the line has since been "stabilised" but they now want to "rekindle the spirit of competition". Labour and the unions say the move is "ideological" and the line should remain in public ownership. They say the failure of two successive operators to make the line - which runs from London to Edinburgh, with connected services to Inverness and Aberdeen - commercially viable and its improved performance in recent years show it can succeed under public ownership. The government began the franchising process on Friday by releasing information about the line's financial position as well as the basic criteria for interested parties and details of the commercial risks involved. The successful bidder is due to be announced in a year's time with its franchise starting in February 2015. Among those reported to be interested in bidding is Eurostar, which runs services from London to the Continent. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said public ownership was never meant to be a permanent arrangement and returning the operation of the line to the private sector would bring more investment and innovation. "We want to see a revitalised East Coast railway, one that both rekindles the spirit of competition for customers on this great route and competes with the West Coast on speed, quality and customer service," he said. Rail minister Stephen Hammond told the BBC that the East Coast "lagged behind" other long-distance operators in terms of punctuality while customer satisfaction was only "in line" with other routes. "While they have done a good job, there is a lot more that can be done," he said, adding that the doubling of rail passengers since privatisation in the 1990s showed the benefits of the franchise process. Critics of privatisation say the East Coast line has returned £800m to the taxpayer under public ownership. But Mr Hammond said this was not a fair comparison as Network Rail had reduced charges for using the track substantially since National Express relinquished the franchise. The government says it is already planning "significant" investment in the line over the next six years, including new rolling stock, upgrades to the track around Peterborough and the rebuilding of Doncaster station. But it wants a private sector operator to "transform the customer experience", develop "innovative timetables" and identify further opportunities for improving stations along the 353-mile route. But Labour said the privatisation process - which was expected to be delayed until after the next election - was being driven by ideological reasons rather than the interests of passengers. The opposition say the government has "learnt nothing" from the debacle over the West Coast Main Line franchising process last year, which had to be abandoned after mistakes by civil servants led to flawed calculations. Speaking to the Financial Times, shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said Labour's review of rail policy next year would consider the case for re-nationalisation among other options. "We want a model that is going to work. What is interesting is that we have foreign state-owned railways running our services and investing money back into their own networks. "If it works as a model for them, why can't it work as a model for the UK?" The RMT union has pledged to fight the re-privatisation, saying the government is playing down the success of the line under public ownership in order to "bulldoze" the sale through. Earlier this month it claimed a leaked version of the draft sale brochure redacted sections highlighting the good punctuality and performance of the service under public ownership. "It is simply outrageous that the government are firing the starting gun on the re-privatisation of the East Coast when every objective analysis shows that this is a successful and reliable service," RMT boss Bob Crow said. And the TUC said the line needed an operator which would put passengers not shareholders first. "The government doesn't have one good argument for re-privatising the line and is yet again being blinded by outdated market dogma," said general secretary Frances O'Grady. "As with the Royal Mail, they are putting ideology before evidence in the desire to sell off yet another important state asset." </body>

      <body>David Cameron has won the backing of EU chief Jose Manuel Barroso for his push to limit the number of new regulations coming out of Brussels. The two chaired a meeting of EU leaders on the issue at Friday's summit. The prime minister has said firms are being "throttled" by red tape and for every regulation and directive introduced another should be removed. Mr Barroso said more needed to be done to ensure "lighter, simpler, cheaper, common-sense regulation". The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, has said it has already cut 5,590 regulations since 2005. Mr Cameron is committed to renegotiating the UK's relationship with the EU if the Conservative Party wins the next election, ahead of an "in-out" referendum on whether the country should remain a member. In the meantime, he is promising to work to reduce the bureaucracy facing companies. Conservative sources say he wants to see 1,500 regulations reviewed. Eighty business leaders, including the chairmen of BT and Asda, have signed a letter calling for a "strong commitment" by the government towards this and several have accompanied Mr Cameron to Brussels to make the case. The prime minister has made the issue the central objective of the two-day European Council meeting. He held one-to-one meetings with the leaders of Germany and the Netherlands, who share similar views on deregulation, and co-chaired a meeting with the leaders of Poland, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy and Estonia, who are also sympathetic. "The Commission has done an excellent job in lifting the burden of bureaucracy. Now I want to get business engaged," he said, adding that a faster pace of deregulation was essential to getting firms to "compete and succeed". Mr Barroso, the Commission's president, said he appreciated that businesses needed a single set of rules, rather than 28 different bodies of national regulation, for the single market to work and for the important digital economy to continue to grow. Acknowledging that "useless laws weaken necessary laws", he said there were other areas where it was necessary to cut bureaucracy without reducing standards of consumer protection, health and safety and environmental concerns. "That is why we have to slash red tape," he said. </body>

      <title>Gucci owner sees share price fall</title>

      <body>Shares in French luxury and retail firm Kering have dropped by 3.6% after its Gucci fashion brand posted its weakest quarterly sales growth for four years. Gucci's sales growth fell to 0.6% in the third quarter. Analysts had expected 1%. As a whole, Kering's luxury division posted a sales rise of 5.6%, as against expectations of up to 8%. Gucci makes up more than half of Kering, whose share price fell to 169 euros (£144) following the results. Citi analysts attributed Gucci's weaker performance to "self-inflicted disruption" as it attempted to take itself further upmarket. Jean-Marc Duplaix, finance director at Kering, said the weaker growth in Gucci sales was due to a temporary decline in demand for luxury products. He said that changes made by the company in order to restore control over the brand and increase exclusivity, by limiting distributors and volumes of product, were also behind the slowdown. Kering also owns Puma, Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen. Earlier this month, the world's biggest luxury goods group, LVMH, also reported slowing sales at its most important division, Louis Vuitton, which accounts for more than half of the group's operating profits. </body>

      <body>Samsung Electronics has reported a 26% jump in profit in the third quarter driven by strong smartphone sales and a recovery in its memory chip business. It made a net profit of 8.24 trillion won ($7.6bn; £4.7bn) in the July-to-September quarter, up from 6.56tn won during the same period a year earlier. Operating profit rose to a record 10.2 trillion won during the quarter. The firm said sales of smartphones, a key driver of its growth, are expected to rise further in coming months. It said that sales "will gain momentum due to year-end promotions over the holiday season and an improved line-up of mass-market smartphones". Samsung has posted record operating profit in six of the past seven quarters, mostly due to the growth of its smartphone division. The firm has enjoyed success in both the top-end as well as lower end of the smartphone market, giving it an edge over rivals such as Apple which makes only top-end phones. Its growth in the sector has seen it become the world's biggest smartphone maker. However, there have been concerns over whether Samsung can continue to grow at such a strong pace, not least because of increased competition and saturation of some key markets. "Samsung has done well, having rapidly caught up with Apple in the smartphone market. But I'm concerned whether Samsung would be able to do better," said Kim Sung-soo, a fund manager at LS Asset Management. "Like Nokia, Samsung may hit a limit in increasing market share. Apple is also fighting back, signalling an uphill battle for Samsung." Analysts said that the company needed to come up with more innovative products to help sustain its growth rate. For its part, Samsung has been taking steps in that direction. Earlier this month, it launched a smartphone with a curved display screen, beating its rival LG by at least a few months to offer a handset featuring flexible-screen tech. In September, it unveiled a smartwatch with a colour screen that can show alerts, be used for voice calls and run apps. Again, it edged firms such as Microsoft, Apple and Google to unveil such a device. Samsung's latest earnings were also boosted by its semiconductor business, which saw profit more than double to 2.1tn won, the highest in three years. Revenues in the division rose 12% over the previous quarter to 9.74tn won. The firm saw its bottom line buoyed by stronger chip prices after a fire at a plant owned by rival SK Hynix caused tightened supply in the market. Samsung supplies chips to other smartphone-makers, including its biggest competitor Apple, and expects demand to pick up as the year draws to a close. However, its consumer electronics division, which includes TV manufacturing, saw a decline in profit due to a drop in demand in China and Europe. But Samsung said that it expects the unit to bounce back in the current quarter, not least due to holiday season shopping during the end of the year. </body>

      <title>Women gain as gender gap 'narrows'</title>
      <description>The gender gap is narrowing across the world, a World Economic Forum report suggests, with Nordic countries leading the way but Arab nations lagging behind.</description>

      <body>The gap between men and women has narrowed slightly in the past year in most countries, according to a World Economic Forum (WEF) report. Iceland, Finland and Norway top the list of 136 nations, based on political participation, economic equality and rights like education and health. The Middle East and North Africa were the only regions not to improve in the past year, with Yemen at the bottom. The Philippines and Nicaragua both feature in the top 10. The WEF has produced the report annually for the past eight years. The release of this year's edition comes as the BBC rounds off a month-long focus on women and gender around the world with a major event at Broadcasting House in London. One hundred women from all around the world are gathering for a day of debate and discussion as the 100 Women season comes to an end. Iceland's position at the top of the WEF rankings was the fifth year in a row the country has been named the world's most equal. Report founder and co-author Saadia Zahidi told the BBC that since the WEF began compiling the index in 2006, 80% of countries had made progress. "What's worrying though is that 20% of countries have made no progress or are falling behind," she said. She singled out the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia as countries that had invested in education and health, but had not integrated women into the economy. Nadia al-Sakkaf, editor of the English-language Yemen Times, in London for the 100 Women conference, told the BBC that she had stopped counting the years her country had languished at the bottom of the equality list. "It comes down to everyday life. We had three women running for president in 2006. We have lots of women in senior positions," she said. "But our levels of maternal mortality are very high, and 35% of girls aged 6-14 years old are not in school." Human capital Saadia Zahidi of the WEF said that by contrast many sub-Saharan countries had not invested in women, but through necessity they played a major role in the economy. Nordic countries continued to lead the way because they had a long history of investing in people, she said. "They are small economies with small populations; they recognise that talent matters, and that talent has to be men and women. Overall, the report, entitled Global Gender Gap Report 2013, found Iceland to be the most advanced country in the world in terms of gender equality for the fifth year running. Iceland, Finland (second), Norway (third) and Sweden (fourth) had all closed over 80% of the gender gap, where 100% would represent full equality. The highest-ranked Asian nation was the Philippines (fifth), praised for its success in health, education and economic participation. Asia's major economies performed poorly, with China in 69th place and Japan 105th. Nicaragua in 10th place was the highest positioned country in North and South America, and was praised for a "strong performance" in terms of political empowerment. Among major world economies Germany ranked 14th (down one), the UK held its position at 18, with Canada at 20 and the United States 23rd. On matters of health and survival, the report finds that 96% of the gap has now closed. In terms of education, the global gender gap is 93% closed, with 25 countries now judged to deliver equal treatment to boys and girls at school. It is a different picture on the core issue of economic equality, where the gender gap has closed by 60%. In developing and developed countries alike, women's presence in economic leadership positions is limited. And while women have made small gains in political representation - 2% this year - only 21% of that global gender gap has closed Ms Zahidi said the idea of the report was not to remind poor countries that they had fewer opportunities than rich countries, but to give them a tool to improve the situation. "Women make up one half of the human capital available to any economy and any company; if that talent isn't integrated, that is going to be a loss for both women and men," she said. </body>

      <title>Salmond 'certain' on Ineos deal</title>
      <description>First Minister Alex Salmond says he is "absolutely certain" that the petrochemical plant at Grangemouth can be saved.</description>

      <body>First Minister Alex Salmond has said he is "absolutely certain" that the petrochemical plant at Grangemouth can be saved. Staff are waiting to hear if owner Ineos will grant a reprieve to the closure-threatened operation. About 800 jobs are under threat - and the company has already laid off about 2,000 contractors since it shut down the complex. Ineos will update the staff on its plans at a meeting at 11:00. Speaking on the BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Salmond said: "I would now be very hopeful indeed that there will be a change in position from Ineos and I'm absolutely certain there's a future for chemicals in Grangemouth. "I believe there will be a change in position today and that will be a favourable change in position. "My reason for saying that is that everybody has been going that extra mile I called for. "Given that only 48 hours ago we were looking at a major industrial catastrophe in Scotland, I think we're in a much better position this Friday morning." Mr Salmond said the trade unions had offered that there would be no industrial action for three years. "That's an indication that however we got to this impasse two days ago, there has now been substantial movement of people anxious to save their jobs, their livelihoods and their plants," he told the programme. Political leaders had already expressed optimism after the union accepted a survival plan put forward by Ineos. The BBC understands that an agreement was being drawn up for workers to sign, which would need approval from major Ineos shareholder Jim Ratcliffe. On Thursday, Scotland's finance secretary John Swinney and the Scottish Secretary Alastair Carmichael held talks with unions and management at the site. Afterwards they said they were hopeful. However, Ineos is yet to confirm whether it will reverse its decision to close the petrochemical plant at the complex. An internal investigation by Ineos into the union convenor, Stephen Deans, is also due to be published later. It was the firm's treatment of Mr Deans that first ignited the breakdown in industrial relations - before it became a battle for the survival of Scotland's largest industrial site. The dispute at the site escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but Ineos shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a survival plan, which was initially rejected by union members. The proposals included ending their final salary pension scheme and cut shift allowances. Previously, Ineos said it was ready to invest £300m in Grangemouth if workers agreed to the new terms and conditions. The company said it had decided to close the plant because half the workforce had refused to accept the cost-cutting plan essential for the facility's survival. Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the neighbouring refinery would go as well. The refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. Ineos had said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week. </body>

      <body>Oxfam is set to cut 125 posts in the UK and close several of its regional offices to make it more "efficient", the charity has said. Its headquarters in Oxford will be most affected, with 110 jobs being axed. The charity is also expected to concentrate its work on fewer countries. Mark Goldring, Oxfam CEO, said: "It is imperative that we have an Oxfam which lives within its means and is relevant to 21st century needs." Several departments will be reduced, including human resources, finance, business support, and campaigns and policy. The changes reflect a shift in the organisation's priorities, it said. They would also "balance its budget and, in due course, provide additional funds to invest in programmes". Resources are to be focused on poorer countries, including promoting poor women's rights. Mr Goldring said: "Advances in technology mean we no longer need as much support in head office. "Instead, our resources will be focused in the regions where we carry out the majority of our work. "This will mean we can deliver the most effective and efficient support to the millions of people who go to sleep hungry each night." Jane Cotton, Oxfam's human resources director, said: "This is the start of a consultation process with staff. "We will make every effort to keep the number of redundancies to a minimum and where possible we will redeploy people and help colleagues find work elsewhere if this is not practical." Further changes will be made to Oxfam's international programme, starting in 2015. Its income fell £17.6m to £367.9m in the year to 31 March, with its two main sources of money, shops and fundraising, down on the previous year. The charity's annual report showed its shops' net income fell 9.9% to £20.1m, while fundraising fell 5.6% to £267.8m. It blamed the fall on tough economic times, and said many shops had reported a decline in donations. Problems in Syria, Yemen and West Africa had also stretched its resources, Mr Goldring said. Oxfam GB employs 5,300 people across the world and has more than 22,000 volunteers. </body>

      <body>Truckmaker Volvo is cutting 2,000 jobs after investments in new models and a rising Swedish kronor held back third-quarter profits. Sweden's largest private sector employer said earnings fell to 2.50bn kronor ($393m; £242m) from 3.48bn kronor a year-ago. Volvo is launching a new range of trucks ahead of emissions rule changes. "The changeover to the new products will take another couple of quarters," chief executive Olof Persson said. Volvo, which makes trucks under the Renault, Mack and UD brands, said third-quarter sales fell to 64.9bn kronor, down 5% on the same quarter last year. European demand for commercial vehicles has been held back by an 18-month recession that ended in the second quarter of this year. Sales in the heavy-truck segment in Europe fell 8.1% in the eight months to the end of August, according to industry data. Mr Persson said in a statement: "The product renewal is the largest in the history of the Volvo Group, and it means that we are going to enter 2014 with a highly competitive product range." Shares in Volvo, which employs about 120,000 people, were 7% down in early morning trading. </body>

      <body>Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, saw its losses narrow in the third quarter as its sales grew more than expected. It reported a net loss of $41m (£25m) for the July-September period. That is down from $274m a year earlier. The firm said that its sales surged 24% from a year ago to $17.1bn. The firm forecast its sales would grow further in the current quarter. That saw its shares rise by as much as 9.6% in after-hours trading in New York. RJ Jottovy, an analyst with Morningstar, said that "it looks like the revenue momentum will continue into the fourth quarter" despite the macro business environment being tough. Amazon said it expects fourth-quarter sales of $23.5bn to $26.5bn. Analysts had forecast revenue of $25.9bn. This is the third quarter in a row that Amazon has posted a net loss. However, the firm has been taking steps to try to turn around its fortunes. This includes expanding its Kindle line of e-readers and tablets and boosting its delivery network and cloud-computing services. The company has also been building more warehouses to reduce shipping costs and is adding robots to increase its efficiency in delivering orders. Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, said in a statement that ''it's been a busy few months" for the company. At the same time some of the services being offered by the firm have also helped to attract consumers. Mr Bezos added that one Amazon service called Prime had signed up "millions" of new members. The service offers free two-day shipping for eligible purchases. Members also get access to Amazon Instant Video and have the ability to borrow books from other Kindle owners. </body>

      <body>Microsoft reported better than expected earnings of $5.2bn (£3.2bn). Profits at the technology giant were up 17% from the same period last year. "Our devices and services transformation is progressing," said boss Steve Ballmer in a statement. He added that Microsoft is launching a "wide range" of new products in the coming quarter. The report shed no light on who is to replace Mr Ballmer, who announced plans to retire within the next year. The company has released several new products this quarter, including an update to Windows 8, and recently bought the mobile phone unit of struggling Finnish giant Nokia. Shares rose 6% in after hours trading on the strong results. For the first time, Microsoft also announced sales of its tablet computer, Surface. It said revenues from Surface "grew to $400 million with sequential growth in revenue and units sold over the prior quarter". Last quarter, the company was forced to take an embarrassing write down of $900m after sluggish sales. The computer, well-liked by reviewers, marked Microsoft's first foray into hardware manufacturing. However consumers, many of whom expressed displeasure at Microsoft's update to its popular operating system Windows, did not bite. The company still did not provide sales figures of the device. Investors hoping for any information about who will replace Mr Ballmer in the new year were disappointed. Earlier today, on a conference call to discuss earnings, Ford boss Alan Mullaly declined to comment on rumours that he was being considered for the top job. Other contenders include Stephen Elop, the former head of Nokia, who resigned as boss after Microsoft announced it would purchase the Nokia's mobile phone unit for 5.4bn euros ($7.2bn; £4.6bn) in September. Mr Elop is now head of Devices and Services at Nokia, although he is expected to transfer to Microsoft - where he was once a top manager - once the deal is completed. Mr Ballmer has been at the helm of Microsoft since 2000, and has been at the company since 1980. </body>

      <body>The Bank of England intends to boost the availability of finance for banks, a move which could help them lend to consumers. Describing the bank as "open for business", he said it would offer money for longer periods and widen the range of assets accepted as collateral. He justified the move by saying that banks were healthier and had to meet tougher standards. He also said there were reasons to believe the recovery was sustainable. "One of the reasons to think there could be some sustainability, some traction in the recovery is that the core of the financial system has gotten a lot better," he said. "I won't say it's fully healed, but it's gotten a lot better and the rebuilding of [bank] capital is a big element of that." He accepted that the reputation of the banking system had been damaged over the last few years. He said that when he visited the UK as governor of the Bank of Canada during the crisis, he was struck how different the attitude was towards the banking sector. He said that "loathing" of the banking sector had replaced confidence. Mr Carney was speaking at a gathering marking the 125th anniversary of the Financial Times newspaper. He said he hoped that banks would take advantage of the new opportunities to borrow from the Bank of England, as those facilities were little used at the moment. The idea is to smooth bank finances and avoid a credit crunch, in which banks are unwilling to loan money to consumers or business. </body>

      <title>Greenland allows huge iron ore mine</title>
      <description>Greenland gives UK-based London Mining a 30-year licence to build and operate an iron ore mine, employing up to 3,000 mainly Chinese workers.</description>

      <body>Greenland has awarded UK-based company London Mining a 30-year licence to build and run a giant iron ore mine. Greenland's industry minister called it the largest commercial project in the autonomous Danish territory's history. London Mining is expected to seek investment partners for the multi-billion dollar project. Some opponents say the open-cast mine will cause environmental damage; others are concerned about plans to bring in up to 3,000 mainly Chinese workers. The iron ore deposit is located 150km (about 90 miles) from Nuuk, the capital of Greenland. In a statement on its website, London Mining said the mine was expected to produce 15m tonnes a year of "very high quality iron ore concentrate to the global steel industry". It said the ore concentrate could be shipped year round from a dedicated deep water port. The Greenland government hopes the mine will boost the economy, which is largely dependent on fishing and subsidies from Denmark. "This is indeed a historic moment for Greenland," said Industry and Minerals Minister Jens-Erik Kirkegaard. He said "the largest commercial project to date in Greenland" would boost employment and state revenues - in line with a pledge made by the governing Social Democrats to draw foreign companies to help tap Greenland's resources. The project, known as Isua, is expected to bring in 3,000 workers to Greenland, which has a population of about 56,000, to help build and operate the mine and related infrastructure. London Mining, in a report from June 2010, said it had "identified significant economies of scale, and the involvement of Chinese construction groups is anticipated to deliver significant cost savings". Environmentalists say they want reassurances that the exploitation of the deposits will not come at the cost of extensive environmental damage. "I really hope that the Greenland government has sold itself at a high price, so that London Mining lives up to far stricter requirements than they originally would have done," said Gitte Seeberg, the secretary general of WWF Denmark. She said the Greenland government should insist that the mine be powered by hydroelectric power rather than diesel, and that there should be safeguards to deal with problems such as the dramatic increase in traffic. </body>

      <body>Actor Robert De Niro is among the investors in a new property complex in the Chinese city of Shanghai, to include an arts centre, a boutique hotel, a cinema and global retailers. Due to open in 2016, Project 179 will be a 76,500-sq-m (850,000-sq-ft) complex on Shanghai's waterfront. De Niro signed a deal with the property's owner, the Shanghai Bund Investment group, as part of a US-Chinese business partnership. The design will reflect 1920s Shanghai. De Niro said: "By ensuring a design that reflects the vibrant history of Shanghai, Project 179 can serve as a jewel in its crown: ushering in a bright future while paying homage to its rich and storied past." The star of films including Goodfellas and Taxi Driver said he was looking forward to establishing the Bund district, on Shanghai's waterfront, as "one of the premier visitor destinations across the globe". The project will restore four vacant buildings and build a fifth, and is named after the municipally-designated blocks of land it is built on. </body>

      <body>Supermarket chain Sainsbury's has apologised after a worker told a new mother she "shouldn't be out of the house with a baby this young". Sabina Latto said she was approached by the female employee in a store in Hedge End, Hampshire, with questions about her six-week-old son, Myles. But the conversation turned and she was later asked: "Where's the father?" She complained while in the store and the worker apologised. Sainsbury's said it was investigating. Mrs Latto said it was one of the few times she had taken Myles out of the house since he was born. "I was approached by a member of staff, and when you have a new baby lots of people approach you and usually it's very kind things like 'oh isn't he gorgeous', and initially that's how the conversation started," she told BBC News. "Unfortunately it took a very sudden turn when she decided to tell me that, basically, I shouldn't be out of the house with a baby this young. "She asked me what I was thinking 'bringing my son to a place like this'. "It left me completely shocked, I was almost speechless." The new mother said other shoppers stepped in to defend her but the remarks continued during the incident on Wednesday. "Then she went on to ask me where my son's father was," Mrs Latto added. "[It] made it seem like I wasn't looking after him properly and that I was neglecting him when all I was doing was having a look round the shops." She made a complaint and was taken for a chat in the store's cafe where the employee later made an apology. In a statement, Sainsbury's said: "We are deeply concerned by this incident and apologise unreservedly to Mrs Latto for the distress this has caused her. "We are investigating what happened and the store manager would like to meet Mrs Latto to apologise in person." </body>

      <title>New fears over university pensions</title>
      <description>A massive shortfall in a pensions scheme used by UK university staff is even worse than thought, analysis for BBC Newsnight suggests.</description>

      <body>A massive shortfall in a pensions scheme used by UK university staff is even worse than thought, analysis for the BBC's Newsnight has suggested. In its status report this month the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) put its fund deficit at £7.9bn. But the analysis methods that private companies use put it at £10.5bn. There are concerns that such a significant hole in what is the biggest pension fund in the country could lead to a rise in tuition fees for students. The Universities Superannuation Scheme, with 303,000 members, has assets of £37.9bn - more than three times what taxpayers spend every year on higher education. By its own official estimate to members this month, that is £7.9bn short of what it needs to pay pensions. Those numbers are disputed by the fund's critics who say that working it out on the formula private companies use - known as FRS17 - would put it at £2.6bn higher. Analysis for Newsnight by pensions consultant John Ralfe, former finance director of Boots, showed that to make good that deficit over 20 years would require a nearly doubling of contributions to £1.8bn. That equates to a rise in tuition fees of up to £1,000 a year. Mr Ralfe said: "There is a whole degree of denial. USS is in denial about its real financial situation. Universities are in denial. "We have seen private member schemes closing to new members and existing members wholesale over the last few years. "There will be repercussions for the university sector. All we're doing is bequeathing a very real problem to our children." Higher Education Minister David Willetts told Newsnight it would be wrong to pass on the cost of higher pensions to students. "Universities are independent autonomous bodies and they know one of their financial responsibilities is to stand behind their pensions and tackle their deficits," he said. "It would be wrong to expect students to bail out pension deficits to support pension schemes that are far more generous than students are likely to enjoy when they're older." Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the umbrella body Universities UK, said there was no question that tuition fees would be used to address the pension fund shortfall. "Employers have already taken significant steps to address the fund deficit and will continue to work on long term solutions to ensure that USS remains sustainable and affordable. "The range of challenges facing the fund are not exclusive to USS and impact on all pension schemes. "There is no suggestion that tuition fees will be increased to plug the USS funding shortfalls. This will not feature in any of the considered options to deal with this deficit." Prof Craig Calhoun, director of the London School of Economics, said the size of the scheme's black hole concerned him. "It's very worrying now and it looks even more worrying for the future," he said. "It would be an added cost that we would have to cover either from tuition fees or some other source, either philanthropy or earnings from consulting or other enterprises." Bill Galvin, chief executive of USS, told the Newsnight programme that higher contributions or cuts to benefits had to be considered. He said: "It's been done in 2008. It's been done in 2011. We're looking at it again now." The likelihood of higher tuition fees runs alongside the prospect of university staff having to pay more for their pensions. Under a landmark agreement with universities, university staff have to share any large increases in costs with their employers. They are already in militant mood, with strikes planned next week over pay. </body>

      <title>Firefighters to stage more strikes</title>

      <body>Firefighters in England and Wales are to stage two more strikes in the run-up to bonfire night in a row over pensions, the Fire Brigades Union says. The government wants firefighters to work up to 60 but the union says this is too old to be fighting fires. FBU members are due to walk out on 1 November from 18:30 to 23:00 GMT and on 4 November from 06:00 to 08:00 GMT. In the first round of action last month, 32,000 union members in England and Wales walked out, the FBU said. A second strike was called off earlier this month after progress was made during talks. The FBU postponed the five-hour strike saying that the government and fire employers had shifted their position and recognised that firefighters faced losing their jobs and a "large chunk" of their pensions under new changes imposed in April. However, the FBU now says the government and fire employers have failed to offer any firm guarantees on jobs or pensions. FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said: "The Westminster government has created this mess, but it is refusing to clear it up. "It now recognises the problem but it won't provide the legal and financial guarantees firefighters need to ensure they have a job and an unreduced pension in the future. "Firefighters face the sack towards the end of their career and the loss of their pension. That can't be right. "The employers promised to tackle the issue of firefighters facing the sack for failing fitness tests last week, only to say they can't offer any guarantees this week. "That is simply not the way to run a public service. "The government is now making threats to withdraw some of the other concessions they have made this year." London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson said it was prepared to deal with further strikes and would have 27 fire engines based at strategic points across the capital. "The evening strike date falls on the Friday before bonfire night. It is just before Diwali and coincides with half-term, so people need to be really careful with fireworks and bonfires," he said. During the first strike on 25 September, contingency plans at the 46 fire services in England and three in Wales included using part-time and volunteer firefighters, calling in non-union fire crews and bringing in private contractors. The armed forces had a back-up role and in the event of a major incident, union members could have returned to work. No major incidents were reported during the four-hour strike which was the first national walkout for a decade. </body>

      <title>Scottish Power raises prices by 8.6%</title>
      <description>Scottish Power has announced a price rise of 8.6% on dual-fuel energy bills in the same week as being hit by a penalty for its sales tactics.</description>

      <body>Scottish Power has announced a price rise of 8.6% for dual-fuel energy bills from 6 December. The company said it would increase gas prices by 8.5% and electricity prices by 9%. The move comes amid political wrangling over the issue of energy bills, with the government planning to review the green levies that form part of a bill. On Monday, Scottish Power was hit by an £8.5m penalty for misleading doorstep and telephone sales. The price rise would lead to a £113 increase in the average annual dual-fuel bill to £1,424, Scottish Power said. It will affect about 2.2 million Scottish Power customers. However, different areas of the country will face different price increases. For example, the rise will be 10.2% on average in southern England, but 7.3% in some areas of Scotland. Scottish Power is the fourth of the six major energy suppliers to announce price rises. SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills from 15 November, British Gas said prices for its customers would go up by 9.2% on 23 November, and Npower announced the biggest rise of 10.4% which will take effect from 1 December. Scottish Power echoed the views of other suppliers by suggesting that the price rises were the result of the rising wholesale cost of energy. The cost of delivering energy to people's homes, and the rising cost of the government's environmental and social schemes were also to blame, it said. Neil Clitheroe, chief executive of energy retail and generation for Scottish Power, said that there were a number of costs - such as windfarm payments - that did not exist 10 years ago, but which affected bills. "With an increase in costs for delivering compulsory schemes to reduce carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency in homes, we unfortunately have no other option than to pass these on by increasing our prices for customers," he said. "We understand that these are difficult times for many families, and we have done what we can to hold our prices for as long as possible. Recently we announced a range of measures to help our most vulnerable customers this winter. "We will now write to every customer who will be impacted by the price increase, and we would encourage anyone who is concerned to contact us so we can discuss their options." Ann Robinson, of price comparison website Uswitch.com, which would benefit from people switching supplier, said: "Unfortunately, the floodgates have opened and it looks like consumers are going to be buffeted by suppliers in very quick succession." Iberdrola, the Spanish parent group of Scottish Power, said that its UK operations had been affected by tight margins, as well as by energy efficiency and environmental measures imposed by the regulator. "As a consequence, generation and supply is now loss-making, and leaves the company no option but to increase tariffs," it said. There has been considerable political debate over the price rises. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election and has been on the attack over the issue. Subsequently, Prime Minister David Cameron said that there would be a review of the green levies charged to companies that are included in bills. He said this accounted for £113 on an average bill - the same amount as Scottish Power's subsequent price rise announcement. The review will be followed by a competition test for the energy market to establish how it is functioning. The Liberal Democrats called the idea a "panicky U-turn" by Mr Cameron, although Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg later said some of the environmental policies could be delivered in a more cost-effective way. On Tuesday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. On Tuesday, energy firm bosses will give evidence to a committee of MPs about the price rises. Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies introduced price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. Earlier this week, the regulator, Ofgem, said that Scottish Power customers were misled during sales approaches due to the firm's failure to "adequately train and monitor" staff. The company apologised for the errors between 2009 and 2012, and has set up a £1m compensation fund for customers who believe they were victims of mis-selling. It said it would also pay £7.5m to the 140,000 customers it has on the government-led "warm home discount scheme" aimed at supporting customers who are likely to be at risk of fuel poverty, as part of the penalty. </body>

      <title>Eurozone business growth slows</title>
      <description>The pace of growth among eurozone businesses eased in October as the service sector slowed, a business survey indicates.</description>

      <body>The pace of growth among businesses in the eurozone eased in October as the service sector slowed, a survey has indicated. The preliminary Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) from research firm Markit fell to 51.5 from 52.2 in September. However, a reading above 50 still implies expansion, and activity has now grown for four months in a row. Markit said expansion was "broad-based" across the eurozone, although growth slowed in both Germany and France. Germany - which has been the main economic powerhouse for the eurozone in recent years - saw growth slow to a three-month low. Markit also noted that the eurozone's jobs market remained weak. Employment fell for the 22nd month in a row, with the rate of job losses picking up from September. "The survey data have been running in positive territory for four consecutive months now and indicate that the eurozone economy expanded at a quarterly rate of 0.2% at the start of the fourth quarter, suggesting an ongoing, albeit sluggish, recovery," said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. Spain's economy - which was one of the hardest hit by the credit crunch and subsequent economic downturn - has shown signs this week that it is slowly starting to recover. Official figures show the country's unemployment rate - which is one of the highest in Europe - fell slightly in the third quarter of this year, to 26% from 26.3% in the previous quarter. On Wednesday, the Bank of Spain said the country's economy had emerged from recession after growing for the first time in more than two years. The bank estimated that Spain's economy grew by 0.1% between July and September. The eurozone emerged from recession in the second quarter of this year when it grew by 0.3% following a record 18 months of economic contraction. However, earlier this month, European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi said the recovery in the bloc remained "weak, fragile, uneven". He said further support for the banking sector could not be ruled out, and that the ECB was "ready to consider all available instruments" to maintain financial stability and ensure that recovery in the eurozone took hold. There has been speculation that the ECB might offer another round of cheap, long-term loans to banks to keep the cost of credit down. </body>

      <body>A federal judge is hearing arguments over whether Detroit city should be granted protection from its creditors. In opening remarks, Bruce Bennett, the lead attorney for Detroit, said there was a "mountain of evidence showing the insolvency of the city". But representatives for the city's unions and pension funds disagree and say the city is solvent. With $18bn (£11bn) of liabilities, Detroit's case is the biggest municipal bankruptcy filing in US history. The case to determine whether or not Detroit can continue with its bankruptcy filing is expected to last anywhere from five to 10 days. In opening testimony, Jennifer Green, a lawyer for the Detroit pension fund boards, argued that the city and the state of Michigan had always planned to file for bankruptcy - despite earlier assurances in 2013 that newly appointed emergency manager Kevyn Orr would be evaluating all options. As part of the bankruptcy hearing, the unions and pension funds are trying to prove that the city did not negotiate with them "in good faith". If Steven Rhodes, the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case, agrees with them, the city would have to go back to the drawing board. Protesters outside the court in particular singled out Mr Orr, chanting, "Down with Orr" and "Orr no more". The appointment of Mr Orr, who is scheduled to testify on Monday, was controversial as it was done without voter support. Unions and pension funds won a small victory when it was ruled that Michigan governor Rick Snyder would have to testify on Friday. Furthermore, lawyers for the city admitted that plans to sell some works from the Detroit Institute of Arts might have to be shelved unless there is a leadership change at the museum. Current director Graham Beal has said the plan is "abhorrent" and has vowed to fight any efforts to sell the museum's artworks, which include major works by Henri Matisse and Vincent van Gogh. However, many experts still believe that the judge will eventually rule in Detroit's favour. City managers say bankruptcy is the only way to manage Detroit's debts and liabilities. Half of the city's liabilities result from payments to retired staff, which includes healthcare and pension obligations. In May, Mr Orr presented a report on Detroit's financial situation. It said Detroit's expenditures had exceeded revenues by an average of $100m each year from 2008 to 2012. Detroit has seen a dramatic decline in economic activity and population, as the big car makers - once the city's main source of employment - shifted production to cheaper locations in the US and overseas. The city is now home to about 700,000 residents, down from the peak of 1.8 million in 1950. There are almost 150,000 vacant and abandoned plots in the city according to the Detroit Future City report. </body>

      <title>Bank says Spain out of recession</title>
      <description>Spain's economy has emerged from recession, according to the country's central bank, after growing by 0.1% in the July-to-September quarter.</description>

      <body>Spain's economy has emerged from recession after growing for the first time in more than two years, according to estimates from the Bank of Spain. Spain's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.1% between July and September, the bank said. However, GDP was still 1.2% lower in the quarter compared with the same period last year. Spain's economy has been struggling ever since the credit crisis struck in 2008. The bank's figures are an estimate, and the country's National Statistics agency INE is due to release preliminary third quarter GDP data on 30 October. The Bank of Spain said the country's economy had been helped by stronger exports in the past quarter. "The slight recovery in activity in the third quarter after the fall a quarter earlier is due to... a more favourable contribution from the external sector," it said in its monthly bulletin. Spain has been one of the countries worst hit by the fallout from the credit crisis. The crisis burst the country's housing bubble, and its banks needed government bailouts to survive after being left holding hundreds of billions of euros in bad debts. Its unemployment rate of more than 26% is one of the highest in Europe. Government austerity measures aimed at cutting Spain's large deficit prompted huge protests across the country last year. However, the government recently claimed that the end of the recession was near, saying reforms and austerity measures were paying off. Ignacio del Torre, economist at financial advisory firm Arcano, said: "After recently implemented reforms, Spain has become an export powerhouse. "It will fully leave the recession behind in 2014 with private investment and consumption growth turning positive after three years of decline and credit levels stabilising," he added. </body>

      <title>Ethiopia's leather industry booming</title>
      <description>Ethiopia's leather industry is enjoying a big rise in exports, and one British company is at the centre of things, reports James Jeffrey in Addis Ababa.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24610075</url>
      <date>1382570080</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70651000/jpg/_70651844_sewing1.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Amid the rhythmic clicking of rows and rows of sewing machines, hundreds of workers are busy creating a range of leather gloves, bags and jackets. "I can tell when employees' skills have improved by the noises of the machines speeding up," says Tsedenia Mekbib, a general manager. We are at a busy factory on the outskirts of the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. It is one of three such facilities in the city owned by UK leather goods company Pittards, which has a long history of operating in the country. While an increasing number of Western firms of all sizes are now looking at doing business in Africa, Pittards has had a 90-year head start. The company, which is based in Yeovil, Somerset, in the south-west of England, has been trading in Ethiopia since the 1920s. And it is all down to a celebrated type of sheep - the Ethiopian hair sheep. This breed, which does not grow a thick coat of wool, also has much thinner skin than its European brethren, making it ideal for delicate leather apparel such as ladies' gloves. Pittards now has ambitious plans to grow its Ethiopian operations, which help contribute towards the firm's £39m ($60m) annual revenues. At present its Addis Ababa-based factories and tannery to the south of the city employ about 1,200 locals, a number expected to grow to about 5,000 within five years. A fourth factory has already been built, and is waiting to be occupied. On the current production floors, an element of handwork is also included in the manufacturing process, which each month produces 100,000 work gloves and 5,000 dress gloves. Pittards' Ethiopian factories also produce two million sq feet (186,000 sq m) of quality leather for export to be made into garments ranging from specialist golf gloves to couture handbags. "Ethiopia will grow in importance to Pittards and the global leather industry [in general]," says the company's chief executive Reg Hankey. Ethiopia's attractions for Pittards, and other Western firms, include the country's large pool of relatively low-cost labour. It also has duty-free status for most manufactured products for export to Europe, the US and other countries. Despite Ethiopia having the largest flock of hair sheep in the world - more than 26 million - it is not the largest supplier of skins. Its flock's reproductive rate of about 37% trails New Zealand's 180% and means Ethiopia has only some 9.5 million sheepskins available annually compared with New Zealand's total of about 30 million. Better animal husbandry should increase Ethiopia's supply. Pittards is already involved in environmental programmes to improve the quality of local skins through improved husbandry and treatment against parasites. Another benefit could be improved meat yields, a not insignificant detail while Ethiopia remains a developing country. Regarding the wider issues of doing business in Ethiopia, Mr Hankey says the country faces the same challenges as other developing nations, encompassing difficulties related to bureaucracy, customs and banking. Yet, he adds, while more has to be done, the situation is greatly improved. "Ethiopia has come a very long way over the last 23 years since I first visited, and the last decade in particular has witnessed massive positive changes," Mr Hankey says. "Ethiopia has worked very hard to establish itself as a preferred country for economic development within Africa." Ethiopia's government now wants to grow its leather industry's annual exports to $500m by the completion of its five-year growth and transformation plan at the end of 2015. Leather exports stood at $123m last year. Within Pittards, the British management is happy to be playing a part in Ethiopia reaching its ambitious goal. "We have put down roots," Mr Hankey says. "This changes relationships and thinking - we see things from the inside and the outside, giving us a unique position for further development." Busy at work in the Pittards factory is 20-year-old Embret Beshada. Her job is to sew two glove-shaped panels together while incorporating material to create a thumb casing. She says she found the work easy when she started just over a year ago, despite having to learn many new skills, and was producing gloves within two months. "Being able to support myself excites me the most," she says. Sitting at sewing machines nearby are some of her friends. About 80% of the factory workforce is female, while at the tannery about 80% of the workforce is male. "We are seeing people get more jobs, and people's lifestyles changing, which gives us hope for the future," Ms Beshada adds. </body>

      <title>The tech boss who says it is all about the staff</title>
      <description>A profile of Robert Stanzione, the boss of technology firm Arris, which has expanded greatly under his stewardship.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24517646</url>
      <date>1382310914</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70483000/jpg/_70483106_arrisbob.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Robert Stanzione is the boss of one of the largest companies you have probably never heard of. Mr Stanzione is chief executive of fast-growing US technology group Arris. The company makes set-top boxes, and other pieces of hardware and software for digital television and broadband services. Arris made the business headlines at the end of last year when it agreed a $2.35bn (£1.5bn) deal to buy the Motorola Home set-top box business from Google. The internet giant had put Motorola Home up for sale after it had bought parent group Motorola Mobility, the main part of which was Motorola's mobile phone business. Arris' purchase of Motorola Home was completed in the spring of this year, and saw the Georgia-based company - in terms of turnover - triple in size overnight. It means that in the US, the Arris name will increasingly be seen on set-top boxes as the Motorola brand is retired. Whereas in the UK, Arris' technology is already used by the likes of BT and Virgin Media. Mr Stanzione said the Motorola Home deal highlighted Arris' continuing ambition. "As soon as we heard rumours that it was going to be up for sale, we began to look at where it would take us, it will fuel our continued growth as a company," says Mr Stanzione. "We have tripled the size of the company over the past decade, and this deal sees us grow by that amount again. It is all credit to the team around me." Chief executive of Arris since it was founded in 1995, Mr Stanzione, 65, says he has a very simple but effective strategy for leadership - bringing in the best people to work with him. "Find the right people, keep them, and motivate them," he says. "Let them know how important they are, and give them clear responsibility. I think that's the key to success." Mr Stanzione says he wanted to make a difference in life. "I have always had this curiosity, always had the desire to be around smart people, and participate in a way that would change things," he says. "I am very excited by helping to create new solutions to old problems, being more efficient, more effective." Mr Stanzione adds that while he has always been persistent in his career, he is happy to admit to having had some good fortune along the way. "I have had an element of luck, it would be remiss of me not to say that. Sometimes being in the right place at the right time matters." With a degree in mechanical engineering from Clemson University in South Carolina, and a masters in industrial engineering from North Carolina State University, before joining Arris, Mr Stanzione held a range of engineering and management positions at US telecoms group ATandT. His advice to young people who aspire to go on and lead a large company is to follow his example and get some good qualifications. "First of all, get as much education as you can," he says. "Then get involved in something you enjoy and stick with it. "But success is a very personal thing. For some, ambition is to rise to the top of an organisation - but for others it is earning a lot of money, or something else. "I'd say your primary goal should be to be involved in something meaningful that you also enjoy." With Arris enjoying $1.3bn (£805m) of revenues last year, it was certainly already successful before the Motorola Home takeover. The deal itself saw Arris pay Google $2.2bn in cash, which it funded though debt financing, and the sale of a 7.7% share in its business-to-cable TV firm Comcast. Arris also gave Google 10.6 million of its shares, which gives Google the same minority stake in Arris as Comcast. Mr Stanzione said Arris and its 6,500 employees were now continuing with its aim to cement its position as the world's best provider of the technology behind on-demand TV content. Yet with rivals from around the globe, and especially China, he says he is never complacent. "I'm paranoid every day," he says. "I'm always looking over my shoulder at the competitors, be they other strong American companies, or other rivals from Asia." Mr Stanzione adds that the best business advice he ever received was "keep the organisation lean", and use "small empowered teams". Now the age of a pensioner and married to wife Kaye for almost 45 years, Mr Stanzione says that while he loves spending time with his 10 grandchildren, he has no plans to retire. "To me if you enjoy your work, and I certainly do, then that is you relaxing," he says. "If someone can look at you and not be able to tell if you are working or playing, that is a pretty good place to be." </body>

      <title>How big retailers learned to love fashion</title>
      <description>Big retailers are rethinking the way they sell clothing and going for a high fashion rather than a low price approach.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24516542</url>
      <date>1382052318</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70498000/jpg/_70498325_modelssupermarket2afp.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>When Sir Stuart Rose says something on retail, it's worth listening. With a 40-year track record in the industry, the former chief executive and chairman of Marks and Spencer is famed for turning around struggling retailers. Now an independent, non-executive director at South Africa's Woolworths Holdings, a chain of shops selling fashion, food, beauty and home ware, he says retail has changed. "Where the customer used to be king before, the customer is now the master of the universe: and they want what they want, how they want it, when they want it." For Woolworths, this shift has been felt most keenly in clothing - an area that along with beauty and home ware makes up 38% of its business in South Africa. In response, over the past two to three years it has made a conscious effort to make its clothing more fashionable, which crucially has involved getting it from the design stage to the shop floor much more quickly. "Previously it was 11-months-plus for all of our clothing products to the point now where we can turn [an item] around in 90 days," says Ian Moir, chief executive of Woolworths (which has no connection with the former British High Street chain of the same name). The strategy appears to be working. The company's most recent results for the year to the end of June saw clothing sales grow by 13.7%. "If we don't give the customer the trend, the colour, the fashion they're looking for, at the end of the day they're going to go somewhere else," says Mr Moir. Neil Saunders, managing director at retail consultancy Conlumino, says the changes at Woolworths reflect a "sea change" in how supermarket groups sell clothing. "They have become more like clothing retailers. Five years ago they used to merchandise it in the same way as, for example, baked beans. They piled it high and sold it cheap. But now they have become lifestyle rather than commodity-led." Mr Saunders says the 2008 financial crisis and resulting recession is a key reason behind this change in approach, with a trend for people to choose quality items that they expect to last. "Before the recession people bought lots of stuff... they even bought stuff they didn't wear. There was a disposable element because clothing was cheap and people felt affluent. "People are more frugal now. They buy less stuff and follow the ethos of, 'If you buy it right you buy it once.'" Mr Saunders says, however, that low prices can still lure in customers if they are combined with fashion, citing Primark as an example. "It's on trend and that makes people very interested. But if a retailer just chases value then they struggle," he adds. UK supermarket group Sainsbury's founded its clothing range Tu almost a decade ago. James Brown, clothing business director at Sainsbury's, says when Tu began it was focused on core products such as leggings, jogging bottoms and T-shirts, with ranges changed every 12 weeks or longer. But in the past two years it has become more trend-led. "Since our recent rebrand the new Tu range is refreshed every six weeks to keep up with the latest fashions, and offer new products to our customer," says Mr Brown. "Over the last nine years we have learnt more about our broad customer base and have adapted the range to offer more High Street-style garments at supermarket prices to meet customer demand," he adds. The approach seems to be working - at its recent trading update for the 16 weeks to 28 September it said its general merchandise and clothing business grew at more than twice the rate of its food business. Mr Brown says new items are planned up to seven months in advance, but that it can react quickly to last-minute trends by turning around a style in just eight weeks, assuming it can get the necessary fabric and has the production capacity. In contrast, for High Street chain Zara, production capacity is rarely an issue because unusually its owner Inditex has its own factories. These manufacture what it says is a "significant share" of its clothing for its eight brands, which include upmarket Massimo Dutti and teen label Bershka, but primarily the most fashionable garments. For those items the clothes can be produced and in store in a rapid two to three weeks. "Customer expectations are higher than ever so our capability to adapt and react to their demands is one of our key strengths," says an Inditex source. For Ian Moir, this is the key to Woolworths' future. "The importance of fashion is becoming greater and greater and customer awareness is getting better and better. "They're very fashion aware and they want it now. That's the way the world is going, it's the way it's changing and it's the way we've got to change as a business."

      <title>French clubs to strike over tax row</title>
      <description>French clubs in the top two divisions will go on strike for four days in November in protest at 'super taxes'.</description>

      <body>French clubs will go on strike in November in protest at plans to impose higher taxes on players' wages. The government wants a 75% 'super tax' on those earning an annual salary of more than 1m euros (£850,000) . Jean-Pierre Louvel, president of professional clubs' union UCPF, said: "There will be a weekend without a game at the end of the month (November)." The strike will affect matches in Ligue 1 and 2 - the top two divisions - from 29 November to 2 December. Under the proposal, companies, rather than individuals, would be liable to pay the 75% tax rate for the part of employees' annual salaries that exceed 1million euros. Paris St-Germain, who are backed by Qatar investors, will be the hardest hit by the tax. Monaco, who are funded by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, will be exempt as they do not fall under French tax laws. The concern among clubs is that the 'super tax' will deter footballers from playing for sides in France. The issue will be debated in parliament, and French president Francois Hollande will meet representatives of the French clubs next week to discuss the issue. Initial plans were for individuals earning more than 1million euros to pay the 75% rate, but the government changed the proposals after protests by top French executives and actors such as Gerard Depardieu. Ligue 1 clubs registered a loss of 108 million euros (£92m) at the end of the 2011-12 season with the accumulated loss over the last three seasons amounting to 303m euros (£259m). Louvel added: "There is already a deficit in our sector and now they impose a new tax. Football has a role in society and that will be affected as a consequence of these new measures. "This unprecedented day is an opportunity for the silent majority of French football to express their opposition." </body>

      <body>The Indian Grand Prix will go ahead as scheduled this weekend after a hearing into alleged tax irregularities was delayed until next week. Campaigner Amit Kumar had accused race promoters of not paying entertainment taxes for the 2012 event and demanded the cancellation of Sunday's race. But a court official said: "The case will now be heard next week." The Indian Grand Prix has been dropped from next year's calendar but promoters are optimistic of a return in 2015. Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel, who leads Ferrari rival Fernando Alonso by 90 points with 100 still available, is expected to clinch his fourth world crown this Sunday. The German, who has led every racing lap at the Indian Grand Prix since its debut in 2011, will claim the title if he ends up fifth or higher, regardless of where Alonso finishes. The long-term future of the Indian Grand Prix is uncertain after F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone removed the race from the 2014 calendar. Organisers are trying to find a new date for its return in 2015, with Ecclestone keen for the race to take place in the early part of the season, rather than its current October date. </body>

      <body>A second sale of tickets for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow has seen "high demand" with delays of more than 60 minutes for online booking. People who did not manage to get any tickets during the first sale can make purchases on Monday and Tuesday. From 10:00 on Wednesday, applicants who received some tickets in the first sale will also be able buy additional ones. Rugby sevens, badminton, hockey, table tennis, squash, bowls and weightlifting are said to have the best availability. Limited tickets also remain for some sessions of athletics, boxing and rhythmic gymnastics. After the second sale commenced at 10:00 on Tuesday, some people went online to express delight at netting the tickets of their choice, while others spoke of delays of "more than 60 minutes" as they tried to book seats online. The official Glasgow 2014 Twitter account welcomed people's patience amid the strong demand. One message said: "We're experiencing very high demand for #2014tickets. The site is up and selling but the queues are large and we appreciate your patience." Another message said: "Call volumes to the ticketing hotline are very high." In feedback made to the BBC news website, one ticket hopeful, Carole Young, said: "Logged on to official site at 10.03 am, now 11.34 am still waiting in a queue very very disappointed." Another, Jacqueline Farrell, said: "I have been sitting on line since 9.15 this morning waiting to log onto our accounts. "The browser kept trying to do something but nothing and then it logged me out and then I had to sign back in and am now in a further 60 minute queue - so, so disappointing." Others, like Fiona, however, expressed their delight at securing tickets: "I was unsuccessful getting tickets in the first ballot and tried again this morning. "Was really pleased to get myself and my daughter day and evening tickets to the rhythmic gymnastics on the 24th July." Craig Martin was also successful: "Was in the queue for about an hour then was allowed to buy tickets - there were quite a few left. "Think I got the last athletics tickets. Also got tickets to see Northern Ireland in netball and tickets for lawn bowls." During the initial four-week window for the Glasgow 2014 Games, there were 2.3 million requests for up to one million tickets. Of the 17 sports on offer, track cycling, diving, swimming, judo, shooting and the 100m sprint final were all over-subscribed and needed ballots to select who received tickets. The second batch of tickets are being allocated on a first-come, first-served basis through the official ticketing website or ticket hotline. From Wednesday the sale will be opened up to people who got some of the tickets they wanted, before all of the Glasgow 2014 ticket applicants are invited to buy tickets until 18:00 on Saturday. Any remaining tickets will then be put on general sale. Ty Speer, deputy chief executive of Glasgow 2014 said: "We're all set for this exciting new phase of ticketing during which there may be periods of high demand as people select and buy their sports and sessions. "At these times we'd appreciate the patience of all customers. We will be working hard to process all orders as quickly as possible." The Commonwealth Games Baton Relay is also currently making its way round the world before returning to Scotland next year. </body>

      <body>Four of the big six energy companies have announced price rises in recent weeks, adding pressure to household budgets over the winter. It is estimated five million people in the UK are already living in fuel poverty, which means they spend more than 10% of their income on heating their homes. The campaign group Energy Bill Revolution - an alliance of charities including Age UK and Barnardo's - says that figure will rise further and become a national crisis. Campaign director Ed Matthew urged the government to make insulating homes the UK's top infrastructure priority. </body>

      <body>Joe Grice from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has given a breakdown of the latest GDP figures, which suggest UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September. He said all the main sectors had grown, with the economy 2.5% below the pre-recession peak: "Nearly two-thirds of the fall in output has now been recovered." But, he added, not all sectors had recovered evenly: "Manufacturing remains 8.9% lower than its pre-recession peak and construction 12.5% lower." </body>

      <body>If there's any part of the UK that's looking forward to the benefits of growth, it's the North East of England. It has the highest rate of unemployment and the lowest rate of job creation in the country. More than 20% of workers in the North East are employed in the public sector, the highest proportion of the workforce in England. Public sector cuts have hit the region hard since 2010, but like the overall national picture the private sector in the region has continued to create jobs. Exporters have thrived and the North East is now the only region in England that exports more than it imports. So how are businesses and workers feeling about the recovery? Chris Dennell, technician, Quick Hydraulics Chris Dennell thinks nothing of working seven days a week at the Quick Hydraulics factory in North Shields. The 29-year-old has been in the industry for nine years and has never seen business so good. "Work seems to have increased tenfold over the past few years. It's been a real challenge trying to keep up with demand. "We feel we have a responsibility to the company to get the work done - to keep things moving forward." The overtime Chris does at weekends has allowed him to save for his wedding. But despite being in a secure job with annual pay increases he's found the cost of living a challenge. "My wife and I have always budgeted for our monthly outgoings but with the price of gas and electricity going up, we have had to tighten our belts and cut down on the luxuries that we used to buy. "I've given up my season ticket for the football at Sunderland as I can only save for one thing at a time." Andrew Esson, chief executive, Quick Hydraulics Andrew Esson bought Quick Hydraulics two years ago and has not looked back since. The company has gone from 14 employees to 29 and he's hoping to take on more in the coming months. "We feel the pulse of business in the North East and what we are finding is that companies who weren't investing two years ago, are now having funds released and are kicking new projects into action." The company supplies parts to companies in industries ranging from oil and gas to paper processing. Sales are up 25% on last year, with many customers benefiting from booming emerging market economies. "Two years ago I would have said that if you were exporting to Europe, you were not doing well - but now we are seeing that anyone who's exporting is beginning to do well. "Our biggest challenge in the North East is that we have a skills shortage. "We had a board meeting this morning and we agreed to recruit some new staff to keep up with demand, but the challenge is to find people with the right skill levels." James Ramsbotham, chief executive, North East Chamber of Commerce As chairman of a local construction group, James Ramsbotham has seen the strain of the recession up close over the last five years. But in his role as head of the North East Chamber of Commerce, he's becoming increasingly optimistic about the recovery in the region. "Four years ago businesses like Nissan [based in Sunderland] were employing only 3,000 people, now they are employing 6,000. "We are also a major part of the supply chain for the oil and gas sector in the North Sea, which has thrived over the past few years." Mr Ramsbotham says that the nascent economic recovery is beginning to give businesses the confidence they need to expand. "In the first two quarters of this year, we saw some real confidence in sales - both domestic and export sales for which this region does so well. "Now what we've seen is that becoming a confidence to invest in plants and machinery, and also in taking on new staff and training them up." Although the private sector is creating jobs, Mr Ramsbotham says the public sector is still a drag on the local economy. "We've very much got a two-speed economy - we've got the really good engineering and manufacturing industries that are doing incredibly well. "But when you look up in the High Street and you see the retail sector on its knees, you realise the impact that the cuts in the public sector have had on spending in the region." </body>

      <title>The iconic voices of technology</title>
      <description>Meeting the faces behind technology's most iconic voices</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24637672</url>

      <body>Millions of people hear their voices every day - but would you recognise them if you saw them walking down the street? Well maybe now you will. The BBC met the faces behind four of the most famous and iconic voices heard in technology today. Siri, Apple's voice-powered personal assistant, made its debut in June 2010. Since then, millions of the devices with the feature have been sold worldwide. In the UK, the voice you will hear responding to commands belongs to Jon Briggs, an illustrious voiceover artist whose portfolio includes the likes of the Weakest Link, Radio 2 and Channel 4. Jon had offered up his voice to a firm that specialises in computer-generated speech - that is, taking Jon's voice but moulding it to say virtually any possible phrase. Apple, when creating Siri, picked out Jon - unbeknownst to him. "I discovered that I was being used as the voice of Siri when Rory Cellan-Jones, the BBC technology correspondent, suddenly started demonstrating it on BBC Breakfast. "I thought 'I recognise that voice!', and so it was true - and it's a slightly bizarre journey since then." It means that while his voice is now being played out countless times a day all over the country, Apple has not paid him - he only received the fee earned he when recording the original material. But, he says he's excited to be "in early" on what he believes is changing how we use technology. "You can take a photograph of your desk - there is a screen a keyboard and a mouse. "You will show it to your children or your grandchildren and they will laugh and go 'you had a thing called a mouse? What's that funny thing with letters on?'" In contrast to the received pronunciation of her "Tube" voice, Emma Clarke's speaking voice is in fact Northern - growing up, as she did, in Sale near Manchester. Her voice can be heard across the Bakerloo, Central and District lines of London's iconic Underground network. The process of getting the job was long and painstaking - months of focus groups and whittling down possible candidates. During the selection, each possible voice was given a codename. Emma's, apparently, was 'Marilyn'. "Had they named me 'Brenda' I'm not sure I'd have got the gig," she jokes. She now gets fan mail from all over the world, particularly from Texas. "People initially thought I was actually on the train!" she says, "Or in some kind of central control room. I don't know where they thought it was." She says she is proud to lend her voice to the network, but adds that she hopes some of the lines she recorded never have to be heard by the public. "There were a couple of emergency announcements, that I remember when I read them on the script I thought 'oh god, imagine how these people will feel when they hear these announcements. "I felt such a sense of responsibility, of calming people down." Unlike the other voices in this piece, Terry Green is the only one who doesn't consider his voice to be his profession. He found his way to audio fame indirectly. He specialises in customer service, and the systems used in shops to get things moving and punters through the tills. And so it was, when the company he was working for needed a male voice to beckon people to the till, he stepped forward: "Cashier number three, please..." "We just sat down with a digital voice recorder, laid down the track, and that was it! I was on the prototype system, and then suddenly rolled out to 8,000 shops." They recorded up to cashier number 25 - but now the system goes much further. Indeed, around the world, the company's technology is used in thousands of stores - although with local voices instead of Terry's. Now he makes his living as a leading expert on the study of shoppers' behaviour. "My voice was on all these systems that we were rolling out, so I was becoming more and better known. I started writing white papers, and eventually I came to write a book." One morning, Sara Mendes da Costa was listening to Terry Wogan on Radio 2 when he mentioned that a competition would be held to find the new voice of the Speaking Clock. "A little bell rang in my head and I went 'oooh!'" She wasn't alone - within moments she had had calls friends and family saying she should put herself forward. She won, and from 2007 she took over the voice of the Speaking Clock, which is called up approximately 60 million times each year. It was a job she was excited, but nervous, to take on. "Brian Cobby, who sadly passed away last year, had the most beautiful, rich, Shakespearian voice. "Then I came along - I have visions of people going 'oh...'!" "But they wanted something different, someone a bit more of the moment, a little bit more who we are now." Sara uses the Speaking Clock regularly in her day-to-day work, and admits she just can't resist listening to each and every word. "I listen until when it goes through to 'precisely' - and only then I can hang up! "It's just a weird thing that I've got." Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <body>Getting around without your own car in South Africa can drive you crazy, pardon the pun. But a new range of cab hailing applications for smartphones, which use GPS positioning to connect you to the closest cabs, is making it easier to move around. Snappcab, Zapacab, Afta Robot and Go Metro are all examples of local mobile platforms to serve South Africa's diverse commuters. Zapacab became South Africa's first cab hailing mobile platform, when it launched in August. "People are using their phones in smarter and smarter ways," says Rupert Sully, founder of Zapacab. He says the amount of Zapacab users from different demographics is "testimony to this wave that's growing in Africa at the moment, this upsurge of technology, particularly in mobile". Snappcab launched shortly after. Its managing director Anton van Metzinger says safety is of paramount importance: "It's about efficiency. It's about safety." Snappcab tells passengers the driver's name and also allows a commuter to know what their driver and the car look like. The app also allows the commuter to contact the driver directly and plot the driver's headway on a map on their smartphone. The entire trip is on record with Snappcab, providing an extra sense of security and preventing dodgy detours from taking place. Zapacab's Mr Sully says that their drivers are preselected and have received some training, but there are challenges, as introducing the app is not just a "plug and play" process. "They [the drivers] are very comfortable with the whole concept that these markets are becoming more tech-savvy, but just to teach them how to use smartphone interfaces that we place in their cars, is a unique challenge." Teaching the drivers how to use the app is not the only challenge that the local app creators face. They also face competition from global giants such as Uber, which launched in South Africa earlier this month. Uber states that it's "everyone's private driver", it caters to upmarket commuters who want to be chauffeured in luxury cars such as the BMW 7 series and Mercedes Benz S550s and has a presence in around 50 cities worldwide. However, the local firms feel that their apps are tailored for South Africans, and therefore they have an advantage. Mr Sully says that Uber "is not necessarily custom-made for the needs here". "It's not just about replicating things that work elsewhere, it's trying to find out what works here," he states. But Uber's international launcher, Patrick Studener, responds that even though Uber is a global brand, it has localised its product to cater to the South African market and is doing very well in the country. "We don't fly people in from San Francisco to run South Africa. We have South Africans working in South Africa," he says. "We do tackle every problem as it comes locally, and we have local community managers, we have local operations managers who look after the local community and that's the model to making it work locally." Uber also stresses that it was important to come to South Africa because Africa is a "great emerging market space". While Snappcab and Zapacab cater to cab commuters, many South Africans actually travel by minibus taxi, bus and train. The Innovation Hub has funded Snappcab and various other mobile platforms that aim to revolutionise the transportation space, like Go Metro for train users and Afta Robot for mini bus taxi commuters. Gary Bannatyne, incubation business development manager at the Innovation Hub says that there's a huge push for ICT development in the transportation service sector because technology is the only way forward. "Technology is crucial, mobile technology is very crucial in the transport space and it's a huge focus of ours to enable these guys who have the solutions in that space." And the local firms who are making their name in that transport space have ambitions beyond South Africa's borders. Both Zapacab and Snappcab have plans to expand further into Africa. As Zapacab's Mr Sully puts it, their expansion ambitions "really show how technology can go beyond borders to influence the way our markets interact with each other". "[That] really says a lot about how technology is playing out on this continent." </body>

      <title>Leah Busque: Taskrabbit's early days</title>
      <description>How dog food inspired one entrepreneur</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24641936</url>

      <body>One thing many entrepreneurs have in common is the way they respond to problems they find irritating or annoying. Instead of just accepting the frustrations they encounter, they try to do something to fix the situation. The result can often be a new kind of business. For Leah Busque, founder of online errand-running business Taskrabbit, the event that caused her to start a company happened one evening when she and her husband had just called a cab to take them to meet friends for dinner. "We realised we had run out of dog food," she says. At the time the couple lived in Boston, Massachusetts, where Ms Busque worked at IBM as a software engineer. Worried that all the shops would be closed on their way home, she and her husband began discussing the problem. "My husband's also in technology, so we've always had these very geeky conversations," she says. "And that night it turned into, 'Wouldn't it be nice if there was just a place online we could go, say we needed dog food, name the price we're willing to pay?' "We were certain that there was someone in our own neighbourhood that would be willing to help us out, and it was just a matter of connecting with them." Before she left the house that evening, Ms Busque used her phone to register an internet domain name for her new business idea. A few months later, she left her job at IBM to work full time on the project. Once they've hit on what they think is a good idea, many entrepreneurs keep it to themselves, fearful that others might steal it. Leah Busque took the opposite approach. She says she talked to "anyone who would listen - family, friends, the guy sitting next to me on the bus, the person in the coffee shop, it didn't matter". She noticed that out of hundreds of conversations "no-one said, 'You're insane. This is not a good idea.' Everyone was like, 'Why doesn't this exist yet?'" Convinced there was a real potential market, she pressed on with her plan. "Ignorance is bliss, I think, when you're first starting out," she says. "I wasn't thinking about starting a company, about raising money, about hiring. I was just thinking, I have to build this idea in my head." Ms Busque began by putting an advertisement on Craigslist, an online classified advertising service, seeking people to help her try out her idea. She was surprised by the response. "I thought I would get all these college students involved that would want to make extra money… but that actually wasn't the case at all," she says. As well as students, there were enquiries from retired people and out-of-work professionals such as lawyers, pharmacists and teachers. But, Ms Busque says, the idea resonated most of all with working mothers. This group seemed not only to be interested in part-time work as errand-runners, but also in becoming customers of the service. "They were trying to balance work and life and kids, and they would love for someone to deliver their groceries or pick up the dry cleaning," Ms Busque says. For her experimental run, Ms Busque spent many hours in local coffee shops interviewing about 100 people, picking 30 of them to take part. The experience helped her later on, when she was developing a more automated vetting and background-checking system for errand-runners. Ms Busque's plan involved creating an online marketplace, where customers who wanted small tasks done could connect with people willing to carry them out. Customers would invite bids for various jobs. The company would offer guidance on pricing for many popular tasks and would take a percentage of the price paid, to cover its costs. A reputation ranking system and profiles of errand-runners would help customers to choose the right person for their job. After a successful small-scale trial, Ms Busque set about building an enterprise. A chance conversation led her to contact Scott Griffith, who was chief executive of car-sharing business Zipcar at the time. Mr Griffith liked the sound of her plans and offered her space in the Zipcar offices while she got the business off the ground. "It was an incredible opportunity," says Ms Busque. "I got to watch [Scott] run a 200-person company and grow it and scale it and raise money of his own right before my eyes." Despite this help, turning an idea into a business was not easy, particularly in late 2008 and 2009. "It was a really tough time to be raising money," says Ms Busque. "We were in a recession. Investors were not investing. And so that was incredibly stressful and took up a lot of time and energy and a lot of late nights wondering if we should continue or not." Ms Busque persisted in her efforts to find backers. A breakthrough came after she spent several weeks attending a business incubator programme in California, run by social networking giant Facebook. "It was kind of like a start-up boot camp - I just learned so much," she says. Partly through connections she made through the incubator programme, she was able to put together a round of seed-funding, so she could take her business to the next stage. It was Ms Busque's first visit to the west coast of the US, and she found the atmosphere of Silicon Valley inspiring. She decided to open a second base in San Francisco, which is where the company now has its headquarters. The firm now operates in several US cities. It is also looking to expand overseas and is planning to launch an operation in the UK soon. Taskrabbit is just one example of a player in the so-called "sharing economy", where firms attempt to use the internet to make better use of facilities that have spare capacity. Other examples include car-ride sharing firm Zimride, wi-fi access sharing business FON, and Airbnb, which enables home owners to rent out spare rooms as holiday accommodation. Compared with, say, a manufacturing business, an internet-based company might seem fairly easy to set up. It also means that online businesses might find they have more competitors than traditional ones. Certainly, Taskrabbit has not found its path to be completely smooth. In July, the company had to lose some staff. Taskrabbit has expanded from domestic errands into offering help to businesses - a field currently dominated by some huge temporary employment agencies. Ms Busque says she's not worried about competition from big players. "The temporary labour industry is one that hasn't been reinvented in decades, and so it's prime for disruption," she says. "We're really excited about tackling that market." It remains to be seen whether Leah Busque and her errand-runners are equal to the task. </body>

      <title>South Africa in bid to end politicians' 'high lifestyle'</title>
      <description>South Africa cracks down on politicians expenses</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24661004</url>

      <body>South Africans have applauded tough new measures announced by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan to curb government spending on alcohol and air travel, as well as the alleged abuse of credit cards, in an attempt to cut costs. The move came as the African National Congress (ANC) government, in power since white-minority rule ended in 1994, tries to improve its image ahead of next year's election. Though the party is almost certain to be re-elected, its 66% majority is likely to fall amid allegations of failing to do enough to improve the lives of poor people, widespread corruption and abuse of taxpayers' money. South Africans have been overwhelmed with media reports of free spending and high-rolling ministers over the years. One recent example is Northern Cape's new provincial government premier Sylvia Lucas who came in for strong criticism for spending around $5,000 (£3,000) on fast food purchases on a government credit card during her first 10 weeks in office. In his last cabinet reshuffle, President Jacob Zuma fired Communications Minister Dina Pule following allegations that she had allowed her boyfriend to travel with her at the state's expense. Some government ministers have also been embroiled in allegations of rigging tenders in favour of friends. Others have been accused of indulging themselves with cars costing more than $100,000, expensive tastes in wine and five-star accommodation and travel around the world. Delivering his Medium Term Budget Policy Speech in parliament on Wednesday, Mr Gordhan read the riot act to big-spending ministers and public officials. He trimmed the fat on travel perks, blew the bubbles out of excessive alcohol and banned the use of credit cards. From 1 December, no alcohol will be served at government functions and spending on an event should not exceed $200, he said. Also, government ministers and officials will have to fly economy class - no more first or business class - and in fewer numbers and frequency, Mr Gordhan said. The main parliamentary opposition, the Democratic Alliance (DA), said it welcomed the austerity measures against wasteful spending, but said this should have long been the norm. Pieter Mulder, the leader of the small opposition Freedom Front Plus party, agreed. "There's not enough money any more. Now he [Gordhan] comes with all these government discipline measures, which I really think should have been done 20 years ago," he is quoting as saying. Nevertheless, the speech was typical Gordhan, decisive and engaging. He spoke of strong revenue collection, savings of about $80m from under-spending ministries, and a lower than forecast budget deficit of 4.2% which helped allay market fears and bolster sentiment among credit rating agencies. Annabel Bishop, an economist at private firm Investec, said she expected the budget to satisfy the capital markets and impress ratings agencies. "We believe... [the] budget outcome is not likely, in isolation, to prompt any of the rating agencies to downgrade SA's rating," she said. But there were some sad reflections on the year to date. Industrial action in the last year and, in particular a long drawn out two-month strike in the automotive sector, exerted a heavy toll on the economy. Projected GDP growth fell from 2.7% to an anaemic 2.1%. Opposition Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi believes the announcements were nothing more than smoke and mirrors for the benefit of investor confidence. "I think he did just enough to get the credit rating agencies off our back. I think he's sending a very strong signal with regard to cutting ministers' expenses. It's small money in the overall budget but it's sending a strong message," he said. DA spokesman Tim Harris said the mini budget was not nearly bold enough in tackling serious economic problems - or what the treasury calls "labour disputes, electricity shortages and other supply-side disruptions" in Africa's biggest economy. Nevertheless, the hope among many South Africans is that Mr Gordhan has guaranteed economic stability and boosted confidence in South Africa's future. </body>

      <body>Only three years old and with two years to run on its contract, India's Grand Prix is already facing an uncertain future. Bringing Formula 1 to India has cost more than $400m (£246m) and while it attracts some of the world's fastest cars and best drivers, many are questioning if the economic spin-offs are attractive enough for companies to put their money behind the event. The race itself has attracted huge audiences, with tens of thousands at the venue and millions around the world watching it on TV. But is it making enough money? That's the big concern that is dominating the race this year. Though that does not seem to have dampened sponsorship events. Drivers and divas from Bollywood dominate the glamorous events around race day at the Buddh International Race Circuit in Noida on the outskirts of Delhi. McLaren Mercedes F1 driver Sergio Perez accepts that motorsport is yet to capture the imagination of the Indian public. He says it is a shame that the Grand Prix is not happening in India next year. "I think Formula 1 is not very popular here. But the interest is growing among the media and the fans. "India is a very big market for Formula 1 and we should definitely be aiming to come back." F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone announced earlier this year that the 2014 Indian Grand Prix would have to be dropped to tweak the racing calendar. Reportedly, he could not agree on dates with the Indian organisers. F1 management "wanted us to hold the race in March", says Sameer Gaur, chief executive of Jaypee Sports International, which owns and operates the race circuit. "It was not practical to host one now and another in six months. "But there should be no doubt that we will be back in 2015," he says. However, India's motorsports industry has been speculating on a variety of reasons for the cancellation next year. The chief reason is what are seen as unfriendly government policies. The state government of Uttar Pradesh has refused to accept F1 as a sport and instead classifies it as entertainment. This means that organisers need to pay tax and duties on everything connected with the race. Fans too will have to pay entertainment tax on each ticket. So for the Indian infrastructure firm, Jaypee Group - of which Jaypee Sports International is a part - the F1 investment has not come cheap, and the organisers have already been struggling with rising costs and poor revenues. India's rupee has depreciated by over 40% in the past two years, and in August hit an all-time low against the dollar. The Buddh International Circuit is one of the few Formula 1 racetracks in the world that is not backed by government money. Other than the initial investment and operation costs, the venue needs to pay the F1 management an estimated licence fee of $40m annually. The revenues from TV rights and track sponsorships go to the F1 management directly. So the organisers mainly depend on revenues from ticket sales and while the inaugural race in 2011 drew in 95,000 fans, last year it was under 65,000. This year, the figures are estimated to be even lower. Indian Formula 1 driver Karun Chandhok says that while he can understand the government not being involved, "It'll be good if they didn't hinder the process. "Just this week, I have had at least 50 different media people from around the world, and people from teams, engineers who have called me to say, 'Hey, we are stuck in London without a visa, we can't come to the race.' "When you have 700 world media coming to talk about your country and about your race - the only thing they are going to go back with is what a pain it was to get into your country. "We need to iron out these things." In India, it is cricket that dominates the advertisers' wallets. But with number of sponsors growing every year, companies are finding it difficult to make their brand stand out. Last year, India's biggest telecom operator, Bharti Airtel, decided to drop its sponsorship for a cricket series in favour of the Grand Prix. So why is there a question mark hanging over the viability of motorsports here? Image consultant Dilip Cherian, who advises a number of firms on their investment in sports, says it would be judicious for F1 to keep its foot in India. But he too agrees that costs have gone up and large global markets are going through recession. "So while profits may be high, I don't think Indian corporates are paying enough to justify that kind of spend in India in the short run." There are already 22 possible races on the F1 calendar next year - making it one of the longest seasons ever. With Sochi in Russia and New Jersey in the US competing, many feel that once India loses its spot on the racing calendar, it will be tough to get it back. Driver Karun Chandhok points out that F1 is more than just a sport. It is a global calling card, he says, one that can open doors for Indian companies looking to gain an international foothold or for global companies entering the Indian market. "If we really want to help brand India, we need events like F1." So many are hoping that in spite of the break next year, Formula 1 will prove popular enough to get back on track in India soon. </body>

      <title>The older workers who keep going</title>
      <description>'I think I'd stagnate if I had to stay at home'</description>

      <body>As his 80th birthday approached, Bob Hooker decided to slow down a little. Instead of eight hours a day of painting and decorating, he asked his son and business partner if he could cut down a little - to just seven hours a day. But when big jobs needed to be finished, he still finds himself putting in extra hours up his ladder to get it done. "I think I'd stagnate if I had to stay at home," he says. "I feel sorry for people that have to retire." And a growing number feel the same way. According to official figures, there are 32,000 people in the UK who are in their 80s and still hard at work, a figure that has increased by more than half in the past 10 years. And as the post-war baby boom generation reach their mid-60s, it's becoming increasingly common to work past what used to be the official retirement age. Just over one million people are still working past the age of 65, and 324,000 of those are 70 and over. There are still some jobs you can't do. For example, the danger of sudden medical problems means that airline pilots cannot fly internationally past the age of 65, and if they are over 60, they must have a co-pilot who is under 60. But better lifestyles, better diets and better medicines mean that many people now reach their pension age in good health, with every chance of more healthy years ahead. Not everyone wants to fill those years with Bingo and bowls, though. For Bob, staying in work is not a problem, as he's his own boss. But for big employers, it's not so simple. The NHS is Europe's biggest employer, and it makes extensive use of older workers. In England there are 1,453 GPs, 1,207 hospital doctors and 14,816 nurses and support staff still practising past their 65th birthday. It's conducting an extensive review of the issues raised by working longer. Its research so far suggests that over-65s in good health are just as capable as their younger counterparts. Extending the working life of staff helps to fill skill shortages. But would older workers require easier shift patterns? Is that fair to their younger colleagues? And how do you evaluate if someone is no longer up to the job? These are all unanswered questions. The government is certainly keen to see more older workers. Compulsory retirement in the UK was abolished in 2011, and the state pension age is due to increase to 68 by 2048. As a nation, extending working lives is seen as a vital to keeping the country's pension system in balance - and if everyone worked for an extra year, it would add 1% to national income, according to government estimates. But many work longer because they need the extra money. Eddie Friel is a removal man from Glasgow. At the age of 68, he drives the length and breadth of Scotland, sometimes further afield, often sleeping in his van, and helping his colleagues load and unload. He loves his job, but he couldn't afford to retire. "I do need the money," he says. "If I'm left with my government pension and my company pension I have not got enough." The self-employed are particularly likely to be in this position. Some 47% of employees aged 60 to 64 are saving for a pension, but only 20% of the self-employed do. Many of those will reach 65 without enough money to fund the lifestyle they want. But if all these people are retiring later, are they taking jobs from the young? Eddie says he doesn't see a lot of young people wanting to do his physically demanding job. If he did, he'd be happy to go part-time to make way for them. There are obviously examples where an older worker occupies an individual position which another younger worker might want. And in 2011, a survey by the law firm Norton Rose found that more than a fifth of companies would find it harder to hire younger workers after the state retirement age was abolished. But older people in work will earn more, and spend more, creating extra economic activity. That should create employment opportunities for other workers, young and old. And many professions complain of a shortage of qualified staff. The Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development estimates that there will be nearly two vacancies created for each school or college leaver over the next 10 years. It's yet another reason why the number of people working past 65 has nearly doubled in the past 10 years. Government policy, demographics and business needs all seem likely to push that number even higher. And if current trends continue, there will soon be a lot more 80-year-olds up ladders like Bob Hooker. For many, the traditional idea of retirement is looking just a little old-fashioned. </body>

      <description>Cuts to further education budgets in Wales are "short-sighted" and could damage life-long learning, say teaching unions and charities.</description>

      <body>Cuts to further education (FE) budgets in Wales are "short-sighted" and could damage life-long learning, say teaching unions and charities. The Welsh government is proposing £44.9m of cuts in the FE sector next year and a further £42.5m the following year. The ATL teaching union said there would be a "devastating" impact. The Welsh government said it would work closely with colleges "to minimise the impact of any reductions on learning". Most of the proposed cuts will fall on post-19 further education, which is losing almost a quarter of a £160m budget. "We're talking about very positive things here, about courses which help with the difficult to reach, which help the Neets (not in education, employment or training), those who have been out of work for a long time, courses which help people to upskill and get better jobs," said Dr Phil Dixon from the ATL union. "And I think if those go, then a lot of people in the sector will be very demoralised." His concerns have been echoed by the University and College Union (UCU), which said colleges would struggle to deliver the level of services needed in Wales if the cuts went ahead. "The FE sector is a key player that should not be ignored," said a UCU spokesperson. "It provides a lifeline for many adults who want a second chance at education, enabling them to improve opportunities for themselves and therefore their children. "If reducing child poverty is a top priority for the Welsh government, the role that FE can play in this needs to be taken seriously and funded accordingly." Last year there were almost 250,000 learners in FE colleges in Wales, with three-quarters over the age of 19 and many studying part time. The colleges provide courses on a huge range of subjects including everything from basket weaving and brick laying to advanced manufacturing and engineering. Many of the courses are vocational but academic qualifications are also offered. The Welsh government's own analysis said the cuts would have a disproportionate impact on women, who are more likely to be adult learners, as well as those from an ethnic minority background. It also said it would make it more difficult for those who are out of work to re-train. The National Institute of Adult Continuing Education in Wales (NIACE) charity, said there were "wider benefits" in adult learning and now was not a time to cut the budget. "The effect of the cuts will be a reduction of the number of adult learners in Wales and NIACE Dysgu Cymru would advocate that at such a difficult time, we should be maintaining or even increasing funding for life-long learning for all sorts of reasons," said Essex Havard from NIACE. "There is a lot of research around the area of being an active learner and being a healthy adult, particularly in the area around mental health issues... adult learning can help people to get on with their lives after trauma, for example. "So these are the things we'd want to talk to the Welsh government about - about the wider benefits of adult learning, and of the wider impact of those cuts on the adult learning and life-long education budget." The Welsh government has protected provision aimed at 16-19 year olds, so post-19 further education will bear the brunt of the cuts. Around £37m is due to be cut from post-19 learning next year, a 23% reduction from its £160m budget. Responding to the criticisms about the cuts, the Welsh government said it had been "open about the stark reality" of the financial challenges being faced. "But as we work through these difficult times, it is ever more important that we focus not just on the resources that are available but how we use them and what we achieve," said a spokesperson. "We will work closely with the post-16 sector to evaluate available options and to minimise the impact of any reductions on learning. "This will be the case for any sector that may be impacted by reductions." </body>

      <body>A man wrongly convicted of murder has launched a High Court challenge over a decision not to charge a former police officer with perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Michael O'Brien and two other men spent 11 years in jail after they were wrongly found guilty of killing Cardiff newsagent Phillip Saunders, 52. Known as the Cardiff Newsagent Three, Mr O'Brien, Darren Hall and Ellis Sherwood, were jailed in 1988. They were cleared on appeal in 1999. Mr O'Brien applied for judicial review of a Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decision that there was insufficient evidence to charge retired Det Insp Stuart Lewis. The application is being heard at London's High Court by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, who is sitting with Mr Justice Irwin. Lord Thomas told Heather Williams QC, appearing for Mr O'Brien: "The key issue we have to consider is whether the decision that has been made by the CPS was one no reasonable prosecutor would have reached." Ms Williams is arguing the CPS decision was "perverse" because of a failure to take into account relevant matters and a flawed information-gathering process. Lord Thomas ruled that the press and media can report the fact that Mr O'Brien's application is being made to the court, but not the details of the case. Mr Saunders died five days after being attacked and robbed close to his home in Canton, Cardiff, in October 1987. He had returned home in his van after working at his newsagent kiosk at Cardiff bus station and suffered a fractured skull. The jailing of the Cardiff Newsagent Three for the killing is regarded as one of the country's most notorious miscarriages of justice cases. </body>

      <title>Boosting faith tourism 'challenging'</title>
      <description>Boosting faith tourism in Wales will be a challenge, the Welsh government admits as it launches its action plan.</description>

      <body>Boosting faith tourism in Wales will be a challenge, the Welsh government has admitted. Economy and Transport Minister Edwina Hart said attracting more visitors to places of worship and other sacred sites would give tourism a competitive edge. But she said increasing the £12m UK tourists already spend visiting faith venues would be difficult. It comes as the government launched its Faith Tourism Action Plan. Mrs Hart said the plan sets out a "challenging vision for exploiting the full potential of Wales places of worship". It said places of worship are already amongst the most visited attractions in Wales. Visit Wales figures showed tourists from across the UK spent £12m while visiting such venues in Wales in 2012. But the Welsh government said improving that figure would be hard because many places of worship are closed or appear closed to visitors; there is no coherence between faith tourism projects and no organisation adequately funded to promote it. The faith action plan, which was launched at St Asaph Cathedral in Denbighshire, is part of the government's wider tourism strategy. "This is the first action plan of its kind in the UK with a specific focus on faith tourism," Mrs Hart said. "Some of Wales' places of worship are truly iconic and attract huge numbers of visitors every year. This action plan will not only focus on the iconic sites. "Churches and chapels have a presence in every community and the activities within Wales' places of worship have helped shape its language, culture and way of life. Temples of all religions, holy sites and pilgrim trails also have their place." One element of the action plan is to develop a pilgrims' walking trail across south Wales to the cathedral. St Asaph Cathedral was chosen as the site for the launch of the action plan, which was welcomed by the Bishop of St Asaph, the Right Reverend Gregory Cameron. "Across this diocese we have holy sites and ancient places of worship which have been visited by pilgrims for generations and this initiative is a new opportunity to share our rich Christian heritage with locals and tourists alike," he said. A working group has been set up in order to achieve the objectives of the plan and their work will focus on promoting faith tourism, help tourism businesses to make the most of faith tourism. </body>

      <title>Call for shorter assembly holidays</title>
      <description>Assembly members should have shorter holidays and hold an extra meeting each week, says the leader of the Welsh Conservatives.</description>

      <body>Assembly members should have shorter holidays and hold an extra meeting each week, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives says. Andrew RT Davies told BBC Wales there should be a "root and branch review" of the way the assembly operates. AMs currently hold full sessions - to question ministers and pass legislation - on a Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon. Mr Davies said an extra session could be held on Thursday mornings but the Wales Governance Centre disagrees. A recent report said proper scrutiny of the Welsh government could be achieved by increasing the number of AMs from 60 to 100. But Mr Davies said the idea of increasing the number of AMs from the current total would be "jumping the gun". He said: "Now more than ever we need a root and branch review of procedure within the Welsh parliament. "Suggestions of an increase in AM numbers are jumping the gun. "There is far more that can be done with the current number of members, and we need to get that right first." The assembly took a 10-week recess this summer and after sitting for five weeks, next week is a one-week half-term recess. Mr Davies said: "The time members spend within their constituencies and regions is extremely important and paramount to our work, while many members must also travel long distances to and from parliament. "Finding the right balance then is clearly not easy but it must be done for the benefit of Wales. "All would agree that engagement with Wales' democratic institution is worryingly low, and I hope AMs of all parties will come together to consider how we can burst the Cardiff Bay bubble." But Dr Rebecca Rumbul, manager of the Wales Governance Centre at Cardiff University, disagrees with Mr Davies' idea. "There are not enough AMs to properly hold the government to account currently and I don't believe that simply shortening recess or making committee members sit in yet another meeting will be a high quality solution to that problem," she said. "Most AMs you speak to will work a 60 hour week. When they're on recess, they're not on a nine-week Caribbean cruise, they are in their constituencies working very hard to the people that have voted them in. "I don't think increasing the hours will produce the kind of high quality democracy what we want. "Actually what we want to see is a plurality of voices and an increase in experience in the assembly and you can only capture that by increasing the number of AMs." </body>

      <body>Changes to improve Powys council's services will have to be made more quickly because of the latest round of funding cuts, its cabinet says. The authority will see a £9m funding cut in 2014/15 and with £11m in increased service pressures, it said it is left with a £20m funding shortfall. Four main aspects are being looked at as part of the changes. They include changing the way it delivers services, management structures, and reducing service costs. "The latest budget news with its 4.6% cut in funding shows how essential it is that the transformation continues and accelerates," leader David Jones said. "Service demands are increasing, costs are rising and our funding is falling and without change we will not deliver." He added: "This approach will ensure that we have the right services where needed, that we build a sustainable and efficient delivery network with our partners where necessary and that our citizens feel engaged in their local services." Councils the length and breadth of Wales are trying to work out the best ways of dealing with unprecedented cuts. Funding for Ceredigion, Denbighshire and Powys will fall by 4.6% but Newport will only experience a 1.2% cut. Prior to the announcement earlier this month, the Welsh Local Government Association(WLGA) warned that most councils were unprepared for the scale of cuts. </body>

      <body>Police have ended their search for a man who sexually assaulted three girls in the pool of Swansea's main leisure centre. The girls - aged eight, nine and 15 - were targeted by a man in the LC in Oystermouth Road on 21 August. The centre was closed for a short time following the incident while police searched the premises, and detectives at South Wales Police have since studied CCTV footage. Officers said nobody had been found. "Despite an extensive investigation into allegations of indecent behaviour at the LC in Swansea in August, no culprit has been identified and in the absence of any new information the matter has been finalised," a spokesperson said. Nic Beggs, general manager of the LC, said extra CCTV had been installed since the incident and staff had received extra training from the police. He added: "We have been working closely with the police since this incident took place and we are clearly disappointed no one has been apprehended. "We take a zero tolerance approach to inappropriate behaviour and have made a number of improvements in recent months to increase customer safety." Officers described the suspect as tanned with collar-length brown hair, unshaven, and wearing black or blue knee-length board shorts. Anyone with any information should call Swansea Central CID on 01792 450618 or 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. </body>

      <title>Flood risk as more rain forecast</title>
      <description>Heavy rain could lead to more localised flooding in parts of Wales over the coming days, Natural Resources Wales warns.</description>

      <body>Heavy rain could lead to localised flooding in parts of Wales over the coming days, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) is warning. It follows a yellow 'be aware' alert on Friday morning for rain across much of south and south west Wales which was issued by the Met Office. NRW said the forecast for the whole of Wales remained unsettled for Sunday and Monday. Last weekend, downpours led to flash flooding in parts of Cardiff. "With ground remaining saturated from rainfall during the week, water may quickly find its way into streams, ditches and rivers with the potential for localised flooding," said a NRW spokesperson. "With leaves littering pavements and roads, there is also a risk that blocked drains will cause flooding of road surfaces, causing traffic disruption. "Officers will be monitoring river levels closely over the weekend, checking they are clear of blockages and making sure that flood defences are operating efficiently." The Met Office yellow warning for rain came into force just after midnight, and remains in place until 10:00 BST on Friday morning. It covers Cardiff, Swansea, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Newport, Merthyr Tydfil, Caerphilly, Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Vale of Glamorgan, Neath Port Talbot, Torfaen, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire. Forecasters say nearly an inch of rain (20mm) could fall as a band of heavy cloud moves north-east across southern Wales, with over an inch of rain (30mm) on higher ground. On Saturday, flash flooding in parts of Cardiff saw police close roads around Ely and Culverhouse Cross. Shoppers at the Marks and Spencer store in Culverhouse Cross had to be evacuated when water entered the shop, but some remained stranded in the car park for up to two hours. The nearby Tesco store also had to be evacuated due to flooding. NRW urged members of the public to "keep an eye" on weather forecasts over the weekend, and check flood alerts, which are updated every 15 minutes on its website. Updates are also available on the NRW Floodline on 0845 988 1188 and through NRW's Twitter account, @natreswales. </body>

      <title>Swansea draw a fair result - Laudrup</title>
      <description>Manager Michael Laudrup says his Swansea side's draw with Russian side Kuban Krasnodar is a fair result.</description>

      <body>Manager Michael Laudrup said Swansea's draw with Kuban Krasnodar was a fair result, despite the frustration of seeing his side concede a last-minute equaliser. Michu gave the Swans the lead before Djibril Cisse's penalty made it 1-1. The result meant Swansea dropped points for the first time in their debut Europa League campaign. "If you look at the game overall, I have to admit the draw was a fair result," said Laudrup Swansea remain top of Group A, one point ahead of Valencia with three games remaining. Laudrup has stated he believes 10 or 11 points will ensure they qualify for the knockout stages. The Dane conceded he was frustrated by his side's inability to hold on for maximum points but praised the Russians' performance. "When you are 1-0 up in injury-time and you have the ball, you think it's done," said Laudrup. "If you look at the way we conceded the goal - a penalty after a counter-attack in injury-time - it is frustrating. "We had a lot of possession, like we do, but we did not create that many chances. They were very dangerous on the counter-attack, which we knew before the game. "In the first half, they had three or four very dangerous counter-attacks. So overall a draw is fair." Laudrup refused to blame any of his players for the penalty, despite Jonjo Shelvey losing the ball in midfield and goalkeeper Gerhard Tremmel bringing down substitute Ibrahima Balde for the spot-kick. "We don't point fingers at anybody here," said Laudrup. "We are still learning and very few of my players have played international games. "Yes, we play in the Premier League but this is a process and I think this will give us a lot of experience. To get experience you have to make mistakes, but you learn from them." </body>

      <title>Extra funding for Wales from HS2</title>
      <description>Wales will receive tens of millions of pounds in extra funding as a result of the High Speed 2 rail link, the Treasury concedes.</description>

      <body>Wales will receive tens of millions of pounds in extra funding as a result of the High Speed 2 rail link, the Treasury has conceded. It had initially rejected Finance Minister Jane Hutt's announcement that Wales would get extra cash stemming from spending on the project in 2015. The Welsh government said it was "pleased the position is now clear". But the spending commitment of around £35m in that year is not guaranteed for the lifetime of the project. The Treasury suggested it may change the funding formula in the future. HS2 is a controversial new high speed rail link proposed to run from London to Birmingham from 2026, with branches to Manchester and Leeds via Sheffield planned for 2033, at an estimated cost of £42.5bn. UK government ministers have always maintained that the project is of UK-wide significance. This would mean the devolved nations should not get extra payments which are normally due to them for transport projects in England. The 2015 extra cash will put pressure on the Treasury to maintain the payments throughout the next decade - which could bring in up to £2bn for the Welsh budget. But the Chancellor is able to change the funding formula at his discretion, which means that in future years the system could be adjusted to exclude any additional cash for Wales. The Welsh government is likely to campaign strongly to continue to receive the extra funding beyond 2015. It confirmed it had received a share of £832m to be spent on the HS2 scheme by the Department for Transport in 2015-16. Speaking to BBC Wales on Thursday, Finance Minister Jane Hutt said the Welsh government was "very clear" on the matter. She said that this episode demonstrated how the way the Welsh government is funded "needs reform". The Welsh government receives a slice of the extra money that is spent in England on services that are devolved in Wales, such as health or education, what is known as "Barnett consequentials". That process would normally include transport spending, but Treasury officials had always maintained Wales would not get more cash as a result of extra spending on HS2 because they say the project benefits the entire UK. The issue of Wales receiving part of this money has been at the centre of a bitter political wrangle in recent years. Ms Hutt's statement to the assembly's finance committee on Monday - where she informed members of the extra cash coming to Wales - was welcomed as a breakthrough by campaigners from across the political spectrum. She told AMs there would be £84m extra in 2015-16, because of a £2bn increase in the Department for Transport's overall budget, which includes £832m spent on HS2. A Treasury spokesperson said the Welsh government had received a "capital consequential" of £84.5m. "This was based on a £2bn increase in the total Department for Transport capital budget," said the Treasury. Figures obtained by the BBC under a freedom of information request showed that Cardiff could potentially lose £70m in economic output once a high speed rail link opened between London and the north of England. </body>

      <title>Griffiths on Wales' World Cup chances</title>
      <description>Former Wales head coach Clive Griffiths thinks Wales can do well in the Rugby League World Cup, despite a likely opening onslaught from Italy</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/wales/24615347</url>

      <body>Clive Griffiths is a name synonymous with Welsh rugby league. The former St Helens player was in charge of Wales for two memorable World Cup campaigns in 1995 and 2000. Wales lost 25-10 to England in that 1995 semi-final and a side captained by Iestyn Harris gave Australia an almighty scare before losing 46-22 at the same stage five years later. Griffiths has also spent a spell as assistant to current head coach Harris, who has been in charge of the national side since 2009. Here, North Wales Crusaders head coach Griffiths looks forward to Wales' fourth World Cup campaign, which begins against Italy at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday. "Iestyn's still pretty young as a coach. He's very cool, as he was as a player. I get a bit more animated than Iestyn but we're all different in styles. "He knows the game inside-out and all he needs now is the coaching experience to go with it and the man-management skills which develop as you go along. "Iestyn is learning the hard way. The Crusaders was a tough baptism for him in their final season in Super League. I think he's done the right thing going to assist at Wigan Warriors. He couldn't be at a better rugby league club than Wigan and with time he will be one of the top coaches. "He's got a great chap assisting him in Lee Briers. They're two half-backs who know how the game should be played. "They've been in the fast lane of international rugby and Super League rugby for many a year so there are no better people to put forward that experience and the way of playing the game. "They gave me everything as players and I've got nothing but admiration for them. I've got no doubt these boys will go on to greater things." "There are more Super League players now in the Wales squad than there have been for a long time. It's similar to 1995, when we had players from throughout the game - the Warrington boys, the St Helens connection and the Widnes boys. "Players like Ben Flower and Gil Dudson (both Wigan Warriors) plus Jordan James (Salford Red Devils) are in the fast lane of forward play down the middle. You can see how they've come on as players since they moved up into the higher level. "They've got the foundation; they've got a good forward pack. Our half-backs, number nine and hooker need to guide us around the pitch and make sure everyone's going forward in the right manner. "We've got to keep everyone healthy. People are bound to get injured but we just want to try and get the best team out we possibly can for those games. "I know how fantastic it is to be involved [in the World Cup] and you've got to transfer that to the players. It will be special for them." "Italy will be absolutely buoyed by their 15-14 warm-up match win against England. I couldn't believe the result. "It's the best thing that could have happened to Wales because this could have happened to Wales in our first game. "Everybody now will be totally on their guard and ready for an onslaught from Italy and we'll have a bit more respect for them. "It's going to be a mouth-watering encounter. I still think Wales will win it, but I don't think it's going to be as easy as everyone thought initially. "I don't know how long Italy have been together but they've obviously got some good players in the right positions and they seemed to have gelled pretty quickly. "I think we'll beat the United States and the Cook Islands with something to spare. We played the Cook Islands in 2000 at the Racecourse in Wrexham on a filthy night. It was only 6-6 at half-time but we went away to win by 38-6 in the end and I think it will be a similar tale. "They got absolutely slaughtered by a New Zealand team that were missing five or six of their probable starting line-up. The signs aren't good for the Cook Islands. It will be physical but I think Wales will come through it." "There's no reason why we can't do well. They will get to the quarter-finals, I'm pretty sure of that. "England or Australia in the quarter-final at Wrexham is quite an incentive; the carrot's dangling for the players. You want to play the best as a player, and it's going to be interesting whoever we play in that quarter-final. "With a bit of luck and some good decisions going their way there's no reason why we shouldn't get to the semi-final. As you saw in 2000, anything can happen and it's all on the day. It's cup-tie rugby. We can but dream." Clive Griffiths was talking to BBC Wales Sport's Aled Williams. </body>

      <body>Plans to demolish the ITV Wales studios at Culverhouse Cross near Cardiff and build homes on the site have been rejected by councillors. There were proposals to build 243 new houses on the site but there were objections to the project. Vale of Glamorgan councillors narrowly rejected the application at a meeting on Thursday. ITV Wales wants to relocate to Assembly Square, next door to the Senedd building, in Cardiff Bay in 2014. The plans submitted by the broadcaster were recommended for approval by council officers, subject to a number of conditions including highway improvements and funding for schools and community facilities. But the chairman of the Vale of Glamorgan council's development committee, Councillor Frederick Johnson, has confirmed the committee narrowly rejected the application. A motion to defer the application for further talks with the developers was also rejected. Mr Johnson said he was disappointed with the outcome. "It's a sad day," he said. ITV Wales wants to relocate around 100 staff from Culverhouse Cross to Cardiff Bay by June next year. But some of the other media companies based at the Culverhouse Cross site have campaigned against the house building proposals. ITV Wales has been at Culverhouse Cross since 1984. </body>

      <body>A main road in Snowdonia closed after a landslip covered it in about 30 tonnes of debris has reopened. The A498 was shut both ways on Wednesday between Beddgelert and Penygwryd while the carriageway was cleared. Officers used specialised equipment to remove the debris from the road, which now has temporary traffic lights in place. The landslip happened following a prolonged spell of heavy rain. A spokesman for the council said: "As part of the initial safety works on the site, concrete safety barriers are being installed. "The traffic management system will remain in place until further stabilisation work is completed at the site. "The council is currently making attempts to contact the relevant landowner before these additional safety works are carried out." The council has also spoken to the organisers of the Snowdonia Marathon, which takes place in the area on Saturday, who say the route will not be affected. </body>

      <body>A man has been arrested on suspicion of indecent assault at children's homes in north Wales. The 66-year-old is being questioned in connection with offences against three boys, between 1975 and 1977, when they were aged between 10 and 14. The man was arrested in St Leonards on Sea, East Sussex, as part of Operation Pallial, the investigation into allegations of historical sexual abuse in the north Wales care system. He is the 13th person to be arrested. A 53-year-old man arrested by police on Wednesday, 16 October has been released on bail. The man, from Connah's Quay, was questioned about three alleged sexual offences in the 1980s involving a boy aged between 12 and 14. The National Crime Agency launched Operation Pallial last November to look at allegations relating to 18 care homes between 1963 and 1992. One person has so far been charged with a large number of serious sexual offences. </body>

      <body>A former mayor has been sentenced to 18 years in prison for a series of explosions in Denbigh which a neighbour described as sounding like a "battlefield". John Larsen, 46, got a "thrill" from his actions, which had the potential to kill, Caernarfon Crown Court was told. The explosions happened in the Lenten Pool area from January to April. In the most serious incident, he blew up a Land Rover, showered ball-bearings and shrapnel over a large area. Larsen was found guilty earlier on Thursday of three counts of arson, one of causing an explosion likely to endanger life and another of possessing explosives with intent to endanger life. Judge Merfyn Hughes QC said it was "a very unusual case and these are very serious offences". Larsen was mayor of Denbigh in 1999 and was a town councillor at the time of his arrest. The trial heard Lenten Pool was plagued by the sound of loud bangs, with incidents taking place two or three times a week culminating in a main attack on a Land Rover in March. Larsen was arrested by police at his nearby home on 19 April. North Wales Police found a manual on pyrotechnics in his house, a computer file named "gunpowder mix", modified fireworks and rockets, and ball-bearings. He told officers he had a legitimate interest in fireworks and had bought some materials online. But the court was told Larsen got a "thrill from what he was doing and the attention it was generating." Resident Shirley Clarke told the trial: "People often said they were fireworks - they were not fireworks. "They were humongous. They were more than fireworks, it was like a bomb." In evidence another neighbour, Trevor Jones, said the noise was like a battlefield - and the bangs and explosions became gradually louder, sounding like artillery fire. The blast under the Land Rover on 24 March showered ball-bearings and shrapnel over a large area, smashing windows. One resident found that a ball-bearing had hit a headboard on their bed. An explosives expert said the ball-bearings had either been packed or strapped onto the device and would have been ejected from the bomb at "several hundred metres per second" with the potential to cause serious injury or even death to any passers-by. Larsen denied the charges throughout his trial. The former stonemason, who stopped working in 2004 after injuring his back, said his hobbies were photography, fireworks and "hand magic". He said he made "fireworks, not bombs". Prior to his arrest, Larsen gave interviews to the media, including BBC Wales, saying how people were "terrified" by the "scary" the situation. After the hearing, Det Ch Insp Andrew Williams said: "During this period, John Larsen came to the fore as a local leader and the community trusted him. "He betrayed that trust in a terrible way and he now faces the consequences of his actions." </body>

      <body>The former chief executive of Wrexham FC, Paul Retout, has been given a 16-month jail sentence for a £60,000 fraud. Retout, 53, admitted submitting false invoices to London-based company Quadrangle Group in 2007 and 2008 while a partner with the firm. Kingston Crown Court heard that he had started at the group in 1989 as a financial controller. He stepped down from Wrexham football club in 2010. The court was told on Thursday that Retout made claims for work he had not done, blaming his "chaotic" family life after moving to north Wales. "You were not acting dishonestly from the outset, but you became dishonest when you later invoiced and obtained money for work you had not done and for which you were not entitled, money obtained from the partnership," Judge Nicholas Jones told Retout. The judge said he also accepted that the ex-football club boss, who had his family home in Ruthin in Denbighshire, had shown remorse for his actions. Retout is also expecting to be stripped of his professional standing as a chartered accountant, the court heard. He pleaded guilty to committing fraud by abuse of position at a court hearing last month. The court was told that Retout obtained £59,806 as result of his fake invoices, and also carrying out work which had not been authorised in advance by the firm. A civil legal case with Quadrangle has been settled, and Retout has also made part-repayment of the defrauded money. </body>

      <body>The proposed merger of two Denbighshire Catholic schools could be put on hold as councillors consider a new option. It had been proposed that St Brigid's in Denbigh and Blessed Edward Jones in Rhyl should close, to be replaced by a new multi-faith school on two sites. Instead, Denbighshire councillors will be asked to consider working with the Anglican and Catholic diocese to create a single site on an undecided location. The council's cabinet will vote on the proposal at a meeting next week. More than 1,300 people responded to a consultation, which showed very little support for the original proposals. A new, single site would mean the closure of both existing faith schools, possibly by 2018. Anna Gresty, of St Brigid's Action Group, said: "Having read the council's summary of responses to this consultation, we weren't surprised at the overwhelming response against the proposals to merge St Brigid's School and Blessed Edward Jones as one school 12 miles apart." Tony Hannigan, chair of governors at St Brigid's School, said: "St Brigid's School is very pleased to have been told in a meeting with Denbighshire County Council officers, that they have listened to our concerns and will recommend councillors drop plans for a 'one school on two sites' model involving St Brigid's and Blessed Edward Jones in 2014." However, he said there was concern that plans to build a new school, adding that it would "represent much greater value for money for the taxpayer to use the existing sites and build on their successes". Earlier this year, pupils at St Brigid's made on online film to campaign to keep the school as it is. </body>

      <body>A health trust has admitted failings in the care of an 18-year-old Kent student with a history of mental health problems who killed herself. Lauren Smith, of Canterbury, was found dead at the University in Wales Trinity St David's Lampeter campus in 2012. Her mother, Laura Smith, said she had been left "heartbroken" and did not want the situation to be repeated. Kent and Medway NHS Trust said a review found "more could have been done" to support her transfer to Wales. Lauren, who had a history of self-harming, was weeks into the first year of her humanities degree when she took her own life at the university halls of residence in Lampeter on 17 November 2012. Ceredigion coroner Peter Brunton recorded a verdict of suicide while suffering severe depressive illness, at an inquest into her death in Aberystwyth. The inquest was told she was not getting the mental health care she should have been receiving. Ms Smith said there was a lack of support for teenagers with a history of mental health and they were at risk of "slipping through the cracks" when they turned 18, left home or moved to university. She added: "I was given a false sense of security by assuming risk assessments were being carried out, that my concerns as her mother were being recorded, and that information and records were being shared between agencies. "There seems to be complacency among mental health professionals when it comes to adolescent mental health - for instance, I was told by one hospital psychiatrist that lots of teenage girls harm themselves, it doesn't mean they're going to do anything." She added: "There were many opportunities for the outcome to have been different for Lauren. "We will never know this for sure, but I hope that other vulnerable young people and their families can be spared the additional agony of what ifs? by ensuring that further deaths of those slipping through the cracks - as they transition between Child and Adolescent Mental Health and Adult Services - are prevented." A spokeswoman for Kent and Medway NHS Trust said: "Following Lauren's death the trust conducted an immediate review of the care provided. The initial investigation concluded that record-keeping in the case was below the expected standard and the arrangements for transferring care to Wales should have been better managed. "Further review has highlighted that more could have been done to gather information from other mental health services that had seen Lauren in the past." In a statement, Hywel Dda Health Board said it had contacted Ms Smith's family "to explain that the appropriate referral to local mental health services was made for Lauren whilst she was resident in our area". A spokesman for the University in Wales Trinity St David said it had a comprehensive range of support services for students in place, which included mental health advisers, mentors and counsellors. "These services are provided as soon as the university is made aware of any support needs that our students might have," he said. He added that the university students' union also provided a student welfare service and a night-time listening service. </body>

      <body>Villagers are concerned a planned pylon route linking wind farms to the national power supply could spoil the view from a local hill. Drop-in sessions are being staged by National Grid over the 25-mile (40km) route in Powys and Shropshire until 8 November. In Llanymynech, near Welshpool, people said they feared the pylons could ruin the views across the two counties. National Grid said it was "one of the main things" concerning people. A spokeswoman said National Grid "fully understands" people's concerns in Llanymynech, adding: "That's why we're holding these events, to hear people's opinions." The pylon route would start from an electricity sub-station in Cefn Coch, near Llanfair Caereinion, and finish at the national transmission network near Oswestry in Shropshire. In addition to the pylons, National Grid has said eight miles (nearly 13km) of cables will be buried underground in the Meifod valley. The first of 26 drop-in sessions in Powys and Shropshire started on 7 October. Revealing its pylon plans in September, National Grid said a new "T-pylon" - which is about 15m (nearly 50ft) shorter than conventional pylons - could be used along the power cable route which would be 33 miles (53km) long. It said it had developed a draft route to keep away from villages and would use "hills and trees as a natural backdrop to help keep any visual impact to a minimum". The remaining drop-in sessions start next week at West Felton Village Hall, near Oswestry, and at Meifod Village Hall, near Welshpool. </body>

      <title>Parents urged to act over measles</title>

      <body>Parents are being asked to urgently get their children vaccinated against measles to stop an outbreak of the disease spreading. Public Health Wales (PHW) said the number of cases linked to a Pontardawe school had risen to 13, while a case had been reported at a Swansea nursery. This outbreak comes less than four months after Wales' biggest measles outbreak ended - centred on the same area with 1,200 suspected cases. PHW said it was "very frustrated". "We now have cases not only in Cwmtawe school but also in two primary schools, a further education college and a nursery," said Dr Jorg Hoffmann, PHW's consultant in communicable disease control. "In all of these places there are unvaccinated children and young people who could easily catch and spread measles." Health officials have already written to all parents of unvaccinated children in Cwmtawe School to urge them to arrange for their children to be vaccinated. Pupils were offered the MMR vaccination with 55 children immunised during the school session but at least 46 did not take up the offer. Dr Hoffmann added: "We are very frustrated to see more cases of measles in the area so soon after the large outbreak earlier this year. "We are very keen for this to be stopped before it can get any bigger and we return to a position where children are admitted to hospital or die or are damaged by the disease. "The only way to achieve that is through vaccination and I urge parents whose children have not received two doses of MMR to ensure that they speak to their GP immediately to arrange this quick, safe and effective vaccine." The Swansea area epidemic lasted eight months with suspected cases first reported in November 12. By the time the outbreak was declared over in July, it had resulted in 1,219 notifications of measles cases in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas. Some 88 people visited a hospital due to measles during the outbreak and more than 75,000 were vaccinated throughout Wales. Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, from Swansea, died from pneumonia after contracting the virus at the height of the epidemic. The symptoms of measles include a fever, fatigue, runny nose, conjunctivitis and a distinctive red rash. </body>

      <title>Firms still failing over 'swaps'</title>
      <description>Welsh businesses are still failing six months after a scheme was set up to compensate them after being mis-sold financial products, claims an MP.</description>

      <body>Welsh businesses are still failing six months after a scheme was set up to compensate them after they were mis-sold financial products, claims an MP. Aberconwy Conservative MP Guto Bebb, who is leading a commons committee on the issue, said millions were being spent administering the scheme. But he said the money was not getting through to businesses which had suffered huge losses. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said cases were being speeded up. Victims claim they were not made aware of the risks of interest rate swap agreements (IRSAs) which are commonly known as swaps. "We still have businesses who are failing, not because they made the wrong decision but because they were mis-sold an inappropriate product and we really do need to get the FCA to simplify and move ahead at a much quicker pace," said Mr Bebb. About 40,000 businesses across the UK are thought to be affected. Some people attended a rally at Westminster before a Commons debate on the plight of small businesses on Thursday, including Pembrokeshire farmer Carwyn James who is owed £180,000 by Barclays. He is critical of the attitude of banks, not just for selling him the swap in the first place, but also for the way they kept on charging him extra banking fees while he was in trouble. "There was conscious process of piling it on, waiting for us to pop," Mr James said. "A short-term money-making attitude, that is the worst thing they have done, instead of helping businesses they finished them. We were at their mercy and it was open season." In response, Barclays said it had built a quick and clearly defined "consequential loss assessment process" which was now in full swing. "If a customer submits a claim within 40 days of their redress offer, we will review and provide them with a final redress offer within 28 days of receipt of their claim," said Barclays. "We would encourage those who haven't yet responded to do so shortly so that their reviews can commence." Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Wales spokesman Iestyn Davies said the swaps mis-selling put businesses under an unbearable strain when they were also struggling with the recession. "Businesses have closed, they've gone to the wall and failed. "But, more importantly, individuals' health has suffered, relationships have suffered and there has been lasting damage done as well to the credibility banks have as trusted advisors to small businesses," he said. "These actions were immoral they were probably illegal but more importantly they are things which have caused people to be damaged as individuals. "We need them to have the redress they deserve to be put back in the position they were in before these products were sold to them." The FCA said cases it hoped most would be reviewed by the end of the year. It said it was encouraged that some banks announced this week they would start paying compensation in separate stages - effectively fast tracking compensation payments. </body>

      <title>Broadband firm grants suspended</title>
      <description>Grants to help people sign up for broadband with a Carmarthenshire firm are suspended after complaints about a patchy service.</description>

      <body>Grants to help people sign up for broadband with a Carmarthenshire firm have been suspended. It follows complaints from ResQNet customers that they had been left with a patchy and inconsistent service. The Cross Hands company has received almost £900,000 in public cash from a government scheme to provide high-speed internet access in so-call 'not-spots'. ResQNet vowed to upgrade its network by the end of October. Grants for other broadband providers are not affected. The firm received funding as part of the Wales Broadband Support Scheme, which makes £1,000 grants available to households unable to access broadband connections. The money is typically paid directly to suppliers, so residents do not have to pay up front for equipment and connection costs. Customers from various parts of Carmarthenshire have told BBC Wales they were promised broadband connection speeds of around 5Mbps by ResQNet, but say they have faced a disrupted and a patchy service in recent months. John Sydney, from Taliaris near Llandeilo, said he had now cancelled his subscription to ResQNet because of his frustration with the service. He said he was pleased with the internet speed initially being provided by ResQNet, but then the broadband connection deteriorated around six months ago. "We've had very, very slow speeds and a lot of disconnections," he said. "It's on and off all the time. All of a sudden you couldn't do things online... it was quite frustrating." He said the Welsh government "should be checking on the supplier... to make sure he's fulfilling his part of the contract". Another customer, Roger Thomas, from Cwmdu near Llandeilo, has gone back to using an old, and slower service, because he said ResQNet was too unreliable. "£24 pounds a months is a lot of money for a service that doesn't work," he said. BBC Wales has been made aware of more problems with services in the village of Llanedi, between Cross Hands and Pontarddulais. ResQNet's own website indicates a series of technical problems and upgrades to the service, while a Facebook page has been set up by frustrated ResQNet customers. The company declined to be interviewed by BBC Wales, but in a statement said work would soon be completed to increase network capacity and upgrades to the wireless network. ResQNet director Clive Downey said that the internet usage they were experiencing was "was way beyond what we expected". In its statement, the company added: "We appreciate there have been service issues on parts of our network due to the increased need for bandwidth combined with the success of the service. "The planned increase in the capacity of the network has been delayed but its implementation by the end of October will help alleviate the current issues for the customers affected. ResQNet said it was a "small, innovative business" that over the last two-and-a-half years had provided broadband services where other "major players have failed". "We are committed to continue this trend and overcome the obstacles that will come along from time to time by continued investment and innovation and provide broadband users in west Wales with real choices," it added. "We are also more aware of its limitations and our business strategy will now reflect this new found knowledge whilst being very aware of the importance this service is to the areas concerned. The company said customers affected by the current issues would be compensated under the terms of their contract, and some had already been paid. The Welsh government said it was "unacceptable" that customers had been let down, after it had paid £892,000 in grants to residents and businesses who had identified ResQNet as their broadband service provider. A Welsh government spokesperson said it was working with ResQNet to ensure it fulfilled contractual obligations, adding that there was a "mechanism to recover funding under certain circumstances". </body>

      <title>Greenpeace piracy charges 'dropped'</title>
      <description>Greenpeace activists held in Russia over a protest against Arctic oil drilling face lesser charges of hooliganism rather than piracy, officials say.</description>

      <body>Russia has dropped piracy charges against 30 Greenpeace activists, replacing them with hooliganism charges, according to officials. The new charge has a maximum penalty of seven years rather than 15. Greenpeace says it is still "wildly disproportionate". Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise vessel was seized by Russian forces as activists tried to scale an offshore oil platform. All 30 people on board were detained. Two of them are freelance journalists. So far all bail applications in the case have been refused. Vladimir Markin, the head of Russia's main investigating agency the Investigative Committee, told Russian news agencies that the charges had been reclassified. But the investigators did not rule out more serious charges at a later date - in particular the use of violence against officials. The refusal of the detainees to give evidence also gives the authorities reason to consider other offences such as terrorism and espionage, Mr Markin said. Last week, 11 Nobel prize-winners wrote to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to drop the charges of piracy. The presidential press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said the president had no power to influence the courts. Mr Putin said last month that the activists had violated international law but it was "absolutely evident that they are, of course, not pirates". Vladimir Chuprov of Greenpeace Russia said that there was no case for either piracy or hooliganism charges. "The Arctic 30 are no more hooligans than they were pirates," he said in a statement. "This is still a wildly disproportionate charge that carries up to seven years in jail. It represents nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest." Earlier Greenpeace Russia programme director Ivan Blokov told the Interfax news agency he was surprised the Russian government had refused to attend international court hearings in Germany over the detentions. The Netherlands took the case of the Dutch-flagged ship and its crew to the UN tribunal in Hamburg on Monday. The Russian foreign ministry released a statement pointing out that Moscow had opted out of UN Law of the Sea dispute procedures, which infringe upon sovereignty, in 1997. All 30 people who were on board the ship are in pre-trial detention in the northern port city of Murmansk until late November. They have complained of being held in harsh conditions, They were detained when Russian security sources stormed the ship five weeks ago following a protest against drilling for oil in the Arctic. Greenpeace denies any wrongdoing and is calling for the release of the detainees, who come from 18 countries, and the Arctic Sunrise. </body>

      <body>Head coach Iestyn Harris says Wales will have to be at their best to beat Italy in their opening game of the Rugby League World Cup on Saturday. The Italians beat England 15-14 at the weekend and Harris said the result should serve as a warning to Wales for the game at the Millennium Stadium. He said: "We knew about the quality of the Italians and we knew they would be a formidable task in our first game. "I think the result they had against England confirmed that." The Group C/D match will be Wales' third game at stadium where they the lost to New Zealand in the 2000 World Cup and then again in 2002. "Italy are a very, very good team and they've got a lot of experience in there [and] they've got a lot of NRL experience in there," added Harris. "They are an extremely difficult team to play against and anything outside our best won't be good enough to win that game." England face Australia in Saturday's opening game of the tournament in Cardiff followed by Wales' clash with Italy. Harris is relishing a return to the venue and says a successful World Cup campaign could help the game's popularity in Wales. "To have a game at the Millennium Stadium for a Wales rugby league national side is certainly important to us," Harris said. "I'm sure the players who take the field will be immensely proud of the fact we're at the Millennium Stadium. "If we hit the ground running and get some momentum behind us then all of a sudden the Welsh public will start to get behind us. "That could kick off the sport [and] ultimately we've got that responsibility." </body>

      <title>'Devastating' college cuts warning</title>
      <description>Cuts to further education budgets in Wales are "short-sighted" and could damage life-long learning, say teaching unions and charities.</description>

      <body>Cuts to further education (FE) budgets in Wales are "short-sighted" and could damage life-long learning, say teaching unions and charities. The Welsh government is proposing £44.9m of cuts in the FE sector next year and a further £42.5m the following year. The ATL teaching union said there would be a "devastating" impact. The Welsh government said it would work closely with colleges "to minimise the impact of any reductions on learning". Most of the proposed cuts will fall on post-19 further education, which is losing almost a quarter of a £160m budget. "We're talking about very positive things here, about courses which help with the difficult to reach, which help the Neets (not in education, employment or training), those who have been out of work for a long time, courses which help people to upskill and get better jobs," said Dr Phil Dixon from the ATL union. "And I think if those go, then a lot of people in the sector will be very demoralised." His concerns have been echoed by the University and College Union (UCU), which said colleges would struggle to deliver the level of services needed in Wales if the cuts went ahead. "The FE sector is a key player that should not be ignored," said a UCU spokesperson. "It provides a lifeline for many adults who want a second chance at education, enabling them to improve opportunities for themselves and therefore their children. "If reducing child poverty is a top priority for the Welsh government, the role that FE can play in this needs to be taken seriously and funded accordingly." Last year there were almost 250,000 learners in FE colleges in Wales, with three-quarters over the age of 19 and many studying part time. The colleges provide courses on a huge range of subjects including everything from basket weaving and brick laying to advanced manufacturing and engineering. Many of the courses are vocational but academic qualifications are also offered. The Welsh government's own analysis said the cuts would have a disproportionate impact on women, who are more likely to be adult learners, as well as those from an ethnic minority background. It also said it would make it more difficult for those who are out of work to re-train. The National Institute of Adult Continuing Education in Wales (NIACE) charity, said there were "wider benefits" in adult learning and now was not a time to cut the budget. "The effect of the cuts will be a reduction of the number of adult learners in Wales and NIACE Dysgu Cymru would advocate that at such a difficult time, we should be maintaining or even increasing funding for life-long learning for all sorts of reasons," said Essex Havard from NIACE. "There is a lot of research around the area of being an active learner and being a healthy adult, particularly in the area around mental health issues... adult learning can help people to get on with their lives after trauma, for example. "So these are the things we'd want to talk to the Welsh government about - about the wider benefits of adult learning, and of the wider impact of those cuts on the adult learning and life-long education budget." The Welsh government has protected provision aimed at 16-19 year olds, so post-19 further education will bear the brunt of the cuts. Around £37m is due to be cut from post-19 learning next year, a 23% reduction from its £160m budget. Responding to the criticisms about the cuts, the Welsh government said it had been "open about the stark reality" of the financial challenges being faced. "But as we work through these difficult times, it is ever more important that we focus not just on the resources that are available but how we use them and what we achieve," said a spokesperson. "We will work closely with the post-16 sector to evaluate available options and to minimise the impact of any reductions on learning. "This will be the case for any sector that may be impacted by reductions." </body>

      <body>The National Eisteddfod should continue to travel around Wales, says a task force that has been considering its future. Chaired by broadcaster Roy Noble, the group of 12 members opposed the festival establishing permanent bases. But their report said each eisteddfod should "experiment, better reflecting the area it is visiting". Eisteddfod chief executive Elfed Roberts welcomed the report and said it would be considered carefully. The National Eisteddfod is one of Europe's largest cultural and artistic festivals. Established by the Welsh government in 2012, the task-and-finish group looking at the event's future included Hay Festival director Peter Florence and Lord Dafydd Elis-Thomas AM. The biggest proposed change would have meant having a four-year cycle for the festival. In two of the years it would have been held in two different permanent bases, while during the other two years it would continue as now moving between north and south Wales to temporary homes. During this year's eisteddfod in Denbighshire, First Minister Carwyn Jones and Welsh Secretary David Jones both publicly supported the idea that it should remain a travelling festival. The report came to the same conclusion but recommended the appointment of a new artistic director "to attract visitors from all corners of the world". The eisteddfod receives about £500,000 from the Welsh government towards the £3.6m cost of staging the event. Mr Roberts said: "We welcome the publication of the group's report and will consider its content carefully. "This is an independent report on the eisteddfod, commissioned by the former minister for education and skills, and we look forward to receiving the government's response to its content and recommendations in due course. "This response and the report itself will be presented to the management board and the council of the eisteddfod, and following internal discussions we will publish our response to the report." </body>

      <title>Whistle-blowers 'put off' by policy</title>
      <description>Doctors believe the Welsh NHS's new whistle-blowing policy is deterring people from raising concerns about poor care.</description>

      <body>Doctors believe the Welsh NHS's new whistle-blowing policy deters health staff from raising concerns about poor care, BBC Wales has learned. The All Wales Whistle-blowing Policy was published in July after Health Minister Mark Drakeford said he wanted people to feel able to voice concerns. But the British Medical Association called the policy complicated and could leave people confused or threatened. The Welsh government said it would review it before the end of March 2014. Mr Drakeford's decision to bring in the policy was part of a package of measures aimed at preventing any Welsh equivalent of the Stafford Hospital scandal in England, where hundreds of patients died as a result of neglect and abuse. A public inquiry led by Robert Francis QC accused health service managers of putting corporate self-interest ahead of the interests of patients. In July Mr Drakeford said he wanted a "culture of conversation" in the health service in Wales "where people feel able to voice concerns about care and know they are being heard". But Phil Banfield, chair of the the British Medical Association's Welsh council, said the All Wales Whistle-blowing Policy focused on process rather than encouraging openness and transparency. "That's a problem for us because it seems to threaten disciplinary action if the process is not followed," he told BBC Wales. "It is our experience in different organisations that people who raise concerns fear for their future in the organisation. That is getting worse not better. "The emphasis on following procedure and being disciplined if procedure is not followed really worries our members. "We've had various members raise concerns over patient safety where they say they have talked to the management structure and the concerns have not been addressed. "In fact they've been made to feel trivialised by raising the concerns." Cathy James, chief executive of the campaigning charity Public Concern at Work, said: "I think the main concern is it's not clear who the policy is aimed at. "The main thing with a whistle-blowing policy is to make it very, very clear that you want to hear from staff and that you will protect them when they raise that concern and that doesn't come across loud and clear in this policy. "I'm also worried about the duty to raise concerns that's imposed in the policy. "That causes more problems than it solves because you're putting people in a really difficult situation and that's not the way to encourage people to speak up." The Welsh government said it was committed to NHS Wales' continued development of "an open and transparent culture, where staff feel confident to raise concerns locally as they occur". It said the policy was developed in partnership with the NHS, trade unions and approved by the Welsh Partnership Forum. A spokesperson said: "All health boards were asked to adopt the policy, which encourages staff to report concerns and details how an individual can raise concerns via a number of avenues. "The Welsh government has previously instructed NHS organisations to ensure that whistle-blowing policies are in place to enable staff to raise concerns internally. "Harassment or victimisation of anyone raising a genuine concern will not be tolerated." A spokesman for Healthcare Inspectorate Wales welcomed the policy and said healthcare organisations need to do everything possible to listen to the concerns raised by their staff. "Organisations should develop a culture which supports staff and ensures that positive action is taken where concerns are raised," he added. </body>

      <body>Wales and British and Irish Lions scrum-half Mike Phillips's future at French club Bayonne is in doubt. Bayonne say no decision has been taken yet on Phillips' future following an alleged breach of discipline. The club have also condemned  media reports in France  claiming the 31-year-old player had been sacked. Phillips apologised in French to Bayonne fans "for this situation" on his Twitter account on Thursday evening. The player added: "I am behind the team wholeheartedly tomorrow night. Good luck." Bayonne host Montpellier in the Top 14 on Friday evening. Phillips appeared before the Bayonne board on Tuesday to answer allegations he turned up to a video analysis session under the influence of alcohol. Fellow players Dwayne Haare and Stephen Brett also had to answer allegations at that meeting, and were fined but not suspended. National coach Warren Gatland has said the 77-times capped player will not face punishment by Wales. Phillips was suspended by Bayonne last year, for off-field misconduct, and by Wales in July 2011 following an incident in Cardiff city centre when he was involved in a confrontation with a doorman. The former Scarlets, Cardiff Blues and Ospreys player joined Bayonne following the World Cup in the autumn of 2011. He was a key member of the Lions team that beat Australia 2-1 in the Test series last summer, setting up the opening try for Alex Corbisiero in the decisive third-Test victory in Sydney. Phillips also won Six Nations Grand Slams with Wales in 2008 and 2012. </body>

      <body>Welsh flyweight Andrew Selby had to settle for a bronze medal at the World Championships after losing his semi-final to Uzbekistan's Jasurbek Latipov. England middleweight Anthony Fowler was withdrawn from his semi-final in Almaty because of a hand injury. The home nations' tally of two bronze medals compares to three silver and one bronze in 2011. Jason Quigley became the first Irishman to reach a world final by defeating Russia's Artem Chebotarev. Donegal boxer Quigley will take on home favourite Zhanibek Alimkhanuly in the middleweight final on Saturday. Westmeath's Joe Ward boxes Cuba's Julio Cesar la Cruz for a place in the light-heavyweight final later on Friday. Double European champion Selby, 25, was left heartbroken at the World Championships two years ago when he lost his final by a point. And the Barry man, the top seed, was unlucky again in Almaty, having looked to have done enough to beat fourth seed Latipov. Unseeded Liverpudlian Fowler, 22, was to have fought home fighter Zhanibek Alimkhanuly in his semi-final. But he suffered a heavily bruised right hand in his quarter-final win over German Stefan Haertel. "I am absolutely gutted, I felt I could have gone all the way," said Fowler, who damaged the same hand in 2012. </body>

      <body>Swansea defender Neil Taylor insists the club are not yet thinking about the first Welsh Premier League derby against Cardiff City on 3 November. He said the players are concentrating on ending a busy nine days with a home win against West Ham United on Sunday. The Swans beat Sunderland 4-0 last weekend and drew 1-1 in Europe with Kuban Krasnodar on Thursday. "Cardiff will take care of itself. We need to get a result against West Ham," said the left-back. "This week is a big week for us and we need to get seven points from the week." On the Cardiff game he added: "I've got to be honest [now the Cardiff game has been mentioned] it's the only time I've remembered it. That's the truth!" With Ashley Williams again missing with an ankle injury and Ben Davies also sidelined for three to four weeks, Taylor captained the Swans against Russian outfit Kuban Krasnodar in the Europa Cup. Swansea went 1-0 up and looked set to win until Djibril Cisse's injury-time penalty denied Swansea all three points. "We just didn't get the result we wanted," admitted Taylor. "When the the clock hits 90 minutes and you are 1-0 up you should see the game out really." Taylor admitted that he is still not 100% match fit. He suffered multiple fractures and a dislocation to his ankle in September 2012 and then was out with a dead leg for four weeks. "I'm getting there. I don't feel as tired towards the end of 90 minutes as I did. The sharpness is still got to come," he said. "I've got to get into the gaffer's [manager Michael Laudrup] way of playing. Hopefully I can get up to speed quickly. "Between [Ben Davies and myself] we are going to have a lot of games to play this season. "These knocks are going to happen. Ash [Williams] has got his first injury since I have been at the club for four and a half years. Hopefully Ash is back soon." But Swansea boss Laudrup said he was unsure whether Williams would be fit for the West Ham game. "It's too early. I don't want to to say anything about Ashley. I don't want to push him," he added. </body>

      <description>Acting, not singing, role of Britain's Got Talent winner</description>

      <body>James Corden talks about bringing Britain's Got Talent winner Paul Potts to the big screen, singing with Keira Knightley and his admiration for Meryl Streep. Corden admits he had his doubts about playing talent show contestant-turned-opera singer Potts in his new film One Chance. "I think my reaction was the same as everyone else's when they hear there's a Paul Potts film," laughs Corden. "I was like 'Really? Are you sure this is a good idea?" But after director David Frankel, of The Devil Wears Prada fame, convinced him the film would focus on the build-up to that famous audition - Potts' journey from a bullied, opera-obsessed young boy to a YouTube sensation - he was in. "It's a sports movie basically, where the sport is... opera," says Corden. Potts was a mobile-phone salesman when he entered and won the first series of reality show Britain's Got Talent in 2007, and the film uses footage of judges Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden and Piers Morgan's genuine reactions to that "watercooler moment". It also boasts British talent such as Julie Walters and Colm Meaney as Paul's parents, MacKenzie Crook as his friend (and manager in Carphone Warehouse) and Alexandra Roach as his love interest. Corden had to practise wearing his clip-in fake "Paul Potts teeth" for six weeks to conquer any lisping - Potts famously got his fixed with his BGT prize money - but they were "tremendously useful" for getting into character. Pulling off Potts' operatic singing voice proved a bit more challenging. "When I said yes to the film I was a little bit bullish and thought, 'I can do this'," reveals Corden. "So they got me some singing lessons with this brilliant teacher in New York. After about eight or nine lessons some producers came down to hear my opera. "I got about a third of the way through Nessun Dorma and they just went, 'Yeah we're going to get someone else to do this'. It wasn't great." So Corden sang "with the micrrophone turned off" during filming, "and then Paul sort of synched to my lips really". "We were all a little bit worried - will it work, will they buy it?" admits Corden. "Actually you kind of do." The film is backed by Hollywood heavyweight producer Harvey Weinstein, who Corden is said to have impressed while on stage in last year's hit play One Man, Two Guvnors. But he's quick to rubbish internet rumours that Weinstein will be running any sort of Oscar campaign for him. "For this?" he laughs. "I would be very surprised, I can't imagine that will be anywhere close to the case. "We've made a really nice, light, humorous film and I'm immensely proud of it, but I think you can start to get ever so slightly carried away with those sorts of things and I'm definitely not, in any way." It must be hard for Corden to keep his feet on the ground though, when he is currently turning up to work at Shepperton Studios with the likes of Johnny Depp and Meryl Streep. Nine director Rob Marshall has cast him in "a dream of a role", as The Baker in a big-budget film version of Broadway musical Into the Woods. "It's certainly the biggest thing I've ever done. It's ridiculous, I spent a long time just waiting to be fired really," says Corden. "I thought someone would go, 'This is silly, we should get someone who's actually famous'." But he's still in the job, along with Chris Pine, Anna Kendrick and Emily Blunt. However it is Streep who has really impressed him. "I would be a robot if it didn't affect me, I think she's probably the greatest actress alive," he says enthusiastically. "But (the reason) she's so incredible, is that she's just so unbelievably welcoming and encouraging and puts you at ease. (She is) a team player, she encourages a company spirit. I genuinely can't speak highly enough about her." Having misspent some of his youth in various, slightly dubious boybands, Corden can actually hold a tune. He'll be doing so in Into the Woods and alongside Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo in another film, Can a Song Save Your Life?, due out next year. "I play Keira's old friend from home who's a struggling musician in New York. I sing, but I'm not - there's a pattern emerging here - I sing but I'm not very good," he laughs. "Keira's really got the best songs in it - her voice is unbelievable, genuinely. People are going to be so shocked when they hear it. I think it's her best performance. "It's written and directed by John Carney who made the film Once, which I'm a huge fan of. I'm very proud to be in it," says Corden. In fact, these days Corden seems rightly proud of all his work. With flops like Lesbian Vampire Killers and his ill-fated sketch show Horne and Corden better left out of it, he currently has his fingers in many successful pies. New BBC Two comedy The Wrong Mans is a return to form for the Gavin and Stacey co-creator - currently enjoying positive viewing figures and favourable reviews. And co-written with Mathew Baynton, it gives him the chance to do what he likes best: "Being at the seed of an idea, and writing it and shooting it and editing it seeing it through. That is probably where I'm probably most creatively fulfilled." There's also hosting Sky One sports quiz A League of Their Own, and another year of the Brit Awards in 2014 before he hands hosting duties over to "someone younger and better looking". His plans to return to the stage - "I think in 2015" - sound like they've been mapped out with precision, but Corden denies that is the case. "I've never really had a career plan, which I'm sure won't come as a shock to anyone," he says. "Mainly my plan is to have fun and enjoy it. I couldn't think of anything worse than not enjoying it really." </body>

      <title>Campaigners press PM over cold homes</title>
      <description>Campaigners write to David Cameron demanding action on the "national crisis" of cold homes, as people are advised to keep houses well heated.</description>

      <body>Fuel poverty campaigners have written to Prime Minister David Cameron demanding cross-party action on the "national crisis" of cold homes. Campaigners said the UK was second only to Estonia for people struggling to pay their energy bills across Europe. It came as Public Health England urged people to keep their homes well heated this winter to avoid potentially fatal health problems. It said living rooms should be 21C (70F) and other home areas 18C (65F). Campaign group Energy Bill Revolution - an alliance of charities including Age UK and Barnardos - said the biggest problem in the UK was "leaky homes" and called for investment in a domestic insulation programme. Energy Bill Revolution said "woeful" levels of insulation had left Britain falling way behind comparable European countries such as Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands. Campaign director Ed Matthew said: "Our political leaders are falling over themselves to come up with headline-grabbing ways to cut energy bills yet they fall woefully short of a true solution to the energy bill crisis. "By far the biggest opportunity to cut energy bills is to fully insulate the UK's leaky homes. No other investment can do so much for so many. If the government is serious about solving this crisis they must make insulating homes the UK's number one infrastructure priority." Public Health England's advice came in its Cold Weather Plan for 2013, after four of the big six energy companies announced price rises. Age UK said older people in particular were increasingly anxious about the cost of heating their homes. Winter health risks range from flu to falls - but the cold can also make heart and respiratory problems much worse. On average there are about 24,000 excess winter deaths in England each year, many of which experts say are preventable. The plan has been produced in collaboration with the Department of Health, NHS England and the Local Government Association. It contains advice for the NHS and local government, as well as individuals. This includes having your flu vaccination if you are in an at-risk group, ensuring homes are properly insulated and making sure heating systems are routinely checked. From November, the Met Office will issue cold weather alerts if the temperature dips to 2C (35F) or less, or if there is severe winter weather such as heavy snow or widespread ice. Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection and medical director at Public Health England, said: "In colder weather, keeping yourself warm is essential to staying healthy, especially for the very young, older people or those with a chronic condition such as heart disease and asthma." Public health minister Jane Ellison said: "The elderly and those with long-term illnesses are particularly at risk during winter months so it's crucial that people stay warm." Age UK's charity director Caroline Abrahams said: "Being cold is a huge health risk for older people so it is absolutely essential that older people stay warm during the winter months. "But with fuel poverty blighting the lives of millions of households in the UK many older people are feeling increasingly anxious about the rising cost of energy. "The government must show it has a clear long-term plan to make low income homes more energy efficient." Labour's shadow energy and climate change minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: "People are being left in real hardship because David Cameron won't stand up to the energy companies. "Britain's energy is market is not working for families and business." </body>

      <title>Surgery offer for ex-'fattest man'</title>
      <description>A US surgeon offers to remove excess skin from a British man once dubbed the world's fattest.</description>

      <body>A plastic surgeon in the US has offered to operate on a British man once dubbed the world's fattest. At his heaviest, Paul Mason weighed 70 stone (444kg) and was bed bound at his bungalow in Ipswich, Suffolk. He now weighs about 24 stone (152kg) after gastric bypass surgery in 2010 but says his life is being hampered by a huge amount of excess skin. New York-based surgeon Dr Jennifer Capla said she was willing to donate her time to help Mr Mason. In May, Mr Mason, 52, released photographs of his naked body as part of his plea for medical help. Mr Mason said he had begun trying to raise the money to pay for flights and a hospital stay in order to take advantage of Dr Capla's offer. Dr Capla told BBC Radio Suffolk she had read about Mr Mason and his weight loss in the New York Times. "He is a high-risk patient and he has a lot of medical issues that we need to sort through," she said. "However, he's a great candidate for this skin removal surgery. "He has lost over 600lbs (272kg) and he should be very functional and mobile and should be able to live his life but he's still wheelchair-bound because he has all this excess skin. "Helping him get his life back is really the goal." Dr Capla said she specialised in "post-bariatric body contouring" but that although she had treated patients who has lost up to 200lbs (90kg) she had never treated anyone who had lost as much weight as Mr Mason. "The skin is the same in terms of looseness and the areas of target so it's an area I'm very familiar with," she said. Mr Mason said he had "things in motion" to raise the money needed. "All I've got to cover is the medication, the stay in hospital and the flights," she said. Mr Mason has not been able to have the surgery on the NHS because his weight has not been stable. He said an operation to remove excess skin around his middle would make a huge difference. "I would be able to mobilise and lead a reasonably normal life, then have my arms and legs done," he said. "Five years down the road it would possibly have to be repeated because by then I should be at my goal weight and the excess skin I would have then would still need removing because of the extreme size I was in the first place." A spokesman for the NHS Ipswich and East Suffolk Clinical Commissioning Group said: "Before a patient has an operation it is important to take a balanced decision that is in the best interest of that patient. "In cases like this the NHS has a panel of people - including clinicians - who decide whether the patient should have such an operation. A patient must have a stable weight before he or she is considered." </body>

      <title>Women 'stigmatised' over infertility</title>
      <description>Women feel judged for not having children or leaving it later in life to try, suggests research by Infertility Network UK - and might put off seeking fertility help.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24652861</url>
      <date>1382687171</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70697000/jpg/_70697517_couple_in_consultation-spl.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>New research suggests that many women aged 35-45 who do not have children feel judged for not having had a baby. Even if they plan to have a child, nearly 60% have at some point felt stigmatised for leaving it late. About 40% are too embarrassed to talk about fertility, especially with family and friends, often the biggest source of pressure. Susan Seenan from Infertility Network UK says this prevents some women from seeking help for fertility problems. The organisation, which interviewed 500 women for its survey, said it was a common problem. "Trying for a baby is a very personal thing which people don't always want to talk about, but there is constant pressure from families saying 'Isn't it about time...?'," said Ms Seenan. "And if you don't say anything, then friends and family assume you like your lifestyle too much to be bothered about children." If women are then diagnosed with fertility problems, the sense of isolation can become even worse, she says. "Unfortunately, infertility is still a taboo subject. When women are labelled as infertile they feel a failure, because they have let themselves and their partner down. "Their basic biological instinct to have a child is kicking in - and at that point everyone seems to have babies, but they can't." Ms Seenan suggests that for women in this position, it is easier to talk about mental health problems than infertility problems, which is the reason behind the forthcoming National Infertility Awareness Week. Neela Prabhu, 36, from London, knows how hard it is to spend years trying to become pregnant. She and her husband tried for over a year before seeking help, and that took its toll on them both. "My mental state at the time wasn't great and although some friends tried to be well-meaning, they kept saying unfunny things about our situation. They were trying to be helpful but sometimes it just hurt. All I could think about was having a baby." Neela's parents are from India and are very supportive, but she says her mother couldn't relate to her problems, partly because it is an issue rarely discussed in Asian communities. She says she wants this to change. "I want there to be more openness. I want women to talk about infertility even if they are dying inside, and I want to give women the confidence to talk about the journey of having a child. "But it just seems to be a taboo subject - why should this be?" Neela finally had a daughter four years ago after IVF and has recently discovered she is pregnant again with her second baby, following two failed cycles of IVF last year. She has never found out the cause of her fertility problems despite numerous investigations. Neela started trying for a baby at 27, but many women leave it much later and by doing so they decrease their chances of conceiving naturally and risk missing out on treatment under the NHS. Current guidelines recommend that women up to 39 should be offered three full cycles of IVF and women aged between 40 and 42 should have access to one cycle. But there are huge variations in criteria across the UK. In Oxford, for example, 35 is the limit for IVF treatment on the NHS. Tim Child, medical director at the Oxford Fertility Unit at the University of Oxford says people are leaving it too long before before going to see their GP about their fertility problems. "When couples start talking about their fertility, that's the point to speak to a healthcare professional. "Good advice can be given early on about weight, diet, alcohol intake etc which could help, but many couples try for years before seeking help and before they know it they are in their late 30s - and in some areas that's too old." He says that women wrongly assume that IVF is a good fallback solution when in fact the success rates are 40-50% for the under-35s, dropping to 20% for the under-40s and just 5% for women aged up to 43. Neela hopes that people can be more understanding and supportive towards women "who can't just fall off a log and get pregnant" so that people like her can feel more comfortable talking about it. Instead of asking personal, intrusive questions, she wants people to be aware that one in seven heterosexual couples in the UK is affected by infertility. Being judged has made Neela speak out. "People used to ask me, 'Don't you want another child?' It's really nobody's business but mine." National Infertility Awareness Week runs from 28 October. </body>

      <title>Metabolism 'obesity excuse' true</title>

      <body>The mocked "obesity excuse" of being born with a slow metabolism is actually true for some people, say researchers. A team at the University of Cambridge has found the first proof that mutated DNA does indeed slow metabolism. The researchers say fewer than one in 100 people are affected and are often severely obese by early childhood. The findings, published in the journal Cell, may lead to new obesity treatments even for people without the mutation. Scientists at the Institute of Metabolic Science, in Cambridge, knew that mice born without a section of DNA, a gene called KSR2, gained weight more easily. But they did not know what affect it may be having in people, so they analysed the DNA of 2,101 severely obese patients. Some had mutated versions of KSR2. It had a twin effect of increasing their appetite while their slowing metabolism. "You would be hungry and wanting to eat a lot, you would not want to move because of a slower metabolism and would probably also develop type 2 diabetes at a young age," lead researcher Prof Sadaf Farooqi told the BBC. She added: "It slows the ability to burn calories and that's important as it's a new explanation for obesity." KSR2 is mostly active in the brain and it affects the way individual cells interpret signals, such as the hormone insulin, from the blood. This in turn affects the body's ability to burn calories. Prof Farooqi said the metabolism argument had been derided by doctors, as well as wider society, due to a lack of evidence that metabolism was slowed in obese patients. In many cases obese patients have an elevated metabolism to cope with fuelling a much larger body. She said less than 1% of people had mutated versions of the gene and some would be a normal weight, but about 2% of children who were obese by the age of five would have the mutated gene. However, if drugs could be developed to target problems with KSR2, then it might be beneficial to anyone who is too fat. "Other genetic disorders, such as in blood pressure, have shown that even where there's a normal gene, targeting the pathway can still help," Prof Farooqi said. The amount and types of food eaten, as well as levels of exercise, directly affect weight, but some people at more risk of becoming obese that others. Obesity can run in families. The other obesity genes that have been discovered tend to affect appetite. People have two copies of the FTO gene - one from each parent - and each copy comes in a high- and a low-risk form. Those with two-high risk copies of the FTO gene are thought to be 70% more likely to become obese than those with low-risk genes. It makes fatty foods more tempting and alters levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin. Dr Katarina Kos, from the University of Exeter Medical School, said: "It is an exciting and interesting breakthrough, this is a new pathway predisposing people to obesity. "But it does exist in obese and lean people so you still need the obesogenic environment." </body>

      <title>Light shed on how genes shape face</title>
      <description>Scientists identify thousands of small regions of DNA that influence the way facial features develop.</description>

      <body>Scientists are starting to understand why one person's face can look so different from another's. Working on mice, researchers have identified thousands of small regions of DNA that influence the way facial features develop. The study also shows that tweaks to genetic material can subtly alter face shape. The findings, published in Science, could also help researchers to learn how facial birth defects arise. The researchers said that although the work was carried out on animals, the human face was likely to develop in the same way. Professor Axel Visel, from the Joint Genome Institute at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, told BBC News: "We're trying to find out how these instructions for building the human face are embedded in human DNA. "Somewhere in there there must be that blueprint that defines what our face looks like." The international team has found more than 4,000 "enhancers" in the mouse genome that appear to play a role in facial appearance. These short stretches of DNA act like switches, turning genes on and off. And for 200 of these, the researchers have identified how and where they work in developing mice. Prof Visel said: "In the mouse embryos we can see where exactly, as the face develops, this switch turns on the gene that it controls." The scientists also looked at what happened when three of these genetic switches were removed from mice. "These mice looked pretty normal, but it is really hard for humans to see differences in the face of mice," explained Prof Visel. "The way we can get around this is to use CT scans to study the shapes of the skulls of these mice. We take them and scan their heads. then we can measure the shape of the skull of these mice and we can do this in a very precise way." By comparing the transgenic mice with unmodified mice, the researchers found that the changes were very subtle. However some mice developed longer or shorter skulls, while others have wider or narrower faces. "What this really tells us is that this particular switch also plays a role in development of the skull and can affect what exactly the skull looks like," he explained. Understanding this could also help to reveal why and how things can go wrong as embryos develop in the womb, leading to facial birth defects. Prof Visel said: "There are many kinds of craniofacial birth defects; cleft of the lip and palate are the most common ones. "And they have severe implications for the kids that are affected. They affect feeding, speech, breathing, they can require extensive surgery and they have psychological implications." While some of these are caused by genetic mutations, the researchers want to understand how the genetic switches interact. Professor Visel added that scientists were just at the beginning of understanding the processes that shape the face, but their early results suggested it was an extremely complex process. He said it was unlikely in the near future that DNA could be used to predict someone's exact appearance, or that parents could alter genetic material to change the way a baby looks. </body>

      <body>A Derbyshire NHS trust must take urgent action to fix its finances and waiting lists, a health watchdog says. Derbyshire Hospitals Foundation NHS Trust has failed to balance its budget or meet emergency department targets, Monitor said. Its spokesman Adam Cayley said: "Derby must ensure immediate and effective action is now taken." The trust said it was "working with a number of key partners to develop a whole range of plans on performance". Monitor can appoint a new management team at the hospital if the trust fails to meet its targets. In April, Monitor asked the trust to meet a target of seeing 95% of patients within four hours of arriving at AandE but it only managed to see 93.4%. It also asked the trust to balance its books, but it had a deficit of £1.9m at the end of July. The watchdog, which regulates NHS foundation trusts, also had concerns about the number of superbug cases and the number of patients waiting more than 18 weeks between referral and treatment. A Monitor spokesman said: "These failures may be indicative of wider problems with how the trust is run. "Monitor will have to consider what changes will need to be made if the trust does not demonstrate rapid improvements." Sue James, trust chief executive, said she was "disappointed" in the report. A long winter and increased demand in services had affected targets. she added. She added: "We are delighted that more people want to come to Derbyshire but we hadn't expected that level of increased demand. "We need to make sure we can deal with it safely, which isn't always in the timescale that Monitor would like. "The quality and care we offer is excellent. We are very hopeful the improvements we are working to will be seen during the winter." The trust runs Royal Derby Hospital and London Road Community Hospital. </body>

      <title>Poor care risk 'at 1 in 4 hospitals'</title>
      <description>A quarter of hospital trusts in England are at raised risk of providing poor care, a review by the regulator shows.</description>

      <body>A quarter of hospital trusts in England are at raised risk of providing poor care, a review by the regulator shows. The findings are based on monitoring by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) of a host of data, including death rates, serious errors and patient surveys. It found 44 out of 161 trusts fell into the two highest risk categories. The exercise has been carried out as part of the regulator's new hospital inspection regime, which will see inspectors go into every trust by 2015. The first inspections got under way in September and by Christmas the first 18 will have been completed. It will result in every trust being given a rating of either 'outstanding', 'good', 'requires improvement' or 'inadequate' as part of a shake-up in the system ordered after the Stafford Hospital scandal. The CQC said the latest information was not a final judgement, but would be used to prioritise which trusts to inspect earlier in the process. Hospital chief inspector Prof Sir Mike Richards likened the risk review to a form of "screening". He added: "Our intelligent monitoring helps to give us a good picture of risk within trusts, showing us where we need to focus our inspections." The regulator has assessed each trust's performance against up to 150 different indicators. Those performing worse than would be expected on each indicator get marked down as being at risk or elevated risk for that topic. The number of risk scores they have determines which of the bands they are placed in. Bands one and two - those at highest risk - include 24 trusts and 20 trusts respectively. The trusts in band one include the 11 trusts already placed in special measures after a review of high mortality rates. They are joined by Croydon Health Services, which was rated high risk in 12 areas for issues such as patient survey results and whistle-blowing. Also in band one are Barking, Havering and Redbridge, which was rated high risk in 13 areas including AandE waits and patient surveys, and Aintree, rated high risk in 11 areas including an elevated risk for mortality rates. Health Foundation chief executive Dr Jennifer Dixon, who is also a CQC board member, said: "It makes sense to use the wealth of routinely available data in the NHS to try to spot patterns which might identify or predict poor quality care for patients. "The intelligent monitoring tool can never by itself be a crystal ball, but it is a great start and will surely develop over time." Dr Mark Porter, head of the British Medical Association, said publishing the data was an "important step" towards improving transparency across the NHS, informing and empowering patients and identifying under-performing hospitals. But he added: "Hospitals are large, complex organisations so we need to avoid oversimplifying or reducing vast amounts of data to a simple band or rating." Labour Shadow Health Minister Jamie Reed said: "David Cameron should be ashamed that he's put so many of England's hospitals in this position. "He siphoned £3bn out of the NHS front-line to blow on a back-office re-organisation nobody voted for. Hospitals were left on a financial knife-edge and they are clearly struggling to maintain standards of patient care after more than three years of chaos." But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "Sadly, under the last government, a lack of transparency about poor care meant problems went unchecked for too long, some times with tragic consequences for patients. "This government is being honest with the public about the quality of care at their local hospitals, and taking tough action where standards aren't up to scratch. Patients and staff deserve nothing less." </body>

      <title>NHS Direct to close down next year</title>
      <description>NHS Direct - one of the most recognisable names in the NHS - will be closed down in England next year.</description>

      <body>NHS Direct - one of the most recognisable names in the NHS - will be closed down in England next year. The organisation, which is an NHS trust, got into financial difficulty after winning a number of the contracts for the 111 phone line. It had already said it was pulling out of those - and this latest decision means its other services will be closed or transferred to other NHS bodies. The NHS Direct service began 15 years ago. It ran the national telephone advice line from the late 1990s until April this year, when the 111 service was launched. The 111 service was split into 46 different contracts and NHS Direct won 11 of them. But during the summer it announced it wanted to end these deals - nine of which had already started and two of which were yet to be launched - as they were "unsustainable". Replacement providers have already been found. NHS Direct also runs a number of other services, including an information website, GP appointments booking phone line and complaints service. Many of these are expected to be transferred to other parts of the health service or put out to tender. NHS Direct used to be paid more than £20 per call when it ran the old 0845 number. The payment was between £7 and £9 per call for the new 111 service - and call volumes were lower than expected. Projections reported earlier this year showed NHS Direct had lost £2.8m from April to June and was heading for a deficit of £26m if it continued until March. It will cease to exist at the end of the financial year. NHS Direct chair Joanne Shaw said the organisation should be proud of the innovation it had championed as it had helped pioneer "remote assessment, advice and information". The NHS Direct group in Wales is unaffected. </body>

      <body>MPs have rejected Jeremy Hunt's choice of candidate to lead England's health service regulator. Dominic Dodd was not "the right person" to take over from current Monitor chairman David Bennett, the health select committee said. The committee divided along party lines, with three Labour MPs out-voting two coalition ones. But the decision is not binding on the health secretary, who is said to be considering his next move. The committee released a brief statement on its decision, after it had grilled Mr Dodd at a pre-appointment hearing. It said: "Dr Bennett has both shaped and interpreted the role that Monitor now plays in the system, which makes the transition to another individual taking on the chair an especially difficult one. "We do not think Mr Dodd is the right person to undertake that difficult transition. On this basis we do not endorse Mr Dodd's appointment." The Conservative chairman of the committee, Stephen Dorrell, initially proposed that the committee should approve Mr Dodd's appointment but review his progress after six months, putting on record that it wanted to "hear further from him about how he plans to hold the chief executive to account and handle conflicts of interest". But a motion to withhold the committee's endorsement was put forward by Labour MP Barbara Keeley and backed by Labour colleagues Grahame Morris and Valerie Vaz. It was opposed by Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston and Liberal Democrat Andrew George. Mr Dorrell did not vote. The other Conservative members of the committee, Charlotte Leslie, Andrew Percy and David Tredinnick, did not attend the meeting on Wednesday. In a letter to the committee ahead of the meeting, Mr Hunt named Mr Dodd as "my preferred candidate for appointment". Currently the chairman of the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, Mr Dodd is also director of an academic health science system, UCL Partners, and non-executive director of Permanent TSB Group Holdings. He was previously a senior executive at management consultants Marakon Associates, whose clients include private healthcare firms. Under reforms of the NHS introduced by the coalition, Monitor is responsible for making sure public sector health providers are well led and overseeing choice and competition in the sector. A Department of Health spokesman said: "We have received the Health Select Committee report and will announce the next steps shortly." </body>

      <title>Boys catching up on life expectancy</title>
      <description>Baby girls born 30 years ago were expected to live six years longer than boys - and now it is less than four, statistics show.</description>

      <body>Boys are narrowing the gap on girls when it comes to life expectancy in England and Wales, statistics show. The Office for National Statistics says baby girls born 30 years ago were expected to live six years longer than boys - and now it is less than four. The latest figures show boys born between 2010 and 2012 can expect to live for 79 years and girls for 82.8 years. Life expectancy has continued to rise for men and women since the 1980s. In 1980-82, men's life expectancy was 71 and women's was 77 years old. Women continue to live longer than men, but the gap in life expectancy has been closing. Although both sexes have shown annual improvements in life expectancy at birth, over the past 30 years the gap has narrowed because larger numbers of people are surviving to an older age. This is contributing to the ageing population of England and Wales. The ONS also looked at how life expectancy has changed at the age of 65 in England and Wales. It found that men can expect to live for another 18.3 years, up from 13 years in 1980-82. Women aged 65 can expect to live for another 20.9 years, an increase of 3.9 years since 1980-82. The difference between male and female life expectancy at age 65 has decreased over the last 30 years from four to 2.6 years in 2010-12. The report said male life expectancy at age 65 was now the same as female life expectancy in 1994-96 at age 65. At 85 years old, a man in England and Wales had a life expectancy of 5.8 years in 2010-12, the stats showed. For women at 85 in 2010-12 life expectancy was slightly higher at 6.8 years. The ONS compared life expectancies in England to those in Wales and found that those in England were consistently, although marginally, higher than those in Wales at birth, age 65 and 85. </body>

      <body>Parents are being asked to urgently get their children vaccinated against measles to stop an outbreak of the disease spreading. Public Health Wales (PHW) said the number of cases linked to a Pontardawe school had risen to 13, while a case had been reported at a Swansea nursery. This outbreak comes less than four months after Wales' biggest measles outbreak ended - centred on the same area with 1,200 suspected cases. PHW said it was "very frustrated". "We now have cases not only in Cwmtawe school but also in two primary schools, a further education college and a nursery," said Dr Jorg Hoffmann, PHW's consultant in communicable disease control. "In all of these places there are unvaccinated children and young people who could easily catch and spread measles." Health officials have already written to all parents of unvaccinated children in Cwmtawe School to urge them to arrange for their children to be vaccinated. Pupils were offered the MMR vaccination with 55 children immunised during the school session but at least 46 did not take up the offer. Dr Hoffmann added: "We are very frustrated to see more cases of measles in the area so soon after the large outbreak earlier this year. "We are very keen for this to be stopped before it can get any bigger and we return to a position where children are admitted to hospital or die or are damaged by the disease. "The only way to achieve that is through vaccination and I urge parents whose children have not received two doses of MMR to ensure that they speak to their GP immediately to arrange this quick, safe and effective vaccine." The Swansea area epidemic lasted eight months with suspected cases first reported in November 12. By the time the outbreak was declared over in July, it had resulted in 1,219 notifications of measles cases in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas. Some 88 people visited a hospital due to measles during the outbreak and more than 75,000 were vaccinated throughout Wales. Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, from Swansea, died from pneumonia after contracting the virus at the height of the epidemic. The symptoms of measles include a fever, fatigue, runny nose, conjunctivitis and a distinctive red rash. </body>

      <title>Call for free vitamins for children</title>

      <body>England's chief medical officer has said all children should be offered vitamin supplements to safeguard their health. Currently the NHS offers free vitamins A, C and D to all children under five from low-income families. It has been claimed up to 25% of children are vitamin D deficient, leading to a rise in rickets cases. In her annual report, Prof Dame Sally Davies says extending the scheme would protect more children and save money. But she warned people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of what she says is a "very worrying picture" of children's health. And she said the UK lags behind many other European countries. Under the current scheme, children aged six months to four years are eligible for free vitamins if their parents are on benefits. But Dame Sally said more needed to be done to give children a good start with their health, and acting early would save taxpayers' money. She has asked the medicines watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), to examine the cost-effectiveness of offering vitamins A, C and D to all children under five. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 4's Today programme "Vitamin D deficiency is not just about poverty". She said children with developmental issues due to being born prematurely, those from ethnic minorities as well as children being "covered up" to protect them from the sun thereby missing out on the benefits too, She added: "Children get very locked on to screens and it can be difficult to turf them out into the sunlight. But the sun in the winter doesn't give you as much vitamin D so this is necessary." "This would cost pennies a day and would undoubtedly save money in the long run." She said the giving parents vitamins for their children would "empower" them, giving them an extra boost during the winter months when there is less sunlight. In her report, Dame Sally also called for more research into mental health problems in adolescents. She is calling for a survey of young people's mental health, amid concerns about funding and services. Only 25% of children with clinical mental health disorders receive specialist help within three years. Dame Sally said her annual report - which this year is on child health - questioned whether our society had got the balance right and should act as a wake-up call. She said obesity stood out as one of the big issues, but the report also demonstrated the interplay between health, social environment, emotional environment and education. Some of the statistics, such as five more children aged up to 14 years dying each day of avoidable causes than in Sweden, were "absolutely shocking", she said. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 5 live: "The majority of deaths are in the first year of life, and these relate to prematurity." She said premature births could be reduced by stopping smoking during pregnancy and by improving the health and diet of pregnant women. The chief medical officer's annual report also calls for: National Children's Bureau chief executive Dr Hilary Emery said: "The UK must have greater expectations for children's health if we are to be the best place in the world for children to grow up. "As a nation we must be much more ambitious about giving every child the best start in life, and this should be a priority for all decision makers in central and local government." The report is entitled - Our Children Deserve Better, Prevention Pays. </body>

      <body>Healthy people should not take aspirin to ward off heart attacks and cancer, according to the most comprehensive review of the risks and benefits. There has been growing debate about whether all people over 50 should take a daily, low dose aspirin. But the review, conducted by the research arm of the NHS, said it was a "fine balance" due to the dangers of bleeding in the brain and stomach. Overall it warned against taking the drug, until there was more evidence. Aspirin makes the blood less sticky so it reduces the odds of a blood clot forming inside the body, which could cause a heart attack or stroke. There are even studies suggesting it can cut the risk of some cancers. However, as the drug makes it harder for the blood to clot it can cause problems inside the body. The drug is given to people at high risk of a heart attack or stroke as the medical benefit is clear. However, there have been calls to give aspirin to otherwise healthy people as well. A team at Warwick Medical School was asked to assess the evidence by the NHS National Institute for Health Research. For heart attacks and strokes, they concluded giving everyone aspirin would cause "net harm due to increased potential for bleeding". This was in part due to better management of at-risk patients including prescribing drugs to lower blood pressure. On cancer, they concluded the evidence was not strong enough to base a decision on, but trials taking place would give clearer proof in the next five years. Prof Aileen Clarke, who led the review, told the BBC: "The risks are finely balanced and for now there is not the evidence to advise people to take it. "It would be lovely to say over-50s should take an aspirin a day and have much less cancer, but the research hasn't yet been done and we should be cautious. "We need to be extremely careful about over-promoting aspirin." Amy Thompson, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: "Aspirin is extremely important for many heart patients, but for people free of heart disease the jury is still out as the risks are likely to outweigh the benefits. "Further research is underway which will shed light on who else is likely to benefit the most from taking aspirin." </body>

      <body>It is not a myth - women really are better than men at multitasking, at least in certain cases, a study says. Men were slower and less organised than women when switching rapidly between tasks in tests by UK psychologists. Both sexes struggled to cope with juggling priorities, but men suffered more on average, according to the paper in the journal BMC Psychology. It says: "The question now is why? And is it all types of multitasking or only certain situations?" The researchers hope to encourage more research on a topic which they say has attracted "astonishingly few" studies - considering how often the "women vs men" debate crops up in conversation. If men really are slower than women, it could have serious implications for how workplaces are organised, says co-author Dr Gijsbert Stoet, of the University of Glasgow. "Multitasking is getting more and more important in the office - but it's very distracting, all these gadgets interrupting our workflow. "It could be that men suffer more from this constant switching," he told BBC News. Previous studies on gender and multitasking have drawn widely different conclusions. One experiment in China found that women outperformed their male counterparts, while another in Sweden found that men may actually be better than women at multitasking when spatial tasks are involved. To settle the argument, Dr Stoet and a colleague set out to compare women and men in a certain type of multitasking; the kind we use when faced with juggling many tasks in rapid succession - but not quite simultaneously. These might include office workers who jump between incoming emails, phone calls and assignments, while running in and out of meetings. Another example might be parents in the household - cooking a meal while looking after young children and suddenly having to answer the phone. First, they compared 120 women and 120 men in a computer test which involves switching between tasks involving counting and shape-recognition. Men and women were equal when tasks were tackled one at a time. But when the tasks were mixed up there was a clear difference. Both women and men slowed down, and made more mistakes, as the switching became more rapid. But the men were significantly slower - taking 77% longer to respond, whereas women took 69% longer. "This difference may seem small, but it adds up" over a working day or week, said Dr Stoet. To make the experiment more relevant to everyday life, the researchers tried a second test. A group of women and men were given eight minutes to complete a series of tasks - locating restaurants on a map, doing simple maths problems, answering a phone call, and deciding how they would search for a lost key in a field. Completing all these assignments in eight minutes was impossible - so it forced men and women to prioritise, organise their time, and keep calm under pressure. In the key search task in particular, women displayed a clear performance advantage over men, says co-author Prof Keith Laws, of the University of Hertfordshire. "You can see from the drawings - women used methodical search patterns, like going round the field in concentric circles. That's a highly productive strategy for finding a lost object. "Whereas some men didn't even search the whole field in any particular manner, which is just bizarre." The reason, he observed, was that women were more organised under pressure. "They spent more time thinking at the beginning, whereas men had a slight impulsiveness, they jumped in too quickly," said Prof Laws. "It suggests that - in a stressed and complex situation - women are more able to stop and think about what's going on in front of them." Altogether, they conclude that women "have an advantage over men" in multitasking, at least in certain situations. "This suggestion does rankle a bit with men," Prof Laws explained. "Men tell me this just doesn't ring true with their experience. They regale me with stories about how the greatest pilots in the RAF are men and they have to deal with lots of different incoming information all the time. "And of course there are men who are experts. We'd never claim that all men can't multitask, or that only women can. "But we'd argue the average woman is better able to organise her time and switch between tasks than the average man. "There's no point denying these differences exist." Psychologist Dr Dongning Ren of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said the study was a useful addition to the scientific debate. "In my own research, I found similar results, so this adds support for this conclusion," she told the BBC. "Still, it is possible that for certain tasks, men might be better at multitasking. It may depend on the nature of the tasks - sequential or simultaneous." In a world where people increasingly have to multitask, we need to help individuals adapt their roles to their abilities, said Prof Laws. "Of course I don't think we should just assign women to roles where rapid switching is demanded," he explained. Instead, employers should consider assessing individuals' ability in multitasking, as some firms already do. "Because the truth is - people don't seem to be very good at assessing themselves," Prof Laws told BBC News. "Studies show that men tend to think they're better at multitasking than they are in reality, and women tend to think they're worse than they really are. "I think I am great at it, but my wife thinks I'm not." If women really are better than men, the obvious question is why? It could be that what Dr Stoet and Prof Laws observed is a learning effect - where people become expert multitaskers by practice. But there are plenty of evolutionary theories too - such as the hunter-gatherer hypothesis. This invokes a rather traditional image of women at home, cooking and tending to the infants, with men out doing so-called "linear" tasks such as chasing and killing prey. "Put simply - if women couldn't multitask, we wouldn't be here," said Dr Stoet. And interestingly - compared to our closest relatives, the apes, we are all terrible at multitasking - men and women alike. If humans have "lost" this ability during evolution, it suggests that our simple, one-track minds could actually give us an advantage, Dr Stoet explained. "Filtering out distractions helps us to achieve things we couldn't otherwise do. Like making fire," he said, offering a grain of comfort to those who find themselves on the wrong side of the divide. </body>

      <title>Theme park defends asylum attraction</title>
      <description>Calls are made to shut down a Halloween attraction at a theme park which features actors dressed as mental health patients.</description>

      <body>Calls to shut down a theme park Halloween attraction have been made in a petition whose organisers say it stigmatises mental illness. The Asylum maze has been part of Thorpe Park's annual Fright Nights for more than eight years. Campaigners claim having actors chasing people around an asylum stigmatises mental illness. Thorpe Park said the attraction was not offensive or a realistic portrayal of a mental health institution. A petition organised by Katie Sutton, a mental health nursing student at the University of Salford, has attracted more than 900 signatures. Miss Sutton said she first became aware of the maze through Twitter. "Thorpe Park kept repeating to people that there weren't sufficient complaints. I thought if we can get actual forms of people bothered about it, then it might help." She said the matter had been discussed in one of her university classes and "everyone in the room was absolutely horrified". The charity Rethink Mental Illness has carried out a poll on Twitter to gauge people's views. Paul Jenkins, its chief executive officer, said: "While some people clearly feel very strongly about this, opinion has been mixed. "While of course there's nothing wrong with a bit of Halloween fun, explicit references to 'patients' crosses a line and reinforces damaging stereotypes about mental illness." In September, supermarket chains Tesco and Asda withdrew two Halloween outfits after they were criticised for stigmatising people with mental health issues. Asda dropped its "mental patient fancy dress costume", and Tesco later withdrew its "psycho ward" outfit. In a statement, a Thorpe Park spokeswoman said the negative comments were not "universally representative". "This is primarily a matter of context. The maze is not something you happen upon when out shopping," she said. "This maze is also in its eighth year of operation and is an obviously extreme and simulated experience which draws on classic horror film content. "It is not intended, nor is it deemed to be by those who have actually experienced it, to be in any way offensive or to be a realistic portrayal of a mental health or indeed any other institution." </body>

      <title>Is 'addiction' an excuse to overeat?</title>
      <description>Expert argues "food addiction" may just be an excuse to overeat</description>

      <body>"Food addiction" is becoming a popular term to explain overeating. But in this Scrubbing Up, Professor John Blundell from the Institute of Psychological Sciences at the University of Leeds warns the term is being used far too freely. Some have likened food addiction to drug addiction, and then used this term to associate it with overeating, and as a clinical explanation for the obesity epidemic, implicating millions of people. The use of the term food addiction is a step towards medicalisation and implies that normal human social behaviour is pathological. Forms of eating therefore become an illness. This attitude is not helpful and has huge implications for the way in which people view their own behaviour and their lives. The concept of food addiction comes from a combination of experimental data, anecdotal observations, scientific claims, personal opinions, deductions and beliefs. It is an over-simplification of a very complex set of behaviours. The existing evidence fails to define the precise characteristics of the actual foods concerned or the eating environment that underlies the assumed addiction risk. This is in contrast to drug addiction, where the molecule is identified and its pharmacological effect on the brain is characterised. Animal studies have shown changes to specific brain regions in those given a sugary diet - and human brain scans show activation of reward systems in the same part of the brain when sweet tastes are consumed. Therefore, it is not surprising that reward centres are activated when sweet foods are consumed, as we know that the reward circuits in the brain have been established through evolution as signalling systems that control our appetite. Many stimuli influence these areas of the brain and, in addition, there is an intrinsic drive to consume carbohydrate-rich foods to satisfy a basic metabolic need of the brain. Sweetness is a major signal for such foods but the science has not yet assessed this fully and much more work is needed before we could say that food is addictive. Attributing food addiction as the single cause underlying the development of obesity, despite the existence of numerous other very plausible explanations, is unhelpful, particularly for those trying to live more healthy lives. I am concerned that many people may potentially latch on to the concept of food addiction as an excuse to explain their overeating - the premise that it's "not my fault" and therefore, "I can't help it". This removes the personal responsibility they should feel and could act on - and they infer that their eating is a form of disease. Food addiction may offer an appealing explanation for some people but the concept could seriously hinder an individual's capacity for personal control. Binge eating disorder does exist - but it is a rare clinical condition affecting fewer than 3% of obese people. Sufferers have a strong compulsion to eat, which persists alongside the sense of a loss of control. Addiction-like food behaviour may be a component of the severe and compulsive form of binge eating disorder. But this condition does not explain the huge rise in obesity we have seen across the population. Binge eating is not a key cause of obesity and, therefore, in the context of mass public health, is not a major concern. What we need is a calm and composed analysis of what the words food addiction really mean so that people can make informed deductions about the causes of their own behaviour. If you are concerned that you may have an eating disorder and would like to speak with someone about it, you could contact the charity beat on 08456341414. </body>

      <description>Two doctors attack conventional medical equipment with power tools</description>

      <body>Archimedes did it in the bath, Tesla with a walking stick and the father of the sticky note had his flash of inspiration while singing in church - or so legend has it. Yet today we expect new inventions to be born in anonymous laboratories after the submission of several grant proposals. But the age of the home-grown inventor may not be over. David Williams and John Dingley are consultant anaesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Their moment of genius came in their garages while tinkering with glue-guns and car-body filler. Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they wondered "almost jokingly" whether it might be possible to make something similarly economical and easy-to-use in the medical world. And having worked in remote settings, Dr Williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be. In Zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable mains power supply. So the doctors set themselves the challenge of inventing essential kit for the doctor's bag on a budget. And after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools, they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives. The ShakerScope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people's eyes, ears and throats. But unlike regular devices it does not need batteries. Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said: "According to the World Health Organisation, 95% of medical devices fail to work in developing countries. Often designers in the West don't understand the conditions elsewhere. "This type of invention is very important. With these scopes you would normally need three different instruments for each examination, each one requiring batteries. For low income countries this is a joke. " At the core of the ShakerScope is a powerful moveable magnet, surrounded by a coil of wire. As noted by Michael Faraday in 1831, as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induces an electric current in the coil. And shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes. "That might not sound like long but it is more than enough time for most ear or eye examinations or to insert tracheal tubes," Dr Williams said. Once the scope is shaken the charge can be stored for many weeks. And instead of using a conventional light bulb, it uses a light emitting diode which can last up to 10,000 hours. The team has designed changeable heads allowing it be converted into a number of devices. One of its most promising uses so far has been as a laryngoscope - an instrument which lights-up the back of the mouth allowing anaesthetists to insert breathing tubes when people are unable to breathe for themselves. It has already been tested in military hospitals in Afghanistan, in Uganda and after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. "In Haiti we saw a lady with a neck injury who urgently needed a tracheal tube to help stabilise her. There were no other functioning laryngoscopes close by and the ShakerScope worked well despite the difficult case," said Dr Williams. According to Dr Williams the project has been a series of steep learning curves. "Having the good idea is the easy part. Making it into a reality required an almost obsessive degree of dedication," he said. In the early days the doctors tried to do as much as possible from home - from teaching themselves microelectronics to perfecting their computer-aided design skills. Luckily for Dr Williams, his wife is a sculptor who works on large pieces of metal. He has been known to borrow her workshop, saws and glue-gun on many occasions. But he says he learned very early on that the kitchen may not be the best place to melt plastics. Dr Jerry Nolan, a consultant anaesthetist at Bath Royal United NHS Trust, who was not involved in the research said: "The ShakerScope has the potential to be invaluable in remote locations. "That they have taught themselves the skills to get a final version near to market is even more remarkable and surely disproves the adage doctors make poor businessmen." The device is one of many frugal, home-grown devices recently showcased at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in the UK. Having made several fully-functioning versions tested across the world, the doctors say they recently reached the limit of their technical abilities, and passed on further manufacturing and design to a larger company. But these anaesthetists have returned to their sheds and have many other possible irons in the fire. </body>

      <body>Colin Hambrook is a poet and visual artist with mental health difficulties and ME. He runs Disability Arts Online (DAO) a web portal for disabled artists which reviews and showcases their work. In Hambrook's latest autobiographical project, Knitting Time, he recalls being brought up by a Jehovah's Witness mother who was mentally ill. She, Hambrook and the other Jehovah's Witnesses they knew, believed that the world was due to end in 1975. This collection of illustrated poetry, and the accompanying art exhibition, explore the psychosis and grief he experienced as a result. Why did you call it Knitting Time? Knitting time is an allegory for psychosis. What that does to you is bring you to a place where time is distended. Brain functions, like memory and cognition, can get distorted and it becomes very difficult to believe what's going on in your head. The idea of Knitting Time was to try and encapsulate that sense of bringing yourself back into reality. What's it about? The story that unfolds through the poetry and artwork is that of my mother. She was sectioned in the late 60s, early 70s and knitting was one of the key activities that "mental patients" were given to keep their hands busy. Once they had finished, the knitting was ripped apart and the wool re-used. My mother's psychosis got worse as time went on and knitting became a key part of her world. She was knitting new universes, places of safety we could go to when the world ended. What was it like to believe that the world would end before you'd reached adulthood? I was a very serious little boy and took the Jehovah's Witnesses seriously. It was frightening to be brought up in this belief and to realise I had to do my best to be perfect, so that I'd be among the chosen ones when the end came. Everything went wrong quite a few years before 1975 though. When my mother was sectioned, we were thrown out of the faith. We were led to believe that only families who had a strong patriarch at their helm were eligible to be chosen but dad refused to have anything to do with the Jehovah's Witnesses, So we felt we were damned anyway. You were 16 in 1975. Did you still believe the end was imminent? By 1975, I had largely come to realise that it was all rubbish. All about money, power and religious oppression. But there was still a part of me that was keyed in to those beliefs. How did you feel when the end never came? My feelings were mixed. What had happened to my mother in the mental health system left me very depressed, so a big part of me was looking forward to it all ending. I didn't move forward easily. I became very lost and pretty mentally ill and stayed in that state for most of my twenties. There's part of me that's never quite come to terms with the fact that the world didn't end in 1975. Knitting Time's main theme is psychosis. What's your personal experience of this? I don't think psychosis is necessarily a bad thing. It's common for toddlers to have imaginary friends and night visions, to see things that aren't there. I had that facility to a greater degree than most. I remember vividly seeing things at night time like a lion treading up the stairs or a man dressed in an archetypal burglar outfit, swag-bag on back. Did your psychotic episodes change when you became an adult? This capacity for hallucination has come and gone throughout my life. A large part of me realised early on that it was my mind playing tricks. If I haven't slept and my nervous system is distended, it is likely that the psychotic episode will be unpleasant. But if I can relax into it and find space to let it be, then it can be interesting. When I was nine or 10, an angel exuding white light stayed with me all night. That was very beautiful. What was your motivation for producing work about psychosis? People's prejudice around psychosis is down to a fear of those kinds of experiences, because people don't understand it and people don't talk about it. One of my main motivations for doing this project was to try and have a conversation about something people see as very dark and very difficult. The other big theme of Knitting Time is grief. Why? After my mum had electric shock therapy, she temporarily lost all memory of her children. It was like she'd died, the person we knew before never came back. During my pre-teen and teenage years, I went through a process of mourning. A lot of my psychosis was in response to the grief I felt. I read a book by Joan Didion about the years following her husband's death, when she went through a psychosis related to her grief. It brought home to me my own experiences as a child. The poetry I wrote for Knitting Time is a reflection on that part of my life and how, like Joan, I came through it with the help of family and friends. Knitting time is published by Waterloo Press.

      <body>One is made of fruit. The other is caffeinated. So a smoothie is a healthier option than a coffee, right? Don't be so sure, says Michael Mosley, as he weighs the evidence. Which is healthier - coffee or smoothies? It seems obvious that the answer must be a smoothie. After all, drinking coffee is a necessary evil while having a smoothie, made from fruit, is part of your five-a-day. But when you look into the scientific studies they reveal something much more surprising. Let's start with coffee. There have been numerous claims down the years that drinking coffee will increase your risk of a whole range of terrible things from heart disease to cancer. These claims have been largely based on case control studies, where you take a group of people who drink coffee and compare them with another matched group who don't. The problem with this approach is that coffee drinkers are more likely than non-coffee drinkers to have other "bad" habits, like drinking alcohol or smoking, so it is hard to tease apart what is really doing the harm. A more reliable way to get at the truth is to do what is called a prospective cohort study. You take a group of disease-free individuals, collect data about them, then follow them for a large number of years to see what happens. When scientists collected data on the coffee drinking habits of 130,000 men and women and then followed them for over 20 years they found that coffee is rather a good thing (The Relationship of Coffee Consumption with Mortality, Annals of Internal Medicine, June 2008). They crunched the numbers and concluded that "regular coffee consumption was not associated with an increased mortality rate in either men or women". In fact, data from this study suggests that moderate coffee consumption is mildly protective, leading to slightly lower all-cause mortality in coffee drinkers than non-coffee drinkers. Based on this and other studies the most effective "dose" is two to five cups a day. More than that and any benefits drop off. There are hundreds of different substances in coffee, including many different flavonoids (compounds widely found in plants that have antioxidant effects). Which of these ingredients is beneficial, we simply don't know. When it comes to the brain, however, the answer seems to be "caffeine". In research recently published in the World Journal of Biological Psychiatry (July 2013) they found that people who drank two to four cups of caffeinated coffee a day were half as likely to commit suicide as those who either drank decaff or fewer than two cups a day. This research pulled together data from three studies that had followed more than 200,000 people for more than 14 years, so it's pretty reliable. It is also supported by a number of other studies, which makes this claim even more plausible. One reason why caffeine may be a mild anti-depressant is that as well as making you more alert, it increases levels of neurotransmitters in the brain, like dopamine and serotonin, that are known to improve mood. The researchers don't recommend going overboard, noting that "there is little further benefit for consumption above two to three cups". One note of caution is that these trials began many years ago so the sort of coffee consumption being tested is almost certainly good, old-fashioned coffee. A simple mug of coffee delivers somewhere between zero and 60 calories, depending on whether it is black, white or white with one sugar. Cappuccinos, lattes and mochas contain coffee but they also contain a lot of calories - anything between 100 and 600 - so when it comes to fancy coffees I limit myself to the occasional tall, skinny cappuccino (70 calories). But what about fruit smoothies? They may consist of pure fruit but by the time you've got rid of the peel and mashed the fibre then you have already lost many of the potential health benefits. What you are mainly left with is a sugary drink. In a survey published in early 2013, researchers found that out of 52 commercial smoothies, 41 had more sugar than Coca-Cola (a 12oz can contains the equivalent of about nine teaspoons), and all had more calories. Fruit smoothies are acidic and the bits cling to your teeth, so dentists are not enthusiastic. An apple a day may keep the doctor away, but not when it's been peeled, blended, mashed and packaged. In a study published in August 2013 in the British Medical Journal (Fruit Consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes) they found that while eating fruit cuts your risk of developing diabetes, drinking it appears to increase the risk. This was another big study involving lots of people followed for many years. An interesting finding was that different fruits gave different levels of benefit. Three servings of blueberries, for example, cut the risk of diabetes by 26%, while eating apples, pears, bananas and grapefruits also had a positive, albeit much smaller, effect. Overall those who ate fruit cut their risk of developing diabetes by 2%, while those who drank it (more than three glasses of fruit juice a week) increased their risk by 8%. More bad news for fruit juice drinkers comes from a case-controlled study done in Western Australia that examined the daily diets of more than 2,000 people. They found that eating some types of fruit and vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower and apples) cuts your risk of colorectal cancer, while drinking fruit juice was associated with an increased risk of rectal cancer. Sugary drinks lead to raised levels of the hormone insulin and persistently high levels of insulin are associated with increased risk of some cancers. The researchers point out that many things that protect against bowel cancer, such as antioxidants and fibre, are lost or diminished during the juicing process. None of these studies specifically looked at the health benefits or otherwise of fruit smoothies, which are a relatively recent phenomenon, nor did they look at the impact of different types of juice - for instance, whether it was freshly squeezed or from concentrate, home-made or shop-bought. I would assume, for example, that drinking a home-made vegetable smoothie is going to be a lot better for you than a commercial fruit smoothie. And I very much doubt that the occasional fruit juice or fruit smoothie is going to do any harm. Nonetheless, I've personally given up buying them and we rarely have them in the house. I eat whole fruit and when it comes to soft drinks I'm sticking to water, tea and, of course, coffee. Trust Me I'm A Doctor is broadcast on BBC Two at 20:00 BST on Thursday 24 October, or catch up with iPlayer Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook Michael Mosley answered readers' questions on Twitter using #AskMichael. Q: The article seems to conflate smoothies and juices re lack of fibre. Does fibre in a handmade smoothie blunt insulin? A: Commercial juices and smoothies are lower in fibre than eating fruit and veg. Handmade ones may be better but will still be lower than fruit and veg. Eating apples will keep you feeling full for longer than drinking same amount as apple juice. I met someone who takes it to the extreme. He peels the apple, eats the peel, throw rest away. Q: Why do you persist in offering fad diets when we have the examples of sportsmen who just eat right and exercise? A: The simple message, "eat less, do more exercise" simply doesn't work with most people. It's time to acknowledge that. Q: Is it ok to eat 4 fruits each day, eg: banana, grapes, apple, orange? Is this too much sugar? A: Banana and grapes have lots sugar. Apples, pears and berries have less sugar. Vegetables generally have lower GI and calories. Commercial smoothies are often banana based, so they have lots of sugar and calories. Q: What is worse? High fat, low carbohydrate or high carbohydrate low fat diets? A: I think the important thing is the type of carbohydrates and type of fat. Highly processed food is bad. Q: It seems what we are told is either good or bad for us changes like the wind. How do we know what to believe? A: The problem is that many health beliefs are based on poor studies. The best option is a prospective cohort study. In a prospective cohort study you follow people over time, not at a moment in time. When this was done for coffee drinking it was shown to be mildly beneficial. Q: I only ever have proper butter, never spreads or margarine. Do I need to only have tiny amounts though? A: I eat butter rather than margarine, as do many cardiologists I know. But it's rich in calories, so I am restrained. Q: Any good news on the horizon for chronic migraine? A: On Trust Me I'm a Doctor we looked at Botox which seems to work quite well for chronic migraine. Q: Drinking enough water is important, but how important is the pH value in tap water? A: The idea we should drink 2 litres a day is a myth. Drink when you're thirsty. I don't know about the effect of pH in water. Q: Is one banana a day too many? A: No. Eating fruit is generally good. Q: Yes or no, should we drink pure fruit smoothies? A: I don't. If it tastes sweet it has lots of sugar. Some have more than 10 teaspoons of sugar. </body>

      <title>Peek-a-boo: A window on baby's brain</title>
      <description>What a baby's sense of humour can tell us about their brains</description>

      <body>A baby's first smile is an exciting moment. But what can it tell us about their understanding of the world? Boasting about the speed of childhood development is the sport of choice for many a doting parent. From the 12-week scan right through the early years, monitoring the physical and mental progress of their pride and joy is a source of both excitement and concern. Especially rewarding is the onset of smiles, squeals and laughter - the kind of milestones that make all the disturbed nights worth it. But is it all just wind? Apparently not, as researchers now think that laughter and games like peek-a-boo could be telling us something more, and giving us a way to peer inside the workings of their minds. "Laughter and smiles start incredibly early, just like tears," says Dr Caspar Addyman, a baby laughter researcher at Birkbeck College in London. "So this leads us to think that it's a form of communication," he told the BBC. Dr Addyman has collected nearly 700 questionnaires about baby smiles and laughter from around the world. He found that babies are smiling in response to pleasant feelings much earlier than expected, which can be as young as one month old. Soon after that, at between two to four months, social smiles develop that are used specifically to engage the parents. He now hopes to take the research further and use laughter as a new way of tracking what it is that babies understand about the world around them. The person who most greatly influenced our current view of childhood development was Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Careful observations of children at different ages led him to identify four stages that everyone must go through to reach the cognitive abilities of an adult (see box). In the earliest months of life, Piaget said that babies are only able to learn about the world by directly interacting with it through grasping, shaking and sucking. With each experience, he concluded, children gradually build up a picture of how the world works - a kind of naïve physics. But Dr Addyman thinks that studying babies' laughter can be just as effective at helping us pinpoint developments in the way their minds are expanding. "You can't laugh at something until you get the joke, so what they laugh at really tells us about their understanding of the world," says Addyman. As a result of having experienced so little, small children are for the most part quite content to accept the absurd as completely plausible. Dr Addyman, who sports a crop of bright blue hair, sees this regularly with his young volunteers. "Young babies would never laugh at my hair. But older children realise there's something wrong and that makes it funny." The ability of children to suddenly see the funny side, Dr Addyman believes, acts to highlight much more profound developments going on deep inside their brains. The Baby Laughter Project, which has surveyed parents from more than 20 countries, has shown that games like peek-a-boo are perfect for showing one such fundamental development - object permanence. The term describes the understanding that an object still exists, even if you can't see it. Very young children don't know this, which is why babies under around six months can look shocked and startled at peek-a-boo. They think that not being able to see mum or dad's face means that they've actually disappeared, making their sudden reappearance come as quite a surprise. However once a child understands (at around six- to eight-months old) that their parent is just hiding, then peek-a-boo becomes all about the anticipation of when they're going to come back. "Peek a boo is all the best things. It's mummy reappearing, but it's also about shared communication," says Dr Addyman. "You can't help but smile and laugh when a baby starts laughing with you, which is really valuable for them developing their ability to interact with other people." A potential link between laughter and language development suggests we've thus far underestimated babies' sense of humour. Joking requires an element of taking turns as well as other skills needed for advanced interaction, like imitation and eye-contact. "Children can pick up the rhythms of conversation through joking and playing games," says Dr Addyman. In fact, smiles and laughter could be important communication tools for infants before they develop language. Even primates seem to use laughter as a way of regulating social interaction. "Laughter in chimps is predominantly used in play and it tends to be the youngest members of the group who have time for playing," says Dr Katie Slocombe, a primate cognition specialist at the University of York. "It's been shown in chimps that laughter facilitates extended play, and we can't rule out that it has some sort of role in social bonding. When a chimp laughs, it seems to encourage their play partner to continue tickling or chasing them - just like a baby keeping an adult's attention for longer," she told the BBC. So should we try harder to interpret the deeper meaning in those burbles and titters? Dr Addyman suggests a certain level of caution. "Historically, we've certainly been guilty of projecting adult interpretations about what babies are laughing at, and it's a constant danger when doing this kind of research," he says. "You really have to look at this scientifically and at a range of ages to really start to understand what's going on in their heads." </body>

      <title>When an operating theatre becomes a lab</title>
      <description>Why research is key to better surgery</description>

      <body>Scientific research takes place in a lab, doesn't it? Well, not when the developments are in surgery. Then it takes place in the clinics, wards and even the operating theatre. In this week's Scrubbing Up, Prof Dion Morton, director of research at the Royal College of Surgeons, says it is crucial that patients understand how important the work is - and that they take part. When people think about clinical trials their first thought might be of laboratories where pharmaceutical companies test the safety and effectiveness of drugs and vaccines. But in surgery too, clinical trials are a vitally important way of assessing the benefits new treatments bring to patients. Research and clinical trials are a daily part of the NHS, with many studies carried out by doctors and healthcare professionals who treat patients on a daily basis. Although 98% of people in the UK will need surgery at some point in their lives, less than 5% of government funding for medical research goes on improving surgery and developing new techniques. Surgery has been referred to as the 'Cinderella' of medical research, although funding has been slowly improving in recent years. From treating acute trauma to replacing joints after chronic disease, surgery has a broad impact and still cures more cancers than any other form of treatment. It is a vital part of the health service and investment in research is crucial if we are to be at the forefront of improving patient care. This is why new surgical clinical trial centres have been set up across the country. Surgeons are currently recruiting patients to assess new surgical techniques and determine which procedures give patients the best chance of making a full recovery. Each centre will focus on many different types of surgery including transplantation, heart and orthopaedic. Trials are challenging to design and it can be difficult to recruit patients, but with careful planning and good communication they are made possible. I am working on an international study which aims to find out at what point patients with late stage bowel cancer should be given chemotherapy. Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK and patients currently have to have surgery first to remove the cancer and then have chemotherapy. However, when the disease is advanced, all too often the cancer returns in the months or years that follow. This trial will look at whether patients who are given some chemotherapy prior to surgery are less likely to see their cancer return in the two years after treatment. In Bristol, colleagues are running a trial to compare the effectiveness of two common operations to treat severe obesity - gastric band and gastric bypass. During the course of the trial doctors will study over 700 patients, of which half will have been fitted with a gastric band and half will have had a bypass. Over three years they will compare how much weight patients' lose, whether they experience any complications following surgery and to what extent their quality of life improves following the operation. Obesity is a rapidly increasing global health problem which costs the NHS billions of pounds. Surgery is both a clinically-effective and cost-effective way of treating this disease and so the results of this trial will help the NHS decide which of these two treatments they should offer to patients. Surgical research has the potential to make real improvements in the way we care and treat patients. Patient safety and innovation go hand in hand as it is the evidence gained from these trials that will ultimately lead to reduced patient mortality and sickness. Despite limited investment, surgeons are striving to develop the evidence for new techniques and procedures that can change the face of hospital care. Raising standards, delivering new surgical treatments to patients and delivering them safely nationwide is central to a high quality health service. </body>

      <title>The drugs derived from deadly poisons</title>
      <description>The drugs derived from deadly poisons</description>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <title>Where the penalty for miscarriage is jail</title>
      <description>A country where a woman may be jailed for losing a child</description>

      <body>El Salvador has one of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the world. A side-effect is that women who suffer miscarriages or stillbirths are sometimes suspected of inducing an abortion - and can even be jailed for murder. Glenda Xiomara Cruz was crippled by abdominal pain and heavy bleeding in the early hours of 30 October 2012. The 19-year-old from Puerto El Triunfo, eastern El Salvador, went to the nearest public hospital where doctors said she had lost her baby. It was the first she knew about the pregnancy as her menstrual cycle was unbroken, her weight practically unchanged, and a pregnancy test in May 2012 had been negative. Four days later she was charged with aggravated murder - intentionally murdering the 38-to-42 week foetus - at a court hearing she was too sick to attend. The hospital had reported her to the police for a suspected abortion. After two emergency operations and three weeks in hospital she was moved to Ilopango women's prison on the outskirts of the capital San Salvador. Then last month she was sentenced to 10 years in jail, the judge ruling that she should have saved the baby's life. Her lawyer, Dennis Munoz Estanley, says the legal system has an inbuilt "presumption of guilt" making it hard for women to prove their innocence. "She is yet another innocent victim of our unjust and discriminatory legal system which jails poor, young women who suffer obstetric complications for murder on the most flimsy evidence," he says. Xiomara's father describes the conviction as a "terrible injustice". He testified in court that his daughter had endured years of domestic violence at the hands of her partner. And yet the prosecution - which sought a 50-year jail term - relied heavily on this man's allegation that she had intentionally killed the foetus. Xiomara has not seen her four-year-old daughter since the miscarriage. El Salvador is one of five countries with a total ban on abortion, along with Nicaragua, Chile, Honduras and Dominican Republic. Since 1998, the law has allowed no exceptions - even if a woman is raped, her life is at risk or the foetus is severely deformed. More than 200 women were reported to the police between 2000 and 2011, of whom 129 were prosecuted and 49 convicted - 26 for murder (with sentences of 12 to 35 years) and 23 for abortion, according to research by Citizens' Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion. Seven more have been convicted since 2012. The study underlines that these women are overwhelmingly poor, unmarried and poorly educated - and they are usually denounced by public hospital staff. Not a single criminal case originated from the private health sector where thousands of abortions are believed to take place annually. Munoz has worked with 29 of the incarcerated women, helping secure the early release of eight. "Only one intentionally induced an abortion, the other 28 suffered natural obstetric complications but were jailed for murder without any direct evidence," he says. Last year when Maria Teresa Rivera suffered a miscarriage, she was sentenced to 40 years in jail for aggravated murder. Like Xiomara, Teresa, 28, had no pregnancy symptoms before sudden severe pain and bleeding, and was reported to police by the public hospital where she had sought emergency help. The scientific evidence was flimsy, according to Munoz who will soon lodge an appeal, and the prosecution relied heavily on a colleague of hers, who testified that Rivera had said she "might be" pregnant a full 11 months before the miscarriage. A textile factory worker, she was the family's only breadwinner and her eight-year-old son is now living in dire poverty with his grandmother. Cristina Quintanilla's story is different. On 24 October 2004, the 18-year-old from rural San Miguel was seven months pregnant with her second child, living with her mother in the capital to be near a hospital for the birth. Her boyfriend was working in the US, but the couple were excited, buying baby clothes and saving food tokens. "Around midnight I felt an immense pain, I thought I was dying," Quintanilla says. "I was banging on the bathroom door to get my mum's attention when I felt the baby drop out. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital." Her mother called the police - a typical step for Salvadorans in an emergency, who took them to hospital. Quintanilla was given an anaesthetic, and interrogated when she came round. Then she was handcuffed to the hospital bed, charged with manslaughter and transferred to a police cell. The first judge dismissed the case, but the prosecution appealed, upgrading the charge to aggravated murder. Quintanilla was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in jail, where she was vilified as a child killer. Her son Daniel, then only four, spent four years living with his great-grandmother until Munoz succeeded in having the sentence reduced to three years. "The medical reports couldn't explain why the baby died, but the prosecutor made me out to be a criminal who could have saved my baby even though I had passed out in pain," she says. "I will never understand why they did this to me, I lost four years of my life and still don't know why I lost my baby." Morena Herrera from Citizens' Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion says these cases have had a chilling effect, with many pregnant poor women who suffer miscarriages or complications during pregnancy "too afraid to seek medical help". "I would be terrified to go a public hospital as there is no benefit of doubt given to young women, we are presumed guilty and jailed," says Bessy Ramirez, 27, from San Salvador. "We cannot even rely on health staff to put their prejudices aside and treat us confidentially." The strict abortion law has other serious human rights implications. Suicide was the most common cause of death in 2011 among 10-to-19-year-old girls, half of whom were pregnant, according to Health Ministry figures. It was also the third most common cause of maternal mortality. Earlier this year, the plight of lupus sufferer Beatriz, 22, attracted international condemnation after the Supreme Court refused to authorise an abortion, even though her life was at risk and the foetus too deformed to be viable. Beatriz's health deteriorated while the court deliberated for several months. She gave birth at 27 weeks. The baby died within hours. Individual members of the current FMLN government, particularly Health Minister Maria Isabel Rodriguez, criticised the abortion law during the controversy over Beatriz's case. But the government has made no attempt to repeal or relax the law since coming to power in 2009, as it remains popular with large parts of the conservative population, who revere the Church and pro-life religious groups such as Si a la Vida (Yes to Life). The Arena Party, which is strongly allied with the Church, is favourite to win next year's General Election. But Esther Major, Amnesty International's El Salvador expert, describes the country's abortion law as "cruel and discriminatory". "Women and girls end up in prison for being unwilling, or simply tragically unable, to carry the pregnancy to term," she says. "It makes seeking hospital treatment for complications during pregnancy, including a miscarriage, a dangerous lottery. "It cannot be in the interests of society to criminalise women and girls in this way." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>Millions of people swear by vitamin supplements. But many are wasting their time and some could even be harming themselves, argues Dr Chris van Tulleken. In November 1912 a party of three men and 16 dogs set out from a remote base in eastern Antarctica to explore a series of crevasses many hundreds of miles away. Three months later just one of the men returned. His name was Douglas Mawson. His skin was peeling off and his hair was falling out. He had lost almost half his body weight. He recounted what Sir Edmund Hillary described as "the greatest story of lone survival in the history of polar exploration". A month into their journey, one of the team, along with the tent, most of the provisions and six dogs plunged into a crevasse, never to be seen again. Mawson and the other surviving member, Xavier Mertz, started to return to base, surviving in part by eating the remaining dogs. After a few weeks Mertz developed stomach pains and diarrhoea. Then his skin started to peel off and his hair fell out. He died incontinent and delirious a few days later. Mawson suffered similar symptoms. With the kind of understatement typical of his generation of polar explorers he described the skin of the soles of his feet peeling off: "The sight of my feet gave me quite a shock, for the thickened skin of the soles had separated in each case as a complete layer... The new skin underneath was very much abraded and raw." It was the suffering of early explorers and sailors that motivated the first studies of vitamins and their deficiency diseases. At first sight Mawson's story seems to be another such tale - starvation combined with a lack of some vital nutrient. In fact, Mawson's description of his symptoms is an almost textbook description of vitamin A overdose - probably from eating dog liver. As little as 100g of husky liver could give a hungry explorer a fatal dose. Mawson lived to the decent age of 76 but in his story we find the cautionary tale for our times - vitamins can be very bad for you. This piece is about what we have learned about vitamin supplements in the last few years - if you are healthy, and you live in a country like the UK, taking multi-vitamins and high-dose antioxidants may shorten your life. For most of us, for most of the time, they're unhealthy. "Argh!" I hear you say, "I spend loads of money on them and the claims on the packet are really persuasive. Everything, from my full head of hair to my sex life, depends on them!" I want to get into this in a bit more detail because the vitamin companies certainly don't agree with me. So why do we believe they're useful and why do we take them? Vitamins are essential for life, and there are groups of people even in the UK who benefit from specific supplementation, but general unsupervised vitamin pill-popping is more than just a waste of money. The problem is that we all feel very warm and fuzzy about vitamins because, firstly, the tales of deficiency are so horrific, secondly, we read breakfast cereal packs and thirdly, a double-Nobel laureate called Linus Pauling liked vitamin C in vast, vast doses. All this is packaged by the people now selling us vitamins over the counter into that most beguiling of all logical falsehoods - if a little is good, then more must be better. Now I knew the names of the most obscure vitamins long before medical school because I have always had a fondness for the kind of multicoloured, artificially flavoured breakfast cereals that are marketed using a combination of unlikely cartoon animals and claims of being "vitamin and mineral-enriched". And it has to be said that this vitamin and mineral enrichment of staple food has been one of the most effective public health interventions in history. It continues to save countless lives per year even in Europe. So, while you shouldn't eat dog liver in Antarctica, vitamin A deficiency hugely increases the risk of blindness and death in children with measles and diarrhoea in developing countries. So the World Health Organization recommends a very strict amount and cautions that higher doses can cause birth defects in early pregnancy among other problems. So vitamins do make a huge difference to life expectancy in some circumstances, which is persuasive, and the breakfast propaganda catches us in our most vulnerable, bleary-eyed, early morning state, hinting to us that these vitamins have some sort of catch-all, beneficial effect on our lives, that will transform us into the healthy, energetic beautiful people/cartoon creatures portrayed on the cereal box. These things contribute to a general ideal of healthfulness of vitamins. And then there's Linus Pauling. Whether or not you've heard of him, Linus Pauling is a major influence on vitamin and nutrient culture. It's almost impossible to imagine someone with more authority and credibility. He won two Nobel prizes and was, by all accounts, a genuinely good bloke. He wrote a book in 1970 saying that high doses of vitamin C could be effective in combating flu, cancer, cardiovascular disease, infections and degenerative problems. He took immense quantities himself, hundreds of times the required amount, and lived to a ripe old age surrounded by many great grandchildren. He was the poster boy for mega-dosing of vitamins and this contributed to the growth of an industry supported by the belief that supplementation of these molecules in our diet is beneficial in almost every way imaginable. But rather than taking one man's word for it, however credible, it's worth looking at the results of studies that look at what happens to people who take these supplements for long periods of time. Looking at any one individual study won't be very revealing to answer the question of whether vitamin supplementation is good for you. They're densely scientific and the conflicts of interest can be very hard to spot. For the answer you have to turn to what are called "systematic review papers". This is where independent scientists gather up all the available data and re-analyse it to answer big questions. Here's what a couple of them say: "We found no evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention [of diseases of any kind]. Beta-carotene and vitamin E seem to increase mortality, and so may higher doses of vitamin A. Antioxidant supplements need to be considered as medicinal products and should undergo sufficient evaluation before marketing". (See references below). Just to be clear - "increase mortality" - that means they're killing you. These are powerfully bioactive compounds but they're not regulated in the same way as drugs. Whatever you think about the regulation there should surely be a warning on the pack if there's data saying they're bad for us. The next question is - why are they bad for us? It's very hard to pick apart the data, partly because vitamins are a fabulously diverse group of chemicals. I'm going to include what people normally refer to as minerals under the heading of vitamins. They're required in the diet not for energy, but as chemical partners for the enzymes involved in the body's metabolism - cell production, tissue repair, and other vital processes. Their functions are understood largely by their deficiency diseases so we're not exactly sure of precisely what they all do or how they interact. Antioxidants provide a nice example. They soak up the very toxic, chemically-reactive by-products of metabolism called free radicals. These free radicals, left unchecked, can cause damage to DNA and may be linked to cancer. Your cells are full of antioxidants but surely taking more would be better? Right? Keep those cancer causing radicals under control? Well, unfortunately, your body's immune system fights infections by using free radicals to kill bugs. Exactly what effect huge quantities of extra antioxidants could have on this is not clear but it's easy to imagine that it might not be good and you could get more infections. Vitamin A is linked to increasing lung cancer in smokers. Excess zinc is linked to reduced immune function. Long-term excessive intake of manganese is linked to muscle and nerve disorders in older people. Niacin in excess has been linked to cell damage. And so on. And it gets more complicated still when you start mixing everything up in one tablet. For example, different minerals compete for absorption. If you take large quantities of calcium you won't be able to absorb your iron. If you take large quantities of iron you won't be able to absorb zinc. If you take vitamin C you'll reduce your copper level. So it's not just that taking lots of one thing is not good for you, it's that it may cause a dangerous reduction in something else even if you are also supplementing that. To work out the optimal ratios is all but impossible although some manufactures claim to have worked it out. So when are supplements recommended? The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends certain supplements for some groups of people who are at risk of deficiency, including: Your GP may also recommend supplements if you need them for a medical condition. If you decide to take supplements, stick to within the RDA, unless you've had guidance from a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist to exceed the dose. If you've got questions about dosage levels, consult a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist. The tales of deficiency combined with the success of enrichment programmes mean that it's easy to make that leap of logic that if a little is good then more must be better. And if you read my article last week on water you'll see where this is going. I could do this every week. The same article. Substitute water for vitamins/probiotics/antibiotics. Don't trust the science done by the people who are trying to sell them to you and don't assume that if some is good more must be better. It's like beer. Or coffee. Or computer games. Goldilocks was right about things needing to be just right. References: Bjelakovic G, Nikolova D, Simonetti RG, Gluud C.

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>Can too much rumination be dangerous?</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <title>Why I write my Down's dad blog</title>

      <body>The Future's Rosie recently won "best new blog" at the MAD (Mum and Dad) Blog awards. In it, Thomas Bachofner documents the progress of his two-year-old daughter, Rosie, who has Down's Syndrome. But why does he blog about it? I'm a graphic designer from Cheshire, not known for writing or reading any books. So it came as a surprise to me that I could even string a sentence together, let alone write a blog that is well received - I'm guessing it's because it comes from the heart. My site is about Rosie's achievements, such as last week when she stood up for the first time, but it also gives me an opportunity to do my little bit towards raising positive awareness of Down's. The first post was published on 14 February 2012 but the idea to share our story with the world came much earlier. When my wife Karen and I learnt that our unborn daughter had Down's syndrome, it was a shock, and it didn't feel like anybody understood our predicament. As a parent, you assume that everything will be fine. Our two boys, Harry and Joe, were born without complications. But we were told about Rosie's condition in such a negative way that we thought it would change our lives drastically for the worse. I found that all I wanted to do was read real-life parent stories from people in our situation, not the science and figures you become bombarded with when searching online. But there weren't many Down's syndrome parenting blogs around at the time and even fewer were written from a dad's perspective. I started to jot things down and was surprised to find that it helped get my emotions out. My scribbles eventually turned into The Future's Rosie which is having more of an impact on me and others than I could ever have predicted. Initially it was a handy way of telling my friends and family how I was feeling and it meant I didn't have to repeat myself over and over at what was a delicate time for me. But many of them began to share it with their friends and, before I knew it, my blog was being read by hundreds of people. I've shared lots of private thoughts about her development and how we as a family are all pitching in to help her. Last year I wrote about what I called "a barbaric-looking developmental aid" given to Rosie by her physio. It's a standing brace and we couldn't get her to use it. She hadn't wanted to walk or crawl, so we got Rosie's brothers to stand on the sofa and blow bubbles which made her reach up and support her body with her legs in order to strengthen them. I've covered learning the Makaton sign language, feeling full of pride when my young sons Harry and Joe stood on stage at school to give a talk about Down's to 250 kids, and I wrote about the weekend we all survived without Mummy being there. One of the hardest things I have done is write about Rosie's surgery. Children with Down's syndrome often have related heart difficulties and Rosie was born with a hole in the heart which needed fixing. My blog entry on that day included post-op pictures of my daughter - it felt like these might be useful for parents to see, if they too have to face the same operation with their Down's syndrome child. As Rosie got older, I quickly learned that my own pre-conceived ideas of Down's were both ignorant and outdated. I wanted to teach others about the reality in a non-patronising manner, so decided to use myself as an example in my own social media campaign. I did it from Rosie's perspective and called it Things I've Taught My Daddy. As with the blog, before I knew it the captioned images I shared on Facebook and Twitter had been seen by thousands worldwide. One of the messages I tried to communicate was that people with Down's are people first and foremost. They are more like their families than they are each other, though many people still find it difficult to see past the physical characteristics associated with the syndrome. Life with Rosie really is very normal, in fact she has been a far easier baby than both her older brothers were. The whole family love her to pieces and I genuinely wouldn't change a single thing about her - well, maybe the volume of her cries when she is hungry. After all "Down's syndrome" isn't who she is, it is just a part of her. Thomas Bachofner blogs at The Future's Rosie You can follow Ouch on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Light shed on how genes shape face</title>
      <description>Scientists identify thousands of small regions of DNA that influence the way facial features develop.</description>

      <body>Scientists are starting to understand why one person's face can look so different from another's. Working on mice, researchers have identified thousands of small regions of DNA that influence the way facial features develop. The study also shows that tweaks to genetic material can subtly alter face shape. The findings, published in Science, could also help researchers to learn how facial birth defects arise. The researchers said that although the work was carried out on animals, the human face was likely to develop in the same way. Professor Axel Visel, from the Joint Genome Institute at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, told BBC News: "We're trying to find out how these instructions for building the human face are embedded in human DNA. "Somewhere in there there must be that blueprint that defines what our face looks like." The international team has found more than 4,000 "enhancers" in the mouse genome that appear to play a role in facial appearance. These short stretches of DNA act like switches, turning genes on and off. And for 200 of these, the researchers have identified how and where they work in developing mice. Prof Visel said: "In the mouse embryos we can see where exactly, as the face develops, this switch turns on the gene that it controls." The scientists also looked at what happened when three of these genetic switches were removed from mice. "These mice looked pretty normal, but it is really hard for humans to see differences in the face of mice," explained Prof Visel. "The way we can get around this is to use CT scans to study the shapes of the skulls of these mice. We take them and scan their heads. then we can measure the shape of the skull of these mice and we can do this in a very precise way." By comparing the transgenic mice with unmodified mice, the researchers found that the changes were very subtle. However some mice developed longer or shorter skulls, while others have wider or narrower faces. "What this really tells us is that this particular switch also plays a role in development of the skull and can affect what exactly the skull looks like," he explained. Understanding this could also help to reveal why and how things can go wrong as embryos develop in the womb, leading to facial birth defects. Prof Visel said: "There are many kinds of craniofacial birth defects; cleft of the lip and palate are the most common ones. "And they have severe implications for the kids that are affected. They affect feeding, speech, breathing, they can require extensive surgery and they have psychological implications." While some of these are caused by genetic mutations, the researchers want to understand how the genetic switches interact. Professor Visel added that scientists were just at the beginning of understanding the processes that shape the face, but their early results suggested it was an extremely complex process. He said it was unlikely in the near future that DNA could be used to predict someone's exact appearance, or that parents could alter genetic material to change the way a baby looks. </body>

      <title>Get outside and go wild, kids urged</title>
      <description>Children are being urged to take back their "wild time" by playing outside more to regain a connection with the natural world.</description>

      <body>Children are being urged to take back their "wild time", swapping 30 minutes of screen use for outdoor activities. The call to renew a connection with nature comes from a collaboration of almost 400 organisations, from playgroups to the NHS. The Wild Network wants children to take up activities like conkers and camping. "The tragic truth is that kids have lost touch with nature and the outdoors in just one generation," said chairman Andy Simpson. The organisers argue that swapping 30 minutes of television and computer games each day for outdoor play would increase the levels of fitness and alertness and improve children's well-being "Time spent outdoors is down, roaming ranges have fallen drastically, activity levels are declining and the ability to identify common species has been lost," said Mr Simpson. He referred to recent research by the RSPB which suggested only one in five children aged eight to 12 had a connection with nature. "With many more parents becoming concerned about the dominance of screen time in their children's lives, and growing scientific evidence that a decline in active time is bad news for the health and happiness of our children, we all need to become marketing directors for nature," said Mr Simpson. "An extra 30 minutes of wild time every day for all under 12-year-olds in the UK would be the equivalent of just three months of their childhood spent outdoors. "We want parents to see what this magical wonder product does for their kids' development, independence and creativity, by giving wild time a go." The campaign launches on Friday with the release of a documentary film, Project Wild Thing. It tells the story of how, in a bid to get his daughter and son outside, film-maker David Bond appoints himself marketing director for nature, working with branding and outdoor experts to develop a campaign. "I wanted to understand why my children's childhood is so different from mine, whether this matters and, if it does, what I can do about it," said Mr Bond. "The reasons why kids, whether they live in cities or the countryside, have become disconnected from nature and the outdoors are complex. "Project Wild Thing isn't some misty-eyed nostalgia for the past. We need to make more space for wild time in children's daily routine, freeing this generation of kids to have the sort of experiences that many of us took for granted. "It's all about finding wildness on your doorstep and discovering the sights, sounds and smells of nature, whether in a back garden, local park or green space at the end of the road." The campaign, said to be the biggest ever aiming to reconnect children with the outdoors, includes the National Trust, the RSPB, Play England and the NHS, as well as playgroups, businesses and schools. </body>

      <title>Seven-planet solar system found</title>
      <description>Astronomers have discovered the seventh planet orbiting a distant star, which they describe as one of the richest planetary systems known to science.</description>

      <body>Astronomers may have identified one of the richest planetary systems yet. The discovery of a seventh planet around the dwarf star KIC 11442793 could be a record, according to two separate teams of researchers. The system bears some similarities to our own, but all seven planets orbit much closer to their host star, which lies some 2,500 light-years from Earth. The crowded solar system is described in two papers published on the pre-print server Arxiv.org. One of the identifications was made by volunteers using the Planet Hunters website. The site was set up to allow volunteers to sift through the public data from Nasa's Kepler space telescope - which was launched to search for so-called exoplanets - worlds orbiting distant stars. Kepler uses the transit method to discover new planets, which entails looking for the dip in light as an alien world passes in front of its host star. But there is simply too much data for mission scientists to examine every light curve, so they developed computer programmes to search for the signature of a planetary transit. "This is the first seven-planet system from Kepler, using a transiting search. We think [the identification] is very secure," said Chris Lintott, from the University of Oxford, co-author on the Planet Hunters paper. "With a transiting system, once you get multiple planets, the odds of them being false positives are very small." Dr Lintott's team has submitted their research to the Astronomical Journal for peer review. Another team of astronomers from several European countries has submitted a separate paper outlining their independent discovery of the seventh planet to the Astrophysical Journal. The new planet is the fifth furthest from its parent star, orbiting with a period of nearly 125 days. With a radius of 2.8 times that of the Earth, it fits into a family that now includes two roughly Earth sized worlds, three "super-Earths" and two larger bodies. "It actually looks like our Solar System in one sense, with all the small planets on the inside and the big planets on the outside. And that's not necessarily what we always see," said co-author Robert Simpson, also from Oxford University. While there might be resemblances to our Solar System, all seven planets are closer to their host star. In fact they would all fit within the Earth's distance from the Sun, making this a very crowded neighbourhood. "This is one of the reasons they are easy to see, because the closer they are to their sun, the more frequently they go around it," said Dr Simpson. However, the Planet Hunters team carried out simulations showing that the planetary system should be a stable one. Dr Lintott, who co-presents the BBC's Sky at Night programme and helped found Planet Hunters, added: "Everything we know about this system tells us [the seventh planet] should have been found using the automatic detection routines. But it wasn't." "A seven-planet system is very complicated so you get a sense of why the automatic routine might have missed out - it gets confused by the presence of the other transits. "Looking for these transits seems like a task that's perfectly designed for computers. But we keep finding, in these niche cases, in these odd cases, in these complicated cases that humans can beat the computers." Another star, HD 10180, has been claimed to have either seven, or nine planetary signals. A distant sun called GJ 887C may also have a family of seven planets. Commenting on the paper by the Planet Hunters team, Andrew Collier Cameron, professor of astronomy at the University of St Andrews, said: "It's intriguing that a system as well-studied as KOI-351 can still harbour hidden surprises that can only be winkled out by human eyes." He added: "This is a perennial problem in transit hunting, of which we are only too acutely aware in our own ground-based searches. "The best transit signal-detection algorithms developed to date still come a very poor second to the human visual system when it comes to pattern recognition. Still, we have to rely on machines, because of the sheer volume of data produced by enterprises like transit searches." Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter </body>

      <body>It is not a myth - women really are better than men at multitasking, at least in certain cases, a study says. Men were slower and less organised than women when switching rapidly between tasks in tests by UK psychologists. Both sexes struggled to cope with juggling priorities, but men suffered more on average, according to the paper in the journal BMC Psychology. It says: "The question now is why? And is it all types of multitasking or only certain situations?" The researchers hope to encourage more research on a topic which they say has attracted "astonishingly few" studies - considering how often the "women vs men" debate crops up in conversation. If men really are slower than women, it could have serious implications for how workplaces are organised, says co-author Dr Gijsbert Stoet, of the University of Glasgow. "Multitasking is getting more and more important in the office - but it's very distracting, all these gadgets interrupting our workflow. "It could be that men suffer more from this constant switching," he told BBC News. Previous studies on gender and multitasking have drawn widely different conclusions. One experiment in China found that women outperformed their male counterparts, while another in Sweden found that men may actually be better than women at multitasking when spatial tasks are involved. To settle the argument, Dr Stoet and a colleague set out to compare women and men in a certain type of multitasking; the kind we use when faced with juggling many tasks in rapid succession - but not quite simultaneously. These might include office workers who jump between incoming emails, phone calls and assignments, while running in and out of meetings. Another example might be parents in the household - cooking a meal while looking after young children and suddenly having to answer the phone. First, they compared 120 women and 120 men in a computer test which involves switching between tasks involving counting and shape-recognition. Men and women were equal when tasks were tackled one at a time. But when the tasks were mixed up there was a clear difference. Both women and men slowed down, and made more mistakes, as the switching became more rapid. But the men were significantly slower - taking 77% longer to respond, whereas women took 69% longer. "This difference may seem small, but it adds up" over a working day or week, said Dr Stoet. To make the experiment more relevant to everyday life, the researchers tried a second test. A group of women and men were given eight minutes to complete a series of tasks - locating restaurants on a map, doing simple maths problems, answering a phone call, and deciding how they would search for a lost key in a field. Completing all these assignments in eight minutes was impossible - so it forced men and women to prioritise, organise their time, and keep calm under pressure. In the key search task in particular, women displayed a clear performance advantage over men, says co-author Prof Keith Laws, of the University of Hertfordshire. "You can see from the drawings - women used methodical search patterns, like going round the field in concentric circles. That's a highly productive strategy for finding a lost object. "Whereas some men didn't even search the whole field in any particular manner, which is just bizarre." The reason, he observed, was that women were more organised under pressure. "They spent more time thinking at the beginning, whereas men had a slight impulsiveness, they jumped in too quickly," said Prof Laws. "It suggests that - in a stressed and complex situation - women are more able to stop and think about what's going on in front of them." Altogether, they conclude that women "have an advantage over men" in multitasking, at least in certain situations. "This suggestion does rankle a bit with men," Prof Laws explained. "Men tell me this just doesn't ring true with their experience. They regale me with stories about how the greatest pilots in the RAF are men and they have to deal with lots of different incoming information all the time. "And of course there are men who are experts. We'd never claim that all men can't multitask, or that only women can. "But we'd argue the average woman is better able to organise her time and switch between tasks than the average man. "There's no point denying these differences exist." Psychologist Dr Dongning Ren of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said the study was a useful addition to the scientific debate. "In my own research, I found similar results, so this adds support for this conclusion," she told the BBC. "Still, it is possible that for certain tasks, men might be better at multitasking. It may depend on the nature of the tasks - sequential or simultaneous." In a world where people increasingly have to multitask, we need to help individuals adapt their roles to their abilities, said Prof Laws. "Of course I don't think we should just assign women to roles where rapid switching is demanded," he explained. Instead, employers should consider assessing individuals' ability in multitasking, as some firms already do. "Because the truth is - people don't seem to be very good at assessing themselves," Prof Laws told BBC News. "Studies show that men tend to think they're better at multitasking than they are in reality, and women tend to think they're worse than they really are. "I think I am great at it, but my wife thinks I'm not." If women really are better than men, the obvious question is why? It could be that what Dr Stoet and Prof Laws observed is a learning effect - where people become expert multitaskers by practice. But there are plenty of evolutionary theories too - such as the hunter-gatherer hypothesis. This invokes a rather traditional image of women at home, cooking and tending to the infants, with men out doing so-called "linear" tasks such as chasing and killing prey. "Put simply - if women couldn't multitask, we wouldn't be here," said Dr Stoet. And interestingly - compared to our closest relatives, the apes, we are all terrible at multitasking - men and women alike. If humans have "lost" this ability during evolution, it suggests that our simple, one-track minds could actually give us an advantage, Dr Stoet explained. "Filtering out distractions helps us to achieve things we couldn't otherwise do. Like making fire," he said, offering a grain of comfort to those who find themselves on the wrong side of the divide. </body>

      <body>Archaeologists in Peru have found two mummies more than 1,000 years old in a suburb of the capital, Lima. The mummies - of an adult and a child - were found at an ancient religious complex which has been under excavation since 1981. The child is believed to have been an offering to the gods and may have been buried alive after the adult's death. Researchers also found other offerings including the remains of guinea pigs and jars with feline designs. "This is one of the most important finds in more than three decades of excavation, because the mummies are intact," researcher Gladys Paz told the AFP news agency. The mummies are squatting and are fully dressed wrapped in rope. It is the third intact find among more than 70 tombs uncovered in the Huaca Pucllana tomb, a pyramid-like temple built by the pre-Columbian Wari culture between 100 and 600 AD in what is now the Miraflores neighbourhood. In 2010, archaeologists found the remains of a woman with four children, and in 2008, the remains of a teenage girl. The site was built on 2.5 hectares of land and towers over 20m (66ft) high. So far, only about 40% has been excavated. The Wari culture flourished between AD 500 to 1,000 on the coastal area of northern Peru. Little is known about them, as they did not appear to leave a written record. </body>

      <title>National Trust 'open' to fracking</title>

      <body>National Trust director-general Dame Helen Ghosh says the conservation charity has an "open mind" about allowing fracking on its land. Her comments appear to contradict the Trust's position of a "presumption against" the controversial technology. Campaigners say the environmental risks of fracturing rock to release gas are too great. A spokesman says the Trust has not changed its position but will review any new evidence in the future. Fracking is the process of drilling down into shale rock before a high-pressure water mixture is directed at the rock to release the gas inside. Water, sand and chemicals are injected into the rock at high pressure which allows the gas to flow out to the head of the well. In an interview with The Times Newspaper, Dame Helen said: "We all have yet to see what the surface environmental impact of fracking is and when we have seen it we would reach a view." She added: "We are waiting for the evidence. We have an open mind." However, the Trust's position on fracking says: "We have a presumption against fracking on our land because natural gas is a fossil gas. "The mining process also gives rise to potential environmental and landscape impacts." It goes on to say: "Whilst the use of natural gas might buy time to develop secure, renewable alternative energy sources, it also risks distracting us from focusing on the development of these and on the need for us all to concentrate on using less energy in the first place. 'Fool's gold' A Trust spokesman said: "Our position is a presumption against fracking on our land. "It doesn't mean that in time that won't change - if the environmental and visual impacts are negligible and it is part of a strategy to move to a low carbon economy." The Trust adopted its position of a presumption against the gas/oil extraction technique during the summer's anti-fracking protests at Balcombe, West Sussex, where energy company Caudrilla planned to carry out test drilling. Earlier this year, the charity's director of conservation, Peter Nixon, described fracking as "fool's gold". He said: "If it takes our eyes off the ball from the need for energy efficiency and a long-term sustainable source of renewable energy, it will be fool's gold." The spokesman told BBC News: "Shale gas is a fossil fuel [that] may prove a fool's gold and distract attention from a shift to renewables. "The environmental and visual impacts are also unproven, and this is what concerns many people. We want to see more evidence on what this impact will be." </body>

      <title>Badger cull extension confirmed</title>
      <description>The pilot badger cull in west Gloucestershire is to be extended for a further eight weeks, Natural England confirms.</description>

      <body>The pilot badger cull in west Gloucestershire will continue for another eight weeks after a licence was granted, Natural England has confirmed. During the six-week period of the original licence, 708 badgers were killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Ministers and the NFU say culling badgers will curb TB in cattle, but protesters say it has little effect. A licence has already been granted to extend the Somerset cull to 1 November. Natural England said it had granted the extension after taking advice from Defra's chief veterinary officer and chief scientific adviser who said failure to extend would raise the risk of increasing the spread of TB by dispersing badgers. The new licence, which runs until 18 December, specifies that a minimum of 540 and a maximum of 940 badgers can be culled in order to control the disease. 'Badger cull madness' As the close season for cage trapping and shooting begins on 1 December, only controlled shooting will be permitted from 1-18 December. Animal welfare charity, Humane Society International (HSI) UK, said it was "appalled" to hear the extension had been granted. The charity said prolonging the shooting "is the very worst thing the government can do because it increases the risk of spreading bovine TB as badgers flee the area". Gloucestershire resident Mark Jones, who is executive director of HSI UK, said: "I am flabbergasted that an eight-week extension has been granted to Defra's badger killing fiasco in Gloucestershire. "By extending culls here as well as in Somerset, the pilots are moving even more dangerously away from the recommendations of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial which were very clear - the longer you subject badgers to this sort of disruption, the greater the risk of worsening the spread of bovine TB among both badgers and cattle. "Surely somebody in government can put a stop to Owen Paterson's badger cull madness before it's too late?" Badger Trust spokesman Jack Reedy said: "It goes against the advice that Defra gave to itself, that it should be a maximum of six weeks. "If they're not following their own terms of reference then that's something that is very actionable so we shall be going either for a judicial review or for an injunction." </body>

      <title>Tree pest begins march from Moscow</title>
      <description>The emerald ash borer, a tree-killing beetle that has cost the US economy billions of dollars, could "spread unhindered" across Europe, a study warns.</description>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70645000/jpg/_70645809_c0109978-emerald_ash_borer_on_a_leaf-spl.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>An invasive species of beetle that has killed tens of millions of ash trees in North America could "spread unhindered" across Europe, researchers have warned. The emerald ash borer, first recorded in the Moscow area in 2007, has become established in surrounding broadleaved woodlands, they observed. The pest, which is expected to cost the US economy $10bn, has spread up to 25 miles each year, the team estimated. The findings of the survey have been published in the journal Forestry. The team of two UK and two Russian scientists found that the emerald ash borer (EAB) population had spread 146 miles (235km) west of Moscow and 137 miles (220 km) south of the Russian capital city. In their paper, the team described EAB (Agrilus planipennis) as a "major threat to Fraxinus excelsior (European ash), and south of Moscow, where the beetle has become established in natural broadleaved woodlands in which F. excelsior is a major component, many of the ash trees are suffering severe dieback and mortality". They added: "The abundance and almost continuous distribution of F. excelsior in these woodlands means that A. planipennis now has the opportunity to spread unhindered on a broad front to other countries in Europe." Enemy within The beetle is native to north-east China, the Korean peninsula, Japan, Taiwan, Mongolia and the Russian Far East. The beetles' larvae feed on the surface layers of the wood of a tree, cutting off vital supplies of nutrients and water, causing branches and eventually the whole tree to die. Although the adult beetles only live for a matter of weeks, an individual female can lay in excess of 200 eggs during their short lives but the average is estimated to be in the region of 30-60 eggs. While native Asian ash trees appear to have co-evolved resistance to the EAB, US native ash species, such as the green ash (F. pennsylvanica) and white ash (F. americana) have no such resilience, resulting in devastating consequences. Since the first recorded case of an EAB infestation in Michigan back in 2002, the invasive alien species has spread rapidly through 19 US states and two Canadian provinces, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake. The researchers wrote: "The beetle has killed tens of millions of trees over the past 10 years and has raised concerns over the future of ash in North America. "The cost to the US economy over the 10-year period from 2009 to 2019 - in terms of tree removal and replacement alone - is expected to exceed $10bn." Whether a similar fate awaits European ash trees remained uncertain at this stage, explained co-author David Williams, an entomologist from Forest Research, the scientific arm of the UK Forestry Commission. During the summer, Dr Williams and colleague Dr Nigel Straw spent two weeks in and around Moscow to assess the impact and spread of EAB in the area. Dr Williams told BBC News that previous research suggested that an individual beetle would not fly more than six miles (10km) during its lifetime. Yet the team, in their assessment, found evidence that EAB was spreading by up to four times that distance. "There is evidence that the species is riding on vehicles, which is why it is moving long distances," Dr Williams observed. "If it is travelling long distances, it is dependent on a host tree being available for it to jump on to." "To the south of the city, European ash is a component of the natural woodlands. Now that it is established in these woodlands, it is difficult to judge how quickly it is likely to move." He added that it was difficult to quantify the size of the emerald ash borer population that had become established in the woodlands south of Moscow. "Trying to find signs and symptoms of EAB damage is unbelievably difficult in the early stages," Dr Williams explained. "It does seem to be from our observations that it [is] much harder to spot signs and symptoms of EAB damage in European ash than in North American species of ash. "So the fact that it has reached this almost continuous forest of ash into Europe through Belarus and Ukraine is going to [make it] difficult to track its movement." Touch wood The UK is more than 1,500 miles from Moscow, and the Forestry Commission predicts that it is likely to be "many years" before the pest reaches these shores under its own steam. However, a spokesman added: "Regulations are in place to minimise the risk of its accidental introduction in trade and transport, and we are assessing whether more needs to be done to further reduce these risks." He added that the UK and the EU were currently drafting Pest Risk Analyses on EAB. In addition, tree health experts were developing a contingency plan in case there was an EAB outbreak in the UK. The spokesman said that it would follow the same approach used to tackle an outbreak of Asian longhorned beetle in Kent in 2012. And there was a Europe-wide network, known as Fraxback, that allowed scientists across the continent to share their research and findings. Although its efforts were focused on tackling ash dieback, it could provide information that could be used in terms of slowing or halting the spread of EAB. Dr Williams said that during his time in the Russian woodlands, there were signs that some trees may have a degree of resistance to EAB infestations. "European ash is supposed to be much more closely related to Asian ash species than North American species, so that resistance that Asian ash species has to EAB could well be part of genetic make-up of European ash," he suggested. "There was certainly some evidence within Moscow itself. We did not find many European ash but when we did find them, half were looking perfectly healthy. "Perhaps more interestingly, when we moved south into the forests where European ash is much more common, there was a much higher degree of variability in the trees' canopy condition. "This is the opposite of what you find in North American species of ash. When it is attacked by EAB, the dieback is so obvious it is startling. He added: "This suggests that it is perhaps not as susceptible to the beetle as North American species." </body>

      <title>Trees reveal hidden gold deposits</title>
      <description>The detection of gold in tree leaves helps to locate deposits buried in the earth, Australian scientists find, and it could also apply to other metals.</description>

      <body>Money might not grow on trees, but scientists have confirmed that gold is found in the leaves of some plants. Researchers from Australia say that the presence of the particles in a eucalyptus tree's foliage indicates that deposits are buried many metres below. They believe that the discovery offers a new way to locate the sought-after metal in difficult-to-reach locations. The research is published in the journal Nature Communications. Dr Mel Lintern, a geochemist from Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), said: "We've found a lot of the easy deposits in Australia and elsewhere in the world as well. "Now we are trying to tackle finding these more difficult ones that are buried beneath tens of metres of river sediments and sand dunes. "And the trees are providing us with a method to be able to do this." Buried treasure Gold particles have been found around the soils of eucalyptus trees, but the researchers confirmed that the plants were taking in the element. Using the Australian synchrotron - a vast machine that uses X-rays to probe matter in remarkable detail - they found traces of gold in the leaves, twigs and bark of some trees. The amounts of the precious metal were tiny. "We've done a calculation, and found that we need 500 trees growing over a gold deposit to have enough gold in the trees themselves to make a gold ring," said Dr Lintern. However, the presence of the particles pointed to greater riches buried more than 30m (100ft) below. Dr Lintern said: "We believe that the trees are acting like a hydraulic pump. They are bringing life-giving water from their roots, and in so doing, they are taking smaller dissolved gold particles up through the vascular system into the foliage." Currently, the metal is found in outcrops, where the ore appears at the surface, or it is detected through exploratory drilling. But the researchers said that analysing vegetation could offer a better method to find untapped gold deposits. Dr Lintern said: "Not only do we believe it is a way of stretching the exploration dollar further, because exploring for these deposits can be quite expensive, it also minimises the damage to the environment because we are taking a very small sample from the trees themselves, as well as the leaves and twigs on the ground." The researchers said the technique could also be used to find other minerals such as iron, copper and lead in other parts of the world. </body>

      <title>Greenpeace piracy charges 'dropped'</title>
      <description>Greenpeace activists held in Russia over a protest against Arctic oil drilling face lesser charges of hooliganism rather than piracy, officials say.</description>

      <body>Russia has dropped piracy charges against 30 Greenpeace activists, replacing them with hooliganism charges, according to officials. The new charge has a maximum penalty of seven years rather than 15. Greenpeace says it is still "wildly disproportionate". Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise vessel was seized by Russian forces as activists tried to scale an offshore oil platform. All 30 people on board were detained. Two of them are freelance journalists. So far all bail applications in the case have been refused. Vladimir Markin, the head of Russia's main investigating agency the Investigative Committee, told Russian news agencies that the charges had been reclassified. But the investigators did not rule out more serious charges at a later date - in particular the use of violence against officials. The refusal of the detainees to give evidence also gives the authorities reason to consider other offences such as terrorism and espionage, Mr Markin said. Last week, 11 Nobel prize-winners wrote to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to drop the charges of piracy. The presidential press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said the president had no power to influence the courts. Mr Putin said last month that the activists had violated international law but it was "absolutely evident that they are, of course, not pirates". Vladimir Chuprov of Greenpeace Russia said that there was no case for either piracy or hooliganism charges. "The Arctic 30 are no more hooligans than they were pirates," he said in a statement. "This is still a wildly disproportionate charge that carries up to seven years in jail. It represents nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest." Earlier Greenpeace Russia programme director Ivan Blokov told the Interfax news agency he was surprised the Russian government had refused to attend international court hearings in Germany over the detentions. The Netherlands took the case of the Dutch-flagged ship and its crew to the UN tribunal in Hamburg on Monday. The Russian foreign ministry released a statement pointing out that Moscow had opted out of UN Law of the Sea dispute procedures, which infringe upon sovereignty, in 1997. All 30 people who were on board the ship are in pre-trial detention in the northern port city of Murmansk until late November. They have complained of being held in harsh conditions, They were detained when Russian security sources stormed the ship five weeks ago following a protest against drilling for oil in the Arctic. Greenpeace denies any wrongdoing and is calling for the release of the detainees, who come from 18 countries, and the Arctic Sunrise. </body>

      <title>Lib Dems: PM panicking over energy</title>

      <body>The Liberal Democrats have accused David Cameron of making a "panicky U-turn" after he announced a review of green energy taxes. The prime minister said household bills were at "unacceptable levels" and promised to "roll back" regulations introduced by Labour. But a senior Lib Dem source said Mr Cameron had got "cold feet" on environmental policy promises. Labour also criticised the PM, but he promised to help cut people's bills. Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith said Mr Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband were "Muppets" in their attitude to energy policy. Three of the "big six" energy firms have announced price rises of between 8% and 10% in recent weeks and Mr Cameron has come under pressure to act, with Mr Miliband pledging to freeze tariffs if his party wins the next general election. On Tuesday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Cameron said he agreed with his predecessor that charges were "completely unacceptable" and said the government was already intervening in the market to force firms to put customers on the lowest tariff. But, rather than trying to dictate prices or influence the global cost of energy, he said the government's focus was on dealing with the aspects of energy bills it could control. Green taxes, he said, accounted for £112 of the average annual dual fuel bill and should be reduced. "We need to help people pay their bill and we need to help to get bills down," he told MPs. "We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills." The review would be followed by a competition test for the energy market to establish how it was functioning. Mr Cameron added: "I want more companies. I want better regulation. I want better deals for consumers. But yes, we also need to roll back the green charges that he [Mr Miliband] put in place as energy secretary [under Gordon Brown]." And, speaking to the BBC, he said the coalition had "made huge steps forward in terms of environment policy", but it was right to "look at rolling back the cost of some of these taxes, tariffs and charges". Downing Street said Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey would set out details of the competition review next week. But the Lib Dems, governing in coalition with the Conservatives, are keen to keep green taxes, arguing that they are essential to creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supply for the UK. A senior source told the BBC: "Everybody knows the Tories are getting cold feet on the environment. The Tories have put no properly worked-up policies in front of us. "But we will not allow a panicky U-turn during PMQs to dictate government policy. The way to provide stable fuel bills now and in the future is not to make policy up on the hoof." The source added that Lib Dems in the coalition would not "allow the Tories to undermine our commitment to the environment, hurt the fuel poor, or destroy our renewable energy industry". "Nick Clegg has always said that we should stress-test every policy to make sure that there isn't a penny more on bills than necessary," they said. "Of course, we will look at the specific details of what the Tories propose. That is coalition government." In the Commons, Mr Miliband said 60% of green taxes had been introduced by the current government and reminded the prime minister of his stated ambition to lead the "greenest government" ever. "He really is changing his policy every day of the week. His energy secretary says it is nothing to do with green taxes. And who is the man who said 'Vote blue to go green'? It was him." However, energy regulator Ofgem rejected Labour's claim that its retail market review had achieved nothing. A spokesman said: "We are introducing the most radical set of reforms to the energy retail market since competition began." He added: "The standards are backed by our powers to levy fines if suppliers don't meet these rules." According to government figures, environmental obligations account for 9% of the average £1,267 dual fuel bill, of which carbon taxes make up 2%. The cost of buying energy on wholesale markets makes up the largest proportion. at 47%. Energy firms say profits account for about 5% of an average bill. Asked whether the Lib Dems were signed up to a review, Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps told the BBC that they were "pragmatic" and wanted to see bills coming down. Friends of the Earth's head of campaigns, Andrew Pendleton, said the best way to cut bills was "ending the nation's dependency on costly fossil fuels". But John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the prime minister's review "could not only help households but also ease the pressure of high energy bills for millions of small businesses too". During a boisterous Prime Minister's Questions session, Mr Cameron was ticked off by Commons Speaker John Bercow for twice describing Mr Miliband as a "con man" in reference to his pledge to freeze bills for 20 months if Labour was elected. Firstly, he contrasted the Labour leader with the former Conservative prime minister, claiming: "Sir John Major is a good man. You are acting like a con man." And in response to a question from Conservative MP Brian Binley, he said: "It simply is the politics of the con man to pretend that you can freeze prices when you're not in control of global energy prices, but the proper approach is to look at what's driving up bills and deal with it." The Speaker said this was "unparliamentary" language and "a bit below the level" expected of a prime minister. Conservative MP and environmentalist Zac Goldsmith criticised both Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband, writing on Twitter: "In 2010, leaders fought to prove they were the greenest. Three years on, they're desperately blaming their own policies on the other. Muppets." </body>

      <title>Meteorite may solve Martian mystery</title>
      <description>A meteorite reveals clues to how Mars lost its thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere and became a cold, rocky desert, researchers say.</description>

      <body>A meteorite reveals clues to how Mars lost its thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere and became a cold, rocky desert, researchers say. They say the Lafayette meteorite shows signs of carbonation - where minerals absorb CO2 in a reaction with water. Mars lost its protective blanket about 4 billion years ago, perhaps because of the loss of its magnetic field, space impacts, or chemical processes. Carbonation may be the key factor, they write in Nature Communications. The process occurs naturally on Earth - and has been proposed as a technique for mitigating climate change, by capturing CO2 from the atmosphere. The 4.5cm Lafayette meteorite was discovered in Indiana, US in 1931, having plummeted to Earth about 3,000 years ago. It formed in the Red Planet's crust about 1.3 billion years ago, and was ejected from the surface by a massive impact. A team from the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC) performed microscopic analysis on a section of the rock - borrowed from the Natural History Museum in London. They found that silicate minerals, such as olivine and feldspar, had interacted with CO2-rich liquid water to form siderite crystals. The team says their discovery suggests liquid water was present on Mars more recently than some had thought. They also say it represents the first direct evidence for carbonation on the Red Planet - and ties in with the discovery of carbonates by Nasa's Curiosity Mars rover. "Carbonation could be the main force that turned Mars to stone," said lead author Dr Tim Tomkinson, of SUERC. "We can't say for certain it's the dominant cause - the loss of Mars' magnetic field may also have led to the stripping of its atmosphere by the solar wind. And CO2 is also frozen in the poles of Mars. "But carbonates do seem to be very abundant on the Martian surface." The loss of its carbon dioxide cloak is likely to have caused Mars to cool. So understanding how the CO2 was removed "could provide vital clues to how we can limit the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere and so reduce climate change" said Dr Tomkinson. Mineral carbonation is widespread on Earth. For example, in Oman's Samail mountains, weathering of peridotite rocks has been estimated to bind more than 10,000 tons of CO2 per year. Speeding up this natural process - by fracking rocks and pumping in purified CO2 - has been proposed as a technique for carbon capture and storage. "From our analysis of the meteorite, it seems that carbonation occurs in certain orientations - we see amazing saw-tooth edges, all lining up," Dr Tomkinson told BBC News. "It could be for example that if you wanted to frack rocks and introduce CO2 you should do it from a certain angle." Dr Caroline Smith, curator of meteorites at the Natural History Museum, said: "These findings show just how valuable meteorites from collections like those we have here really are. "There is so much important and useful scientific information locked away in these rare rocks. "Our study shows that as we learn more about our planetary next door neighbour, we are seeing more and more similarities with geological processes on Earth." </body>

      <body>A new colony of water voles has been captured on film using hidden cameras at a canal lock in Wiltshire. Ecologists from the Canal and River Trust spotted signs of the creatures during conservation works at the Caen Hill lock flight near Devizes. Laura Plenty, from the trust, said: "We decided it was a fantastic place to test our heat and motion sensitive camera to catch them in the act." The nationally-protected species is one of the UK's fastest declining mammals. Ms Plenty said the trust had been working to create the right habitat for the creatures in an attempt to reverse the decline in the water vole population. She said they knew there were some colonies on the canal near Devizes but had not been aware of this particular colony until the recent visit to Caen Hill Lock. She said they put the camera in place after "spotting a water vole latrine which is basically a big pile of droppings". "I couldn't believe it when we captured our first footage of the water vole," Ms Plenty said. "It clearly wasn't camera shy, as we managed to get further footage, with the vole even investigating the camera and knocking it over which happily lead to some fantastic shots of water voles hauling themselves out of the water. "Viewing the footage of the vole proves that this hard work has been worthwhile. "The fact that there's a new colony of voles living on the canal is the best reward we could ask for." Water voles like to live along canals and riverbanks so they can burrow to create complicated systems of underground tunnels and nesting chambers. A survey released by the Environment Agency and wildlife trusts in September, suggested that water voles had decreased by a fifth in the UK since 2011. Reasons for the declining population include habitat loss, predation by American mink and changeable weather. </body>

      <title>‘Most distant galaxy’ discovered</title>

      <body>An international team of astronomers has detected the most distant galaxy yet. The galaxy is about 30 billion light-years away and is helping scientists shed light on the period that immediately followed the Big Bang. It was found using the Hubble Space Telescope and its distance was then confirmed with the ground-based Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The study is published in the journal Nature. Because it takes light so long to travel from the outer edge of the Universe to us, the galaxy appears as it was 13.1 billion years ago (its distance from Earth of 30 billion light-years is because the Universe is expanding). Lead researcher Steven Finkelstein, from the University of Texas at Austin, US, said: "This is the most distant galaxy we've confirmed. We are seeing this galaxy as it was 700 million years after the Big Bang." The far-off galaxy goes by the catchy name of z8_GND_5296. Astronomers were able to measure how far it was from Earth by analysing its colour. Because the Universe is expanding and everything is moving away from us, light waves are stretched. This makes objects look redder than they actually are. Astronomers rate this apparent colour-change on a scale that is called redshift. They found that this galaxy has a redshift of 7.51, beating the previous record-holder, which had a redshift of 7.21. This makes it the most distant galaxy ever found. The system is small: about 1-2% the mass of the Milky Way and is rich in heavier elements. But it has a surprising feature: it is turning gas and dust into new stars at a remarkable rate, churning them out hundreds of times faster than our own galaxy can. It is the second far-flung galaxy known that has been found to have a high star-production rate. Prof Finkelstein said: "One very interesting way to learn about the Universe is to study these outliers and that tells us something about what sort of physical processes are dominating galaxy formation and galaxy evolution. "What was great about this galaxy is not only is it so distant, it is also pretty exceptional." He added that in the coming years, astronomers are likely to discover even more distant galaxies when Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is launched and other ground-based telescopes come online. Commenting on the research, Dr Marek Kukula, Public Astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, told BBC News: "This, along with some other evidence, shows that there are already quite surprisingly evolved galaxies in the very early Universe . "This high star-formation rate maybe is a clue as to why these galaxies can form so quickly." Prof Alfonso Aragon-Salamanca, from the University of Nottingham, added: "This is an important step forward, but we need to continue looking for more. "The further away we go, the closer we will get to discovering the very first stars that ever formed in the Universe. The next generation of telescopes will make this possible." But Dr Stephen Serjeant from the Open University said: "Chasing ultra-high redshift galaxies is a very exciting but equally very difficult game, and many claims of extremely distant galaxies have since turned out to be more nearby interlopers." </body>

      <title>Exoplanet tally soars above 1,000</title>
      <description>The number of observed exoplanets - those orbiting distant stars - passes 1,000 and of these, 12 might be habitable, scientists claim.</description>

      <body>The number of observed exoplanets - worlds circling distant stars - has passed 1,000. Of these, 12 could be habitable - orbiting at a distance where it is neither "too hot" nor "too cold" for water to be liquid on the surface. The planets are given away by tiny dips in light as they pass in front of their stars or through gravitational "tugs" on the star from an orbiting world. These new worlds are listed in the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia. The tally now stands at 1,010 new exoplanets, bolstered by 11 new finds from the UK's Wide Angle Search for Planets (Wasp). Abel Mendez of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico, said that although the number has rapidly increased in recent years, due to a lack of funding this figure is much lower than it could be. "We have more techniques and proven technology to detect more exoplanets, but the limit has been telescopes, especially space telescopes. "If we had more funding there would be more telescopes and that count would be much larger by now." The Kepler space telescope, which spotted many of these worlds in recent years, broke down earlier this year. Scientists still have to trawl through more than 3,500 other candidates from this mission so the number could rapidly increase. In January 2013, astronomers used Kepler's data to estimate that there could be at least 17 billion Earth-sized exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy. They said that one in six stars could host an Earth-sized planet in close orbit. The number of confirmed planets frequently increases because as scientists analyse the data they are able publish their results online immediately. But as the finds are not yet peer reviewed, the total figure remains subject to change. "Each night we get a list of astronomy papers where there might be an exoplanet announcement. When we get that we have to review it," explained Prof Mendez. This exoplanet catalogue is organised by Jean Schneider, an astronomer at the Paris Observatory. For the past 18 years he has catalogued new exoplanets on the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia. Others in the field, like Prof Mendez, are then able to review and comment on the findings, which makes it "more dynamic" he explained. "That's why the other catalogues just lag behind. The review is reliable as it's exactly the same as what the journals do." Prof Mendez told BBC News. Nasa will only accept those announced in an academic journal, so it updates its list far less frequently. Their tally currently stands at 919 confirmed worlds. Jean Schneider said it was also important to note that there was "no consensus for the definition of a planet" and that past experience had shown that a few objects declared as planets were actually artefacts or low-mass stars. "Some objects, like some Kepler planets, are declared 'confirmed planets' but have not been published in [referenced] articles. It does not mean that they will not be published later on, but it introduces another fuzziness in the tally," he added. Even if there was a generally adopted definition, Mr Schneider said that for some objects "there is a large uncertainty on parameters, so that the planetary nature of the object is uncertain". For Prof Mendez reaching 1,000 marks an important milestone in the quest to understand the history of the evolution of the cosmos. "I don't just want to know where the exoplanets are, I want to understand the stars, because they are the hosts for the planets. I want to understand the whole galaxy and the distribution of the stars because everything is connected," he explained. For him, the most exciting discoveries are Earth-like planets which could be habitable. "We want to know how unique our planet is, that's a big question and we are now closer than ever," he added. For Mr Schneider the most interesting is the candidate exoplanet around Alpha Centauri, as it is circling a star only four light-years away. This planet likely has the same mass as Earth but is outside the "habitable zone" as it circles its star far closer than Mercury orbits our Sun. </body>

      <title>Baldness cure a 'step closer'</title>
      <description>Scientists have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory.</description>

      <body>Scientists say they have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory. A joint UK and US team was able to create new hairs from tissue samples. Far more research is needed, but the group said its technique had the "potential to transform" the treatment of hair loss. The study results were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. There are baldness therapies including drugs to slow the loss of hairs, and transplants, which move hair from the back of the head to cover bald spots. The scientists at the University of Durham, in the UK, and Columbia University Medical Centre, in the US, were trying to actually grow new hairs. Their plan was to start with material taken from the base of a hair and use it to grow many new hairs. But human hair has been tricky to grow despite successes in animal studies. Whenever human tissue was taken from the dermal papillae, the cells which form the base of each hair follicle, the cells would transform into skin instead of growing new hairs. However, the group found that by clumping the cells together in "3D spheroids" they would keep their hairy identity. Tissue was taken from seven people and grown in 3D spheroids. These were then transplanted into human skin which had been grafted on to the backs of mice. After six weeks, new hair follicles formed in five out of the seven cases and some new tiny hairs began to form. Prof Colin Jahoda, from Durham University, told the BBC a cure for baldness was possible but it was too soon for men to be hanging up the toupee. "It's closer, but it's still some way away because in terms of what people want cosmetically they're looking for re-growth of hair that's the same shape, the same size, as long as before, the same angle. Some of these are almost engineering solutions. "Yeah I think it [baldness] will eventually be treatable, absolutely." He added: "It's hard to say exactly how long that would take, but the fact that we've done it now should reawaken interest." Any future therapy would involve transplanting cells which have been grown in the laboratory so safety is a concern. There would be a risk of infection and the cells could become abnormal, or even cancerous, while being grown. Baldness cures may not be the first application of the research. Prof Jahoda believes the findings will be used to improve the quality of skin grafts used after severe burns. Prof Angela Christiano, from Columbia University, said: "This approach has the potential to transform the medical treatment of hair loss. "Current hair-loss medications tend to slow the loss of hair follicles or potentially stimulate the growth of existing hairs, but they do not create new hair follicles. "Our method, in contrast, has the potential to actually grow new follicles using a patient's own cells." </body>

      <body>The US space agency has said it will allow Chinese scientists to attend an astronomy conference in California next month, reversing an earlier ban. Nasa put the earlier ban down to a misinterpretation of its policy on foreign nationals. Chinese officials had called the rejection of Chinese scientists' applications a form of discrimination. The event for scientists who research planets beyond the solar system will be held at Ames Research Center. The bar on Chinese scientists, revealed earlier this month, was prompted by new counter-espionage legislation restricting foreign nationals' access to Nasa facilities, Nasa spokesman Allard Beutel told the BBC. The conference will be attended by US and international researchers who work on Nasa's Kepler space telescope programme. The agency faced criticism from Chinese officials and US scientists who claimed Chinese students and researchers in their labs were being subjected to discrimination. In recent weeks, a growing number of US scientists decided to boycott the meeting in protest, with senior researchers withdrawing individually or pulling out their entire research groups. "The initial decision was based on a misinterpretation of the agency's policy regarding foreign nationals," Mr Beutel said. "We were able to clarify that interpretation and correct the decision, but it didn't happen until the federal government reopened last Thursday." Earlier this month the US government partially shut down operations for 16 days, putting hundreds of thousands of federal employees on leave. The counter-espionage legislation passed in March was part of a broad and aggressive move initiated by Congressman Frank Wolf, Republican chairman of the House of Representatives subcommittee that has jurisdiction over Nasa's budget. Mr Wolf later called Nasa's reading of the legislation "inaccurate" and sought to clarify the original intent of the law. "The congressional provision - which has been in place since early 2011 - primarily restricts bilateral, not multilateral, meetings and activities with the Communist Chinese government or Chinese-owned companies," Mr Wolf wrote in an 8 October letter to Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden. "It places no restrictions on activities involving individual Chinese nationals unless those nationals are acting as official representatives of the Chinese government," he wrote. </body>

      <title>UK first in heart failure operation</title>
      <description>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time.</description>

      <body>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time. Patients with heart failure struggle to pump blood around the body and mild exercise can leave them breathless. Surgeons used a form of "cardiac sewing" to remove scar tissue and reduce the size of the heart so it pumps more efficiently. The operation took place at King's College Hospital in London. One common cause of heart failure is when the arteries which nourish the organ become blocked, leading to a heart attack. Heart muscle dies and is replaced by hard scar tissue which does not beat. Over time, the scar tissue can stretch so chambers of the heart become larger, meaning the organ has more blood to force out with each heartbeat. The overall effect is a weaker heart, less able to do its job, transforming simple day-to-day tasks like climbing stairs into extreme exertions. In the operation, surgeons used a wire with anchors at both ends to pierce two sections of heart muscle. When the wire was tightened, the walls of the heart were "remodelled". The scar tissue was effectively removed and the volume of one of the chambers of the heart was reduced by a quarter. Sevket Gocer, 58 and from Bromley in south-east London, was the first patient to be treated in the UK. His heart function is said to have "improved significantly" after the operation. A similar procedure used to be performed by opening up the chest and stopping the heart, but it was a very risky operation and fell out of medical practice. Surgeons hope the less invasive operation, which can be performed while the heart is still pumping, will be a better option for patients. Mr Olaf Wendler, a professor of cardiac surgery at King's College Hospital, told the BBC: "In the technique we have now used for the first time in the UK, one does not need to stop the heart, one does not even necessarily need to place the patient on a heart-lung machine. "It's a less traumatic and less invasive type of procedure." He said the operation was being tested in a trial at hospitals across Europe and that the procedure could make a difference to patients' lives. He said: "[If successful] it's bringing them on to an exercise level where they're able to look after themselves properly including going to do the shopping and having a social life." Prof Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: "The results of this trial will determine if this experimental procedure is safe. "If the trial is successful, there will be further use of the technology as surgeons gain expertise in the technique. As more people are treated with this procedure, it will become fully clear whether it will have a real benefit for patients." </body>

      <title>'Electronic blood' computer tested</title>
      <description>A new brain-inspired computing device powered via a liquid instead of through wires has been demonstrated at IBM's Zurich laboratory.</description>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70552000/jpg/_70552415_8549310302_50612fbc36_c.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>IBM has unveiled a prototype of a new brain-inspired computer powered by what it calls "electronic blood". The firm says it is learning from nature by building computers fuelled and cooled by a liquid, like our minds. The human brain packs phenomenal computing power into a tiny space and uses only 20 watts of energy - an efficiency IBM is keen to match. Its new "redox flow" system pumps an electrolyte "blood" through a computer, carrying power in and taking heat out. A very basic model was demonstrated this week at the technology giant's Zurich lab by Dr Patrick Ruch and Dr Bruno Michel. Their vision is that by 2060, a one petaflop computer that would fill half a football field today, will fit on your desktop. "We want to fit a supercomputer inside a sugarcube. To do that, we need a paradigm shift in electronics - we need to be motivated by our brain," says Michel. "The human brain is 10,000 times more dense and efficient than any computer today. "That's possible because it uses only one - extremely efficient - network of capillaries and blood vessels to transport heat and energy - all at the same time." IBM's brainiest computer to date is Watson, which famously trounced two champions of the US TV quiz show Jeopardy. The victory was hailed as a landmark for cognitive computing - machine had surpassed man. But the contest was unfair, says Michel. The brains of Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter ran on only 20 watts of energy, whereas Watson needed 85,000 watts. Energy efficiency - not raw computing power - is the guiding principle for the next generation of computer chips, IBM believes. Our current 2D silicon chips, which for half a century have doubled in power through Moore's Law, are approaching a physical limit where they cannot shrink further without overheating. "The computer industry uses $30bn of energy and throws it out of the window. We're creating hot air for $30bn," says Michel. "Ninety-nine per cent of a computer's volume is devoted to cooling and powering. Only 1% is used to process information. And we think we've built a good computer?" "The brain uses 40% of its volume for functional performance - and only 10% for energy and cooling." Michel's vision is for a new "bionic" computing architecture, inspired by one of the laws of nature - allometric scaling - where an animal's metabolic power increases with its body size. An elephant, for example, weighs as much as a million mice. But it consumes 30 times less energy, and can perform a task even a million mice cannot accomplish. The same principle holds true in computing, says Michel, whose bionic vision has three core design features. The first is 3D architecture, with chips stacked high, and memory storage units interwoven with processors. "It's the difference between a low-rise building, where everything is spread out flat, and a high rise building. You shorten the connection distances," says Matthias Kaiserswerth, director of IBM Zurich. But there is a very good reason today's chips are gridiron pancakes - exposure to the air is critical to dissipate the intense heat generated by ever-smaller transistors. Piling chips on top of one another locks this heat inside - a major roadblock to 3D computing. IBM's solution is integrated liquid cooling - where chips are interlayered with tiny water pipes. The art of liquid cooling has been demonstrated by Aquasar and put to work inside the German supercomputer SuperMUC which - perversely - harnesses warm water to cool its circuits. SuperMUC consumes 40% less electricity as a result. But for IBM to truly match the marvels of the brain, there is a third evolutionary step it must achieve - simultaneous liquid fuelling and cooling. Just as blood gives sugar in one hand and takes heat with another, IBM is looking for a fluid that can multitask. Vanadium is the best performer in their current laboratory test system - a type of redox flow unit - similar to a simple battery. First a liquid - the electrolyte - is charged via electrodes, then pumped into the computer, where it discharges energy to the chip. Redox flow is far from a new technology, and neither is it especially complex. But IBM is the first to stake its chips on this "electronic blood" as the food of future computers - and will attempt to optimise it over the coming decades to achieve zettascale computing. "To power a zettascale computer today would take more electricity than is produced in the entire world," says Michel. He is confident that the design hurdles in his bionic model can be surmounted - not least that a whole additional unit is needed to charge the liquid. And while other labs are betting on spintronics, quantum computing, or photonics to take us beyond silicon, the Zurich team believes the real answer lies right behind our eyes. "Just as computers help us understand our brains, if we understand our brains we'll make better computers," says director Matthias Kaiserswerth. He would like to see a future Watson win Jeopardy on a level playing field. Other experts in computing agree that IBM's 3D principles are sound. But as to whether bionic computing will be the breakthrough technology, the jury is out. "The idea of using a fluid to both power and cool strikes me as very novel engineering - killing two birds with one stone," says Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey's computing department. "But every form of future computing has its champions - whether it be quantum computing, DNA computing or neuromorphic computing. "There is a long way to go from the lab to having one of these sitting under your desk." Prof Steve Furber, leader of the SpiNNaker project agrees that "going into the third dimension" has more to offer than continually shrinking transistors. "The big issue with 3D computing is getting the heat out - and liquid cooling could be very effective if integrated into 3D systems as proposed here," he told the BBC. "But all of the above will not get electronics down to the energy-efficiency of the brain. "That will require many more changes, including a move to analogue computation instead of digital. "It will also involve breakthroughs in new non-Turing models of computation, for example based on an understanding of how the brain processes information." </body>

Scientists working on an archaeological dig in St Brelade said teeth found at La Cotte suggest Jersey was one of the last places Neanderthals lived. The team of British archaeologists have unearthed items which show the presence of Stone Age hunters at the headland. They said the finds were helping scientists understand more about the early relatives of modern humans. A large portion of the site contains sediments dating to the last Ice Age, preserving 250,000 years of climate change and archaeological evidence. The site, which has produced more Neanderthal stone tools than the rest of the British Isles put together, contains the only known late Neanderthal remains from North West Europe. Dr Matt Pope of the Institute of Archaeology at University College London, who helped lead the research, said: "In terms of the volume of sediment, archaeological richness and depth of time, there is nothing else like it known in the British Isles. "Given that we thought these deposits had been removed entirely by previous researchers, finding that so much still remains is as exciting as discovering a new site." The team dated sediments at the site using a technique called optically stimulated luminesce, which measures the last time sand grains were exposed to sunlight. Dr Pope said the results showed that part of the sequence of sediments dates between 100,000 and 47,000 years old, indicating that Neanderthal teeth which were discovered at the site in 1910 were younger than previously thought, and "probably belonged to one of the last Neanderthals to live in the region". Professor Clive Gamble, from the University of Southampton and archaeology member of the Natural Environment Research Council, said: "Archaeologists need dates like an artist needs paint. Without a sound chronology the power of our other techniques for probing the past are severely restricted. "This is a great step forward on what looks like being a fascinating journey." The wider project, supported also by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the Jersey Government, will continue to investigate the site and material excavated from it over the past 110 years. </body>

      <body>Experts have found the first venomous crustacean - a centipede-like creature that lives in underwater caves. The blind "remipede" liquefies its prey with a compound similar to that found in a rattlesnake's fangs. It lives in underwater caves of the Caribbean, Canary Islands and Western Australia, feeding on other crustaceans. The venom contains a complex cocktail of toxins, including enzymes and a paralysing agent. The findings are detailed in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution. The remipede (Speleonectes tulumensis) breaks down body tissues with its venom and then sucks out a liquid meal from its prey's exoskeleton. Co-author Dr Ronald Jenner, a zoologist at London's Natural History Museum said: "The unique insights from this study really help improve our understanding of the evolution of animal venoms. "The spider-like feeding technique of the remipede is unique among crustaceans. This venom is clearly a great adaptation for these blind cave-dwellers that live in nutrient-poor underwater caves." Crustaceans are a large group of the wider category of animals known as arthropods. They include shrimp, krill, lobsters and crabs. Most are aquatic, but a few - such as woodlice - live on land. Dr Bjoern von Reumont, also from the Natural History Museum commented: "This is the first time we have seen venom being used in crustaceans and the study adds a new major animal group to the roster of known venomous animals. "Venoms are especially common in three of the four major groups of arthropods, such as insects. Crustaceans, however, are a glaring exception to the rule. "While they can be as varied as tiny waterfleas, krill, crabs and barnacles, not one of the approximately 70,000 described species of crustaceans was known, until now, to be venomous." </body>

      <body>A school has been forced to close because of an outbreak of Britain's most venomous spider. The Dean Academy, in the Forest of Dean, said it "had identified an issue with false widow spiders" in its ICT block and other areas of the site. A letter from vice-principal Craig Burns to parents said the school would be shut on Wednesday to be fumigated. Conservationists believe a change in the climate could be the cause of an increase in sightings of the species. In the letter, Mr Burns said the school had taken immediate pest control advice on discovery of the spiders. Initially the decision was taken to close the ICT block but further discoveries of the species elsewhere have led to a full school closure. "This will enable pest control to fumigate every area in the academy and ensure everyone's health and safety," Mr Burns wrote. "There have been no reports of anyone being bitten by the false widow spiders at the academy but if you have any concerns please seek medical advice." The school is expected to be open as normal on Thursday. The false widow (Steatoda nobilis) is about the size of a 50p coin and is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known in Britain. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Symptoms can include severe swelling, chest pains and tingling of fingers, with the severity depending on the amount of venom injected. Gloucestershire spider recorder David Haigh said people would have to be "very unlucky" to be bitten by one as they do not move very quickly and are not aggressive. He said he has never heard of a school being closed due to spiders, but said recent media attention on the False Widow has led to greater awareness. </body>

      <title>UN climate chief's tears over future</title>
      <description>A passionate concern over the world that children will inherit sees the head of the UN's climate body break down in tears.</description>

      <body>The head of the UN body tasked with delivering a global climate treaty broke down in tears at a meeting in London as she spoke about the impact of global warming on coming generations. Christiana Figueres told the BBC that the lack of an agreement was "condemning future generations before they are even born". Ms Figueres said this was "completely unfair and immoral". Despite the slow pace of negotiations, she said a deal can be done by 2015. Costa Rica-born Christiana Figueres has been the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for the last three years. Taking over after the failure of the talks process in Copenhagen in 2009, Ms Figueres has carefully steered the parties forward. Delegates agreed in Durban in 2011 that a new global deal must be signed by 2015 and come into force from 2020. But Ms Figueres' passionate approach to progress has been tested by the slow, tortuous UN process, where consensus is the only way forward. "I am always frustrated by the pace of the negotiations, I was born impatient. We are moving way, way too slowly, but we are moving in the right direction and that's what gives me courage and hope," she said. Speaking to the BBC on the sidelines of a climate conference at Chatham House in London, Ms Figueres became tearful when she reflected on the impact that climate change might have on coming generations. "I'm committed to climate change because of future generations, it is not about us, right? We're out of here," she said. "I just feel that it is so completely unfair and immoral what we are doing to future generations, we are condemning them before they are even born." "We have a choice about it, that's the point, we have a choice. If it were inevitable then so be it, but we have a choice to change the future we are going to give our children." She said that she was hopeful an agreement could be signed in Paris in 2015 but if that was going to happen, then significant progress had to be made in the next 12 months. There would need to be the draft text of an agreement when the parties meet in Peru in 2014. She said she was determined to avoid the mistakes that were made in the run up to Copenhagen in 2009, when expectations of a far reaching global compact faltered. "We are not going to have another Copenhagen - the leaders of the world are not just being brought in at the last minute, to face 300 pages of text that is completely impossible to digest. Next year would see a special climate summit of world leaders called by UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon. Ms Figueres is hopeful that this will clear the road ahead of the Paris meeting in 2015. "It is not going to be in Paris, going into all the technical details of how to build the agreement which is what we had in Copenhagen. The structure and logic of an agreement need to be in place. "This is way too complex and way too challenging to wait until the last minute in 2015." This year's Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC will take place next month in Poland. Some environmental campaigners are concerned that because of the country's heavy dependence on coal, it is less committed to strong action on climate change. Critics took issue with comments on an official website for the conference that suggested there were many positives to the unprecedented melting of Arctic ice, including the opportunity to chase "pirates, terrorists and ecologists". But Ms Figueres dismissed concerns about the meeting. "They have shown themselves to be very committed to this process, the COP president (Polish environment minister Marcin Korolec) has put in an extraordinary amount of time into learning and making himself familiar with the endless intricacies of this issue," she said.

      <title>Badger group disruption aids TB flow</title>
      <description>Badgers with TB spread the infection more easily to other badgers and to cattle when social groups are disturbed, a new study confirms.</description>

      <body>Badgers with TB spread the infection more easily to other badgers and to cattle when social groups are disturbed, a new study confirms. Vaccination has the potential to reduce the spread of infection without disturbing local populations, scientists report in Current Biology. The findings help explain why culling badgers can cause TB infection in cattle to rise, as infected badgers roam into new territory, they say. Pilot culls are underway in England. Badgers are being culled in west Somerset; with a decision due shortly on whether to extend a pilot cull in west Gloucestershire. In the study, researchers at the University of Exeter and the National Wildlife Management Centre at Woodchester Park, Gloucestershire, fitted 51 badgers in eight different social groups with electronic collars. They monitored the range of the wild badgers and their social interactions over the course of a year. The researchers were able to build a detailed picture of the social network of a wild population of badgers for the first time. We think of badgers as living in tight knit social groups and "sleeping in a big heap underground", but there is more complexity to it, said Prof Robbie McDonald of the University of Exeter, who led the study. "What our study shows is that social structure is very important for the transmission of infection in wild badgers," he told BBC News. "It also suggests that social stability is a good way of mitigating disease spread. So if you can intervene in a system and maintain social stability that's likely to be the best of both worlds." Vaccination does not disrupt social structure, he said, suggesting the social network in badgers - where relatively few individuals might be responsible for disease spread - lends itself to vaccination and could lead quite rapidly to herd immunity. "If you are trying to control disease, it may be advantageous not to disrupt social structure and so you could disrupt flow through those sorts of individuals by using vaccination," Prof McDonald added. "But of course vaccination doesn't do any good to an animal that's already infected." A 9-year trial found that culling badgers could reduce infection in cattle by 12-16% (after four years of culling and five years of follow-up). But if too few badgers are killed over too long a time period, TB infections in cattle can rise as badgers roam further afield to establish new social groups. Prof Rosie Woodroffe of the Institute of Zoology, London, said the study provided clarity about how badgers' social behaviour helps to constrain the spread of TB. "Genetic studies in the Randomised Badger Culling Trial found that culling increased badgers' movements, with especially marked increases for infected badgers," she said. "This new study helps to understand how such behavioural changes could prompt the major increases in disease prevalence which we saw as a result of culling. "The authors are right to highlight that their work shows how the benefits of badger vaccination are likely to be enhanced by badgers' social behaviour, because badger social networks are small and local, so vaccinating small numbers of badgers could still have benefits at a local scale. In contrast, culling disrupts badger social behaviour and spreads disease across the landscape." The Welsh government has chosen to vaccinate badgers in an effort to control TB in cattle, while the government policy in England is to cull badgers in high TB areas. Around 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in 2012 at a cost of £100m to taxpayers. Ministers and the NFU say culling is needed to fight bovine TB, but animal welfare and wildlife groups say scientific evidence does not support the policy of shooting badgers in an attempt to control the disease. </body>

      <title>Worldwide ban on bird pollutant</title>
      <description>A pollutant that killed thousands of birds off the coast of Britain earlier this year can no longer be dumped at sea after a worldwide ban was agreed.</description>

      <body>A pollutant that killed thousands of birds off the coast of Britain earlier this year will no longer be dumped at sea after a worldwide ban was agreed. More than 4,000 birds were killed or injured by the chemical polyisobutene (PIB) between Cornwall and Sussex, and on the Channel Islands. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has reclassified PIBs from 2014. It means ships will only be able to wash their tanks and dispose of all PIB residues while in port. Until now it has been legal for discharges to be made when vessels wash out their tanks, as long as they are further than 12 nautical miles from the nearest point of land. The ban had been recommended by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), on behalf of the government, and was welcomed by the RSPB, RSPCA and other wildlife charities. The decision was taken by the IMO at a meeting in London on Monday. "There was only one entry for PIBs before," said the IMO's Natasha Brown. "We are keeping the current category but will create a new entry for the high viscosity PIB, which is the problem chemical if you like, in terms of these discharges." The substance - a lubricant used to improve the engine performance of ships - was found on seabirds, mainly guillemots, in two separate instances between January and May. In the sea, high viscosity PIB becomes "glue-like", covering birds and restricting their movements and ability to feed, causing them to eventually die from hypothermia or starvation. In August, the MCA said it had been unable to trace the vessel the contamination spill had come from and closed its investigation. Adam Grogan, RSPCA senior wildlife scientist, said: "Our staff worked around the clock washing and treating these poor birds in January and April and it was heartbreaking seeing the pitiful state they were in. "Hopefully this will help stop incidents like these happening again, and save wildlife from suffering and dying like this in the future." Alec Taylor, from RSPB, said wildlife charities worked hard for the ban, with support from several south coast MPs. "But the huge support we received from members of the public, many of whom experienced the effects of this pollution first hand as they walked the beaches, was perhaps the clinching factor in achieving such a quick decision to prevent discharges of harmful PIBs," he added. The IMO is the United Nations agency responsible for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships. It consists of 170 member states, of which the UK is one. The organisation confirmed a number of other European countries had also been investigating the discharge of "high viscosity products" by chemical tankers, including PIBs. </body>

      <title>Dung beetle has galloping gait</title>
      <description>Three species of desert dung beetle move with a newly discovered "galloping gait", rather than walking like other insects, scientists say.</description>

      <body>Scientists have discovered that three species of dung beetle walk with a "galloping" gait not seen in any other insect. The vast majority of insect species walk with what is known as an alternating tripod gait - steadily moving forward three legs at a time. It is not clear why these flightless beetles have shifted so radically from the usual way of walking. The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology. The researchers wrote: "Like a bounding hare, the beetles propel their body forward by synchronously stepping with both middle legs and then both front legs." The beetles appeared simply to "drag" their back legs, they added. Dr Jochen Smolka, from the University of Lund in Sweden, who carried out the research in South Africa, was studying wingless desert dung beetles in order to find out how they navigated to their burrows. "We noticed that [one species we were looking at] was kind of bobbing along in a peculiar manner," he told BBC News. "At first we thought that maybe there was something wrong with it - that maybe it had some damage to its hind legs. "And then we noticed that all of the beetles of that species move like that most of the time." The researchers used high-speed camera to film the beetles' motion in detail. They then carried out tests in the lab, tracing the exact movement of the insects' legs as they walked across sandpaper. If the group of species the team was studying, known as Pachysoma, they found three species to have this same unusual gait. Dr Bill Sellers, who studies biomechanics at the University of Manchester, described the findings as "very peculiar". He explained that almost all of about one million insect species that have been described to science walk with the classic tripod gait. "They form a triangle with their legs," he explained. "So they have the left-front, right-middle and left-back legs on down at once, and then the opposite ones." "It's a very easy gait to control, and we know it's quite efficient." "So it's difficult to see why these beetles do what they do - it's a real puzzle." Dr Smolka and his colleagues carried out miniature time trials in their lab to see if this beetle was able to move any faster than beetles that walked normally. "But it turned out that the normally walking insects were up to 50% faster," he said. "What we're going to look at in the future is if it has something to do with their navigation." Their latest studies have suggested that the galloping beetles are able to stabilise their vision better when they are on slippery surfaces. "So it could be that if you're moving really fast [in a tripod gait], your head just moves from side to side so much that vision could be blurred," Dr Smolka explained. "Whereas in the galloping beetles, vision is always stabilised towards the front." </body>

      <body>A zoo's two new kittens could have a future role in a project to breed Scottish wildcats in captivity for possible release into the wild. Ness and Einich were born at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland's (RZSS) Highland Wildlife Park at Kincraig, near Aviemore. RZSS and the Aspinall Foundation are leading the plans for a conservation breeding programme. The wildlife park will be among the project's main breeding sites. RZSS said Ness and Einich may play a part in the programme, which is part of the wider Scottish Wildcat Conservation Action Plan unveiled last month and involves Scottish Natural Heritage. The cats are endangered in the wild. Breeding with feral cats, disease, habitat loss and fatal collisions with road traffic have caused a dramatic decline in their numbers. Only a few hundred pure-bred Scottish wildcats are thought to survive. Douglas Richardson, head of living collections at the Highland Wildlife Park, said the new kittens were the latest breeding success for the park. He said: "But with the wildcat action plan, the contribution that these little chaps may make in the future to their species' survival will hopefully be more impactful. "The plan is for a much more aggressively managed breeding programme, running alongside a wide range of other wildcat conservation initiatives that will eventually turn the tide for the species in Scotland." </body>

      <title>Monkeys 'take turns in conversation'</title>
      <description>Marmosets engage in what appears to be "polite conversation", taking it in turns to vocalise, according to researchers.</description>

      <body>Marmoset monkeys take it in turns to "talk" in a pattern very similar to human conversation, according to scientists. Researchers recorded the sounds of the marmosets as they called to one another from behind a curtain. Each animal would call, then wait for the other to respond before calling again. The results suggest an "alternative evolutionary route" for our own conversational turn-taking. They are reported in the journal Current Biology. It is something we take for granted in our conversations, but taking it in turns to talk and listen is crucial for us to effectively exchange information through what we say. Somewhat mysteriously though, we do not see an obvious origin in our closest primate relatives - the chimpanzees. Chimps are not very vocal and tend to use their repertoire of gestures to communicate, so it is widely accepted that these manual gestures provided the foundations for the co-operation inherent in our own communication. But Dr Asif Ghazanfar from Princeton University set out to look for evidence of a vocal route for this co-operation, by looking at vocal exchanges in marmosets. He explained that he chose marmosets precisely because, unlike chimps, they are very vocal. It is one of two main characteristics the monkeys share with humans, Dr Ghazanfar said. "They're [also] co-operative breeders - so they help one another take care of their offspring. "That's an important characteristic because it leads to greater pro-sociality (meaning the animals, like us, carry out behaviours that are intended to benefit others)." The lead researcher, Daniel Takahashi, recorded marmosets calling to one another from opposite corners of a room. The animals were separated by a curtain, so each could hear but not see the other. The recordings revealed that the marmosets would wait for about five seconds after the other finished calling to respond - seemingly following "unspoken rules of conversational etiquette". Dr Ghazanfar explained that there were two ideas for why the animals followed these rules. "One is, if you're out of sight of your group members and want to establish contact with another, you only know if you've established that contact if their response is contingent on your own," he explained to BBC News. "And the other hypothesis is that these calls they exchange might have information content [that needs to be digested]." Dr Ghazanfar says that our own conversational turn-taking might have evolved via a similar route - although on a parallel branch of the evolutionary tree. This provides an alternative explanation to the somewhat "mysterious step" it is suggested occurred as the patterns in chimp-like gestural exchanges evolved into the patterns of our own vocal communication. The team hopes that continued study of the marmosets will help to reveal more about why our own conversation can sometimes break down. "We are currently exploring how very early life experiences in marmosets - including those in the womb and through to parent-infant vocal interactions - can illuminate what goes awry in human communication disorders," said Dr Ghazanfar. </body>

      <body>Long before the Metro, the steam trains of Petite Ceinture ("Little Belt" in English) connected Paris's main railway stations carrying people around the city along the path of its ancient walls. The circular line went into gradual decline from the 1930s, when competition arrived in the form of the more modern underground Metro system. For 32km (almost 20 miles) the tracks of Petite Ceinture snake through bustling Paris, isolated and largely unseen from street level in deep trenches, long tunnels, and bridges. Nature has reclaimed the space and it has become a haven for wild flowers and animals. The line is officially off-limits to the public, but this hasn't stopped many people attempting to explore it. There is now a fierce debate in the French capital about what to do with the tracks and stations of the Petite Ceinture that still remain. A small section opened as a park in August 2013 and the mayoral elections offer competing plans for cycle routes and parks. Associations set up to preserve the space would prefer to see the line reopened for pedestrian services. BBC News joined Thomas Jorion - a photographer who has been documenting the line since 1996 - on a tour of what he calls the last great wasteland in Paris.

      <body>British and American researchers could be a step closer to finding a cure for baldness. Using mice, scientists have for the first time shown that it is possible to renew follicles capable of sprouting human hair. Professor Colin Jahoda from the University of Durham is one of the scientists behind the findings. He told BBC Radio 5 live's Breakfast: "It's not like a hair transplant where you're just moving follicles from one side to the other... they actually speak to the local cells around them and create a new hair follicle." </body>

      <body>The carcass of an elusive oarfish has been found washed up on a beach in California for the second time in a week. In a modern take on spoken tales, social media has lit up with talk of an ancient Japanese myth linking oarfish sightings to an impending earthquake. But how much truth is behind the myth? HJ Walker, from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California, told BBC Radio 5 live's Up All Night: "If there is a enormous giant earthquake beneath the sea, other fish would be affected - not just one or two oarfish." </body>

      <body>Scientists have discovered that three species of dung beetle walk with a "galloping" gait not seen in any other insect. The vast majority of insects species walk with what is known as an alternating tripod gait - steadily moving forward three legs at a time. It is not clear why these flightless beetles have shifted so radically from the usual way of walking. The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology. Describing this strange gait in their paper, the researchers wrote: "Like a bounding hare, the beetles propel their body forward by synchronously stepping with both middle legs and then both front legs." Here Dr Jochen Smolka from the University of Lund in Sweden, describes the findings. </body>

      <title>The area of outstanding beauty remade by man</title>
      <description>Should our woodlands be managed or left entirely in the hands of nature?</description>

      <body>A year after the first case of ash dieback in mature woodland - and with the disease spreading inexorably - experts are looking at ways to future-proof forests. Stroll around the Woodland Trust's Hucking estate (pictured in satellite views, above) near Maidstone in Kent and you could be forgiven for thinking little has changed in centuries. Sheep graze on the swathes of grassland between the gentle chalk hills. Pockets of ancient woodland carpet the hilltops and valleys. In reality, however, this seemingly timeless rural landscape is in constant flux and the effects of ash dieback will soon be all too apparent. Trees on the estate show the hallmarks of the disease in the black, shrivelled leaves hanging from the branches of diminutive seedlings and the magnificent ash trees that tower above. Ash dieback is spreading fast in this Area of Outstanding Beauty known as the Kent Downs, with trees bearing the scars of the chalara fungus. "See that lovely big ash up there," says site manager Clive Steward, pointing out a huge tree in a patch of ancient woodland. "Underneath it - see the big wide leaves - that's sycamore. It's just waiting to take over really. Because that's what will happen." Nature is poised to fill in the gaps if - as experts predict - millions of native ash trees die. Britain's forests have been through much turmoil in modern times, from the harvesting of timber for the shipbuilding industry to the arrival of pathogens such as Dutch elm disease in the 1970s. But the current speed of change is alarming ecologists. They say trees are facing unprecedented threats, with a recent increase in findings of new pests and diseases. Many believe it is only a matter of time before threats such as the emerald ash borer beetle, which drills into the trunks of ash trees, reach our shores. In an age of global trade and travel, rather than trying to stop these invaders, the key to safeguarding forests could be to closely manage them - and plant them to be resilient to future threats, be they a new pest, a violent storm, or climate change. Austin Brady of woodland conservation charity the Woodland Trust says to give a wood resilience a range of native species need to be planted, so if a pathogen strikes, at least some of the trees will survive. "For future healthy forests we need forests to have a wider range of native species growing there, so that all our eggs aren't in one basket," says Mr Brady. "So that if a particular pest and disease or issue comes along it won't destroy the whole forest. It might take out some of the components but there'll be enough different species of trees in there for the forest to survive." Maintaining diversity in the age of trees is also important, he says, as is maintaining connections between woods to give wildlife the space to thrive. The Hucking estate is seen as a pioneer of the idea of resilient woodland. A few decades ago, before the estate was taken over by the Woodland Trust, much of it was arable farmland, dotted with patches of ancient woodland. Careful management and planning has restored the natural landscape, with new trees planted to create corridors of habitat for animals and birds to roam. A mixture of native trees were used, which stand a better chance of withstanding tree diseases that are moving around the world. Mr Brady sees the practice as trying to "mimic nature". But some believe management in this way is artificial, and that nature will find its own level. Naturalist and writer Richard Mabey argues catastrophes like tree diseases are natural events, from which woods will recover without intervention. "Woody vegetation responds, adapts, regroups," he wrote in the New Statesmen. "What emerges in its recovery stage may not be the same as before, but it will always be a vital, dynamic, arboreal community. The same process will happen with ash, perhaps more quickly than we think." Joan Weber of Forest Research, agrees that "nature will fill in the gaps," as it did when elms disappeared, but this is more difficult when one particular species is dominant in a woodland. Austin Brady, however, says Britain's countryside has lost the great, untamed forests still present in countries such as Poland, with a corresponding loss of diversity. "You could make an argument for saying, let's leave forests to nature," he says. "The trouble is - we stopped leaving forests to nature in this country about 2,000 years ago. So we can't suddenly now say let's leave them to nature... we've taken away all the support systems that nature would have had in place." Others question exactly what resilience means. Managing a wood land to guard against the effects of tree diseases will not necessarily help other wildlife in the area, says Ray Dawes of the National Trust . "If you are going to change the tree species you are going to change the wildlife," says Mr Dawes, who believes the prescription for a healthy woodland varies. The National Trust has 400 properties with significant amounts of woodland in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and they are all different. "It's looking at individual woods - their origins, their values and the threats to them," he says. Back at the Hucking estate, Clive Steward spreads out an ordnance survey map over the bonnet of his dusty estate car to point out lanes in the Sussex and Kent weald that were carved by ancient farmers running pigs through the forests. Ash trees have left their mark on the map, recorded in names like Ashford and Asholt Wood. Local conservationists are preparing to record the impact of the ash tree on the landscape from a cultural perspective, in case it is lost. Nick Johannsen, director of the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, grew up during the era of Dutch elm disease, and remembers it well. "It's going to be a longer, slower, more lingering loss than elm was," he says. "But already beautiful ash trees are a shadow of themselves." Ash has long been part of our heritage, he says, used for the framework of early aircraft such as the De Havilland Mosquito, and tennis racquets at Wimbledon. "Not only is it extraordinary in its landscape and its wildlife importance - its natural heritage - it's also part of the cultural heritage of Britain. That's what we want to celebrate - because we are losing ash trees." </body>

      <title>Could Concorde ever fly again?</title>
      <description>Could Concorde ever take to the skies again?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24629451</url>
      <date>1382615025</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70641000/jpg/_70641820_183694639(1).jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Ten years ago today, our ever-shrinking world got a little bit bigger again. Three Concordes landed in a procession at Heathrow airport, while thousands of emotional fans looked on. After 27 years, the world's most famous plane had been pensioned off - first by Air France and then by British Airways - marking the end of supersonic passenger flight. So how is it that a noisy, polluting lump of aluminium, that was too pricey for most people to ride in, is still so popular? "It was probably more advanced than Apollo 11, which put the first men on the Moon." Jock Lowe is not only Concorde's longest-serving pilot, he's a former president of the Royal Aeronautical Society. "No military plane came anywhere close. It was so manoeuvrable and there was so much spare power, even ex-fighter pilots weren't used to it." Jock can't keep the joy out of his voice as he tells me what Concorde was like to fly. "The time we took it to the Toronto International Airshow, 750,000 people turned out to watch. I'll never forget that sight." He is modest about it, but Jock is part of an elite club. There are more US astronauts than there are Concorde pilots. Jock then recalled the time he was chatting to some pilots of the super-secret American spy plane, the SR71 Blackbird. Now, the whole point of that amazing aircraft was that it flew way beyond the reach of other planes. Faster and higher, hidden away. But one day, these guys said that their air traffic controller told them to get out of the way because there was a Concorde coming through. They couldn't believe it. Peering out of one window, two American military pilots wearing spacesuits. Peering out of the other, perhaps Joan Collins guzzling champagne - I'm guessing she was on the plane as she often was. I wonder if they waved? Technically, Concorde was revolutionary. It was the first aircraft to have computer-controlled engine air intakes. This may not sound much but it was one of the most significant leaps in aviation technology at the time. In any technology, in fact. It meant that they could slow the air down by 1,000mph in the space of about 15ft (4.5m). Without that, the engines would have blown apart. Concorde had carbon-fibre brakes. Again, the norm now, but back in the 1960s a technological marvel - and it was fly-by-wire decades before Airbus made that a mainstream technology. A decade on, there is still a lot of anger at the way Concorde was retired, with British Airways and Airbus, which was responsible for spares and maintenance, both often accused of pulling the plug too soon. Almost as soon as the final flights touched down, a campaign was launched to get her airborne again. And it is still going strong. The Save Concorde Group (SCG) wants British Airways to either help fund a heritage flight, or release an aircraft to someone else who will. BA still owns eight Concordes, which remain scattered in museums across the globe, from Barbados to Manchester. "The only real reason for Concorde's retirement was politics, and that remains the single obstacle in the way of her return to the skies," says Ben Lord from the SCG. He told me that he is certain he can get a Concorde flying again for £20m ($32m) and he reckons Sir Richard Branson would still help him out with the money. "I still have a wonderful desk model of the plane in full Virgin Atlantic livery," says Sir Richard in his latest blog. "But despite offering £1m for each aircraft (they were originally sold to BA by the British government for £1) sadly our friends at British Airways were having none of it - and decommissioned the planes in a way that makes any chance of them flying again an unlikely prospect!" Talking of money, let's scotch that myth that the great gas-guzzler did not make any cash for British Airways. Going back to Jock Lowe, he told me that up until that horrendous crash at Paris in 2000, she made a net average profit of about £30m a year. That is £500m net profit over her lifetime. And Jock insists that in her final few months before retirement, she was still making money. Still, he does not think Concorde will ever get airborne again. And when I spoke to British Airways the answer was the same as it has always been. No chance. "We firmly believe that the technical and safety challenges of returning a Concorde to the skies are absolutely prohibitive," says BA. So will we ever see her like again? Well, the world's two dominant planemakers, Airbus and Boeing, certainly do not plan to build something supersonic any time soon. But there other options on the horizon. Sir Richard Branson's space plane Virgin Galactic is due to take its first paying passengers next year and he is promising that within his lifetime, they will be able to fly people from London to Sydney in two and a half hours with minimal impact on the environment. One final thought. I asked Jock Lowe if they ever did aerobatics when they were testing Concorde. He said they did execute barrel rolls, but never a loop-the-loop, although the aeroplane was more than capable of doing it. Doubtless it would have spilled some champagne. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Green taxes</title>
      <description>What are they and how do they affect our bills?</description>

      <body>The past few months have been dominated by a debate over energy prices, with all the political parties coming up with ideas to try to bring them down. The prime minister has announced a review into how the government's climate change policies - so-called green levies or taxes - affect bills and whether they are delivering value for money. But what exactly are these green taxes and how do they affect our bills? UK household dual fuel - electricity and gas - energy bills in 2013 are estimated to be about £1,267, based on average levels of energy consumption. What is that made up of? The chart below shows what the Department of Energy and Climate Change says makes up (in % terms) the average household energy bill. So green energy measures make up 9% of that cost, or £112. The average price of gas and electricity paid by UK households has risen by about 18% and 9% in real terms since 2010 and by about 41% and 20% in real terms since 2007. The chart below shows all of the climate change policies that in some way increase energy bills. So people talk about green levies, but there are in fact lots of different things introduced over the past decade and a half. Some cost people money, some save people money and some do both for different groups of people. It wouldn't therefore be easy to repeal all of them at all (many, like the Green Deal are halfway through their operation and would presumably cost more to get rid of it in the short term than it would to keep longer term). Well, the government says that by 2020 the cumulative impact of their measures will save the average household some 11%. The graph below shows all of the policies and how much they will add or take away from a household bill. So with all those things taken together the Department for Energy and Climate Change say that this is what their effect will be on household bills: So far so good, the policies are saving households' money. But if we look at the effect the policy has on retail prices (rather than bills) - how much each household pays for every unit of energy it consumes - we have a very different picture. Impact of levies on Retail Prices (% change from baseline) On that picture households will be paying 41% more for their electricity bills as a result of green policies than the retail price is expected to be. How is that circle squared? Well, it comes down to government's projections that: So although the retail price will be higher as a result of green measures we'll also use less energy thanks to them. Moreover even if we take the initial figure of 11%, nearly half of that actually comes from changes to boiler regulations all the way back in 2002. If those are removed, then the other measures in place save much less - only about 6%. So if the government has got it sums wrong on how much energy insulation will save, householders could find themselves with a rather big headache in the years to come. The impact of green measures is more considerable on business than for householders. Businesses that are medium-sized users of energy currently face energy (gas plus electricity) costs that are on average between 15% and 21% higher as a result of policies. By 2020 the impact is estimated to be between 23% and 26%. Policies are estimated to be adding between 1% and 14% to energy bills for high-energy users in 2013 and between 6% and 37% in 2020. The range depends on their electricity/gas mix. The government has put several measures in place to compensate the most intensive users so as to try to prevent them from becoming uncompetitive in world markets. </body>

      <description>How dangerous is the false widow spider?</description>

      <body>A school has been closed because of a venomous false widow spider, and experts say they are on the increase. But how much of a threat do they really pose? Sightings of Steatoda nobilis, the false widow spider, are on the rise. It is being cited as Britain's most venomous spider, and it is spreading. But experts say the species is not usually aggressive towards humans and that being bitten is rare. The species is becoming more common and more widespread, says John Tweddle from the life sciences department at the Natural History Museum, London. He says that "it's not an influx as such, rather that existing populations are expanding". And being bitten by one is not very common, explains Dr Tweddle. It's much less common than a bee or a wasp sting. "There have been very few confirmed incidences of bites from Steatoda nobilis, although adult female false widow spiders are certainly capable of biting humans if handled without due care - the smaller males are not known to cause bites. "It is not an aggressive species towards humans and is most likely to bite when accidentally prodded or squashed, or trapped in clothing." The false widow is believed to have arrived in Britain in crates of fruit from the Canary Islands in the late 19th Century, with the first reported sighting in Torquay in 1879. The species has most likely spread as a response to a changing climate, adds Dr Tweddle. "We're expecting the species to continue to increase its distribution within the UK. We tend to spot spiders most frequently during the Autumn as this is when many of the UK's larger species reach maximum size, so are most visible." The symptoms of a bite range from feelings of numbness, severe swelling and discomfort, to various levels of burning or chest pains. The severity of the symptoms depends on the amount of venom that was injected. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Although a bite is very uncomfortable, it's no stronger than a wasp sting, says Mark Champion from the Wildlife Trust. There is also a greater chance of dying from a wasp or bee sting, he adds. "The bite that it gives is mainly defensive, so it's not coming out to get you, it's not a horror movie," he told BBC Breakfast.. "The swelling can become the size of a tennis ball. It can be something quite big but it's not something we all need to panic about." A footballer was recently bitten by a false widow in his sleep had to undergo surgery to cut away the area around the bite. One newspaper has also reported that a man was left fighting for his life after a bite on his foot. Sara Goodacre from the University of Nottingham's Spider Lab, says there seems to be a "disproportionate worry" about the creatures and that such media reports are "scaremongering". False Widows are extremely prevalent in France and Spain, yet there are rarely reports of holiday makers being bitten, Dr Goodacre told BBC News. Furthermore, she adds, some of the media reports of the bites are not consistent with the effect a neurotoxin - present in a false widow's venom - would have. Responding to the footballer surgery, Dr Goodacre says: "That's what you would need to do with a venom that's slowly breaking down the tissue, which some snake and spider venoms do - but not the false widow. "People aren't always reporting the same consistent symptoms. It's important to work out if we are talking about the same thing, or whether it's an allergy where the symptoms depends on the person that's bitten. "This [false widow's] neurotoxin doesn't seem to do that. At best it's very unclear, at worst it's scaremongering." The bottom line, Dr Goodacre says, is that the false widow spiders should not be a problem as they are not aggressive. "Some people are clearly having a reaction to something so the question is what is it? If there is a problem we should investigate it further." According to the British Arachnological Society, false widows might occasionally be the subjects of mistaken identify. "It is difficult to obtain accurate evidence as those complaining of bites often do not see the spider but assume they are the culprit because of the absence of a bee or wasp," said the society. "Alternatively, they only get a brief glimpse. Rarely is the spider captured so that an accurate identification can be carried out." </body>

      <title>When an operating theatre becomes a lab</title>
      <description>Why research is key to better surgery</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24388537</url>

      <body>Scientific research takes place in a lab, doesn't it? Well, not when the developments are in surgery. Then it takes place in the clinics, wards and even the operating theatre. In this week's Scrubbing Up, Prof Dion Morton, director of research at the Royal College of Surgeons, says it is crucial that patients understand how important the work is - and that they take part. When people think about clinical trials their first thought might be of laboratories where pharmaceutical companies test the safety and effectiveness of drugs and vaccines. But in surgery too, clinical trials are a vitally important way of assessing the benefits new treatments bring to patients. Research and clinical trials are a daily part of the NHS, with many studies carried out by doctors and healthcare professionals who treat patients on a daily basis. Although 98% of people in the UK will need surgery at some point in their lives, less than 5% of government funding for medical research goes on improving surgery and developing new techniques. Surgery has been referred to as the 'Cinderella' of medical research, although funding has been slowly improving in recent years. From treating acute trauma to replacing joints after chronic disease, surgery has a broad impact and still cures more cancers than any other form of treatment. It is a vital part of the health service and investment in research is crucial if we are to be at the forefront of improving patient care. This is why new surgical clinical trial centres have been set up across the country. Surgeons are currently recruiting patients to assess new surgical techniques and determine which procedures give patients the best chance of making a full recovery. Each centre will focus on many different types of surgery including transplantation, heart and orthopaedic. Trials are challenging to design and it can be difficult to recruit patients, but with careful planning and good communication they are made possible. I am working on an international study which aims to find out at what point patients with late stage bowel cancer should be given chemotherapy. Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK and patients currently have to have surgery first to remove the cancer and then have chemotherapy. However, when the disease is advanced, all too often the cancer returns in the months or years that follow. This trial will look at whether patients who are given some chemotherapy prior to surgery are less likely to see their cancer return in the two years after treatment. In Bristol, colleagues are running a trial to compare the effectiveness of two common operations to treat severe obesity - gastric band and gastric bypass. During the course of the trial doctors will study over 700 patients, of which half will have been fitted with a gastric band and half will have had a bypass. Over three years they will compare how much weight patients' lose, whether they experience any complications following surgery and to what extent their quality of life improves following the operation. Obesity is a rapidly increasing global health problem which costs the NHS billions of pounds. Surgery is both a clinically-effective and cost-effective way of treating this disease and so the results of this trial will help the NHS decide which of these two treatments they should offer to patients. Surgical research has the potential to make real improvements in the way we care and treat patients. Patient safety and innovation go hand in hand as it is the evidence gained from these trials that will ultimately lead to reduced patient mortality and sickness. Despite limited investment, surgeons are striving to develop the evidence for new techniques and procedures that can change the face of hospital care. Raising standards, delivering new surgical treatments to patients and delivering them safely nationwide is central to a high quality health service. </body>

      <body>The Siberian tiger: majestic, enigmatic - the classic big cat precariously balanced on the edge of extinction. Threatened by deforestation and poaching to supply the black market trade in tiger body parts, it is one of the most endangered cats on the planet. But over the past decade or so, a new threat has emerged - a silent, insidious one - canine distemper virus. Worldwide there are an estimated 400-500 Siberian or Amur tigers. Exact numbers are hard to determine because this is a reclusive animal that is rarely observed. Yet, at the turn of the century, some of these otherwise withdrawn animals were seen wandering onto roads and into villages in the Russian Far East. They were fearless and docile, confused and dazed; the antithesis of their usual ferocious and wary demeanour. Over the next few years evidence mounted that this, the largest living felid, was suffering from an infectious agent and the indications - the nature of the illness, historical understanding of wild cat infections and the diagnosis, in a single wild tiger, of a virus belonging to the morbillivirus genus - provided a likely culprit. A study published in the journal mBio, confirmed these suspicions. Genetic analysis of several dead tiger samples showed that canine distemper virus was the cause. Canine distemper virus (CDV), a relative of the human measles virus, was first described in dogs and infection causes fatal pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). But this virus is incredibly promiscuous and can infect jump into a variety of different animals - usually with catastrophic effects. Two suspected CDV outbreaks, the first in 1988 and a second in 2000, killed thousands of Baikal then Caspian seals. The virus has also ripped through Africa, with fatal outbreaks in silver-backed jackals and bat-eared foxes and catastrophic die-offs in wild dog populations that continue to this day. For years, cats were thought resistant to CDV. Yes, domestic cats could be infected in the laboratory, but this was inefficient and the virus was unable to pass from one animal to another. A massive demise in 1994 of African lions living in the Serengeti national park in Tanzania showed that this was fallacy. This population of closely monitored lions succumbed to CDV. Whilst only 34 lion deaths were documented during the outbreak, this was only the tip of the iceberg. Before CDV struck, the lion population numbered 3,000, but afterwards this had fallen by a third. In the same outbreak, countless hyenas, bat-eared foxes and leopards also perished. Add to this the recent report of infection of large numbers of South American jaguar and it is evident that this virus has little, if any respect for the so-called species barrier - the unique inherent host factors and properties that prevent viruses from jumping from one species to another. In an intriguing turn of events, CDV was also starting to spark fatal outbreaks in various primates. So what should we make of the emergence of CDV infection in primates. Is this an indication of the potential for a more compelling species jump? Could CDV do the unthinkable and infect humans? The simple answer is a resounding yes. At least, in theory it is. To replicate, a virus has to get into a host cell. It does this through interactions between proteins on its surface with proteins - receptors - on the surface of the cell. These receptors act as gateways into the cell and if the virus protein fits then infection takes place. Different animals possess slightly different versions of these receptors on their cells so the virus proteins also have to change to be able to unlock them. A single mutation in one of surface proteins in CDV present in primates is all it takes for the virus to successfully use the human receptor. This is a tiny species barrier. But before banishing the pet dog to a high containment kennel then donning personal protective clothing before you go near, there's a key part of the story we need to consider - one that's probably been protecting us for all of these years. When you're exposed to a virus your body recognises it as foreign and your blood cells generate antibodies which bind to the virus surface proteins and protect us from infection. It's the basis for vaccination. Fortunately, the surface protein of the measles virus is so similar to CDV that antibodies generated by the measles vaccine also protect against CD; and other morbilliviruses too. But, if we ever eradicate measles and stop vaccination, maybe then we will be susceptible to CDV. But what of the Amur tiger - will CDV ensure its ultimate demise? As Dr Denise McAloose, lead author on the mBio paper, explained: "When you're talking about four to five hundred animals and your losing reproductive females and their offspring, the overall impact on populations is huge. "Some of the earlier modelling work, if it were to pan out, does suggest that this is a significant disease even at the levels of disease we are detecting now, which is probably just the tip of the iceberg." A bleak outlook that is shared by a University of Nottingham colleague, veterinary virologist Dr Rachael Tarlinton: "Because they are such tiny populations even relatively small mortality events can seriously harm their genetic diversity and this might just be enough to push them over the edge." Hopefully it's not too late. We know that CDV vaccines work and a targeted vaccination programme might just pull Amur tigers back from the brink. Current CDV vaccines have to be injected - no trivial task when the animal you want to protect is so difficult to track down and so dangerous to handle. But not all vaccines need to be injected - some very effective vaccines have been developed for oral delivery and these have been pivotal in our fight against rabies. In the late 1970s, Switzerland pioneered the widespread deployment of enticing baits laced with rabies vaccine that would be eaten by rabies-susceptible wild animals, thereby protecting them. So successful was this approach that following a similar campaign that spanned more than two decades, Germany was declared rabies-free. Whilst development of an oral vaccine is scientifically feasible, it is unlikely ever to become a reality. As Dr Tarlinton explains: "It was worth developing the oral bait vaccines for rabies because of the human zoonosis risk, but something for a purely veterinary disorder, particularly one that infects wildlife rather than livestock? It's difficult to justify the economics of doing it, even if we should." Even though vaccinating tigers is unfeasible there is an alternative: identify the reservoir and remove the virus at source through vaccination campaigns. This has proven very effective in protecting CDV-threatened lion populations in Africa. But do we know what the reservoir is? Domestic dogs have been implicated in all epidemics involving wildlife but, because the virus can infect other animals, you have to be sure. And this is what Dr McAloose and her colleagues have turned their attention to. "We have to understand if there's a reservoir. "We're trying to identify how the virus is cycling through the system to understand what the carriers are, and only with these results would we be able to make the appropriate recommendations." For the sake of the Amur tigers, I wish them well in their quest. </body>

      <title>India Mars launch stokes space race</title>
      <description>India's mission to Mars set to stoke fires of new Asian space race</description>

      <body>The forthcoming launch of a spacecraft to Mars by India is likely to stoke the fires of a burgeoning Asian space race. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is making its final preparations to send an orbiter to the Red Planet. The principal aim is to test out India's space technology to see if this emerging space-faring nation is capable of interplanetary missions. The spacecraft will also collect scientific information about the planet's atmosphere and surface. The Mangalyaan probe was to have been launched as early as 28 October, but rough weather in the Pacific forced officials to delay the launch by a week. The unmanned mission has a launch window lasting until 19 November. If the mission succeeds, ISRO will become only the fourth space agency, after those in the US, Europe and Russia to have successfully sent a spacecraft to Mars. According to Pallava Bagla, science editor of New Delhi television news and author of a book about India's space efforts, Destination Moon, the country's public are especially excited about the possibility of beating China to the Red Planet. "If India does beat China to Mars you can imagine the national pride," he told BBC News. The mission was announced in August last year by India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during his independence day speech, delivered from the ramparts of one of New Delhi's most iconic buildings - the Red Fort. "Anything said from the ramparts of the Red Fort is always replete with national pride and national pride is written very largely and boldly on this mission," according to Mr Bagla. In 2011, a Chinese attempt to send a spacecraft named Yinghou-1 to Mars was aborted because of a technical problem. The Indian space agency then fast-tracked its Mars mission, called Mangalyaan, readying it in just 15 months. India has had a space programme for more than 30 years. Until recently, its priority has been to develop technologies that would directly help its poor population, such as improving its telecommunications infrastructure and environmental monitoring with satellites. But in 2008, ISRO translated its formidable capability to build and launch satellites toward exploration and send a probe to the Moon, Chandrayaan-1. The lunar mission cost more than £55m. Now the government has spent a further £60m to go to Mars. Some have questioned the government's shift away from building infrastructure towards exploration, and wonder whether the money could have been better spent. It is a point that draws this robust response from Mr Bagla: "You can't bring the 400 million people who live in poverty in India out of poverty with this £60 million," he says. The shift towards exploration is also a hard-headed one by officials in the hope that it will have clear economic benefits, according to Prof Andrew Coates, who rejoices in the impressive title of "Head of the Solar System" at the Mullard Space Sciences Laboratory in Surrey, part of University College London. "The exploration programme gives them something very high to aim for. If they can show the world they have what it takes to send spacecraft to other planets they can begin to sell launches and space on its launch vehicles to scientific organisations. It also brings India to the table of international space science exploration," Prof Coates explained. Developing satellites and developing launchers is now big business. If India, or for that matter China, ease up on their investments in space exploration there is a risk that they could lose out, not least on the vital expertise that this cutting edge endeavour brings to their respective countries. Sandeep Chachra, executive director of the poverty eradication charity Action Aid in India believes that investment in space exploration could potentially benefit the country's poorest. "Investing in new technology, including space technology is an important part of the aspirations for an economy such as India. Developing a sophisticated technological base in a country with this level of poverty is not a simplistic contradiction " he told BBC News. "What is important is to harness the advances that science and technology bring for the greater good and to use those advances to overcome ingrained poverty and build hope for future generations". China though remains the greater power in space. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has a well developed astronaut programme and an orbiting laboratory called Tiangong-1. The CNSA is planning to send its Chang'e-3 spacecraft and accompanying rover to the Moon in December. The mission is part of an ambitious plan to send more robotic probes to the Moon with a view to eventually sending astronauts to the lunar surface. The Japanese Space Agency (Jaxa) is also a major force in the region. It is by far the most experienced Asian space agency, with numerous unmanned scientific interplanetary missions under its belt. "India, China and Japan are certainly eyeing each other up," says Prof Coates. The growing rivalry is likely to see a new boom in space exploration - one that will eventually lead to more collaborative missions between the emerging space-faring nations in Asia. That might eventually lead to a truly global effort to send astronauts to Mars. Follow Pallab on Twitter </body>

      <body>A 3D printer and suspected "homemade" gun components seized during police raids in Manchester are being examined. Detectives initially said the parts were a "plastic magazine and trigger" which could make a "viable" gun. But the man held on suspicion of making gunpowder has told the BBC they are actually sections of a 3D printer. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) now say they "cannot categorically say" whether they had recovered the component parts for a gun. A force spokesman said if the tests showed the parts could make a functioning weapon it would be the "first ever seizure of this kind in the UK". Det Insp Chris Mossop, of GMP, said: "If what we have seized is proven to be viable components capable of constructing a genuine firearm, then it demonstrates that organised crime groups are acquiring technology that can be bought on the high street to produce the next generation of weapons. "In theory, the technology essentially allows offenders to produce their own guns in the privacy of their own home, which they can then supply to the criminal gangs who are causing such misery in our communities. "Because they are also plastic and can avoid X-ray detection, it makes them easy to conceal and smuggle." He added: "If what we have seized today can, as we suspect, be used to make a genuine firearm then today will be an important milestone in the fight against this next generation of homemade weapons." The BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said the discovery was "almost inevitable" because of the relatively few firearms in circulation. "The worst-case-scenario would be a cheap and 100% reliable device that could be made overnight and then destroyed after just one use, disposing of crucial evidence to pin to a suspect," he added. The raid was part of GMP's Operation Challenger, which aims to "dismantle" organised criminal gangs. Counterfeit goods worth £2m, more than £330,000 of drugs and £25,000 cash, have been seized in a crackdown. 3D printing technology works by building up layer upon layer of material - typically plastic - to create complex solid objects. Desktop 3D printers can be bought on the high street for less than £1,000, but prices can be as high as £10,000. The world's first gun made with 3D printer technology was successfully fired in the US in May. The group that created the firearm, Defense Distributed, said it planned to make the blueprints available online. Defense Distributed is headed by Cody Wilson, a 25-year-old law student at the University of Texas, who defended making the design available by saying: "I'm seeing a world where technology says you can pretty much be able to have whatever you want. "It's not up to the political players anymore." At the time, Europe's law enforcement agency Europol said it feared criminals would follow suit as the technology became cheaper and more user friendly. </body>

      <body>A teenager who died after jumping from a ferry on New Year's Eve may have done it as a result of alcohol-fuelled bravado, a coroner says. Jordan Cobb, 16, from Plymouth, was with friends when he went into the River Tamar from the Torpoint ferry near the Cornish shore. The inquest in Plymouth heard claims it might have been over a £100 bet. Ruling accidental death, coroner Ian Arrow said Jordan made his own decision and he was sure he did not mean to die. "We can't be certain why he dived off, whether it was bravado or for some other reason. I am satisfied he certainly didn't expect to die," Mr Arrow said. Jordan had been drinking with friends in Plymouth before the group decided to head to Torpoint, the hearing was told. He was filmed on CCTV leaping into the river at about 21:15 GMT. Witnesses told the coroner the group had moved towards the front of the ferry as it approached Torpoint when Jordan said "something like 'shall I jump off?'", but the comments were not taken seriously. He then asked a friend to hold his bag, climbed on top of a barrier and dived overboard. Witnesses saw Jordan go underwater and re-emerge to begin swimming for the shore before losing sight of him. Daily searches involving the police, coastguard and the Ministry of Defence were carried out after Jordan, who went to the city's Stoke Damerel Community College, vanished. His body was found on 16 January. The inquest heard a witness statement from two girls on the Torpoint side of the river, which claimed they heard a male who was part of Jordan's group say: "It was a £100 bet ... it was supposed to be me, but Jordan jumped in." Torpoint ferries are pulled across the River Tamar on chains and are an important travel link between Plymouth, Devon and Torpoint in Cornwall. </body>

      <title>Firefighters to stage more strikes</title>
      <description>Firefighters in England and Wales are to strike on 1 and 4 November in a row over pensions, the Fire Brigades Union says.</description>

      <body>Firefighters in England and Wales are to stage two more strikes in the run-up to bonfire night in a row over pensions, the Fire Brigades Union says. The government wants firefighters to work up to 60 but the union says this is too old to be fighting fires. FBU members are due to walk out on 1 November from 18:30 to 23:00 GMT and on 4 November from 06:00 to 08:00 GMT. In the first round of action last month, 32,000 union members in England and Wales walked out, the FBU said. A second strike was called off earlier this month after progress was made during talks. The FBU postponed the five-hour strike saying that the government and fire employers had shifted their position and recognised that firefighters faced losing their jobs and a "large chunk" of their pensions under new changes imposed in April. However, the FBU now says the government and fire employers have failed to offer any firm guarantees on jobs or pensions. FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said: "The Westminster government has created this mess, but it is refusing to clear it up. "It now recognises the problem but it won't provide the legal and financial guarantees firefighters need to ensure they have a job and an unreduced pension in the future. "Firefighters face the sack towards the end of their career and the loss of their pension. That can't be right. "The employers promised to tackle the issue of firefighters facing the sack for failing fitness tests last week, only to say they can't offer any guarantees this week. "That is simply not the way to run a public service. "The government is now making threats to withdraw some of the other concessions they have made this year." London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson said it was prepared to deal with further strikes and would have 27 fire engines based at strategic points across the capital. "The evening strike date falls on the Friday before bonfire night. It is just before Diwali and coincides with half-term, so people need to be really careful with fireworks and bonfires," he said. During the first strike on 25 September, contingency plans at the 46 fire services in England and three in Wales included using part-time and volunteer firefighters, calling in non-union fire crews and bringing in private contractors. The armed forces had a back-up role and in the event of a major incident, union members could have returned to work. No major incidents were reported during the four-hour strike which was the first national walkout for a decade. </body>

      <description>A Royal Navy officer who was skippering a racing yacht that hit an oil tanker in the Solent is found guilty of contravening maritime regulations.</description>

      <body>A Royal Navy officer who was skippering a racing yacht that hit an oil tanker in the Solent has been found guilty of contravening maritime regulations. The Atalanta of Chester, belonging to Lt Roland Wilson, of Stanley, Perthshire, collided with the 260m-long Hanne Knutsen during Cowes Week 2011. The 32-year-old was convicted at Southampton Magistrates' Court of impeding the passage of a vessel. He was also found guilty of failing to keep a proper lookout. Mr Wilson, who was a serving Royal Navy officer at the time but is now a lieutenant in the reserves, had seen the tanker from five miles (8km) away, the court heard. It had been making its way to Fawley oil refinery. Wilson had told the court the ship had signalled to turn but never did, describing its manoeuvre as "unexpected". District Judge Anthony Callaway said he took the wrong decision in continuing towards the path of the tanker and not taking evasive action. The moment of impact was filmed and the video posted on YouTube, where it was watched more than 924,000 times. Mr Callaway said: "Fortuitous it was that there was no loss of life. The potential for even greater and tragic consequence is, in my judgement, apparent. "This was a serious yacht crewed by serious people in a regatta for a serious purpose. It was well equipped in terms of experience and ability to deal with any situation. "This was not some Saturday afternoon jaunt by some inadequate vessel crewed by inexperienced, clueless and foolhardy people who frankly have no business being on the water at all. "The yacht took a decision, and as I find the wrong decision, to sail towards the problem into the path of the tanker across a narrow channel. It should have kept clear and in the worst event used her engine." The judge said conditions in the Solent were crowded due to Cowes Week but the yacht's crew were experienced enough to perform the "difficult manoeuvre". He added: "The fact it didn't do so was the product not of a lack of skill, but the product of the wrong decision at the wrong time, for which the skipper, Roland Wilson, must take responsibility." Mr Wilson was ordered to pay a fine of £3,000, and costs of more than £100,000. The yacht, which had a crew of eight, suffered a damaged mast and its sail almost became entangled in the anchor of the Hanne Knutsen. One crew member suffered minor head injuries and another abandoned ship after the collision with the 120,000-tonne tanker. Mr Wilson was convicted of one count of failing to keep a proper lookout and two counts of impeding the passage of a tanker in a restricted channel. </body>

      <body>The chair of governors of the under-fire Al-Madinah Muslim free school has announced she is stepping down. Ofsted inspectors had described the school in Derby as "dysfunctional" and rated it inadequate in every category. The inspection had been brought forward by the agency after fears were raised about teaching standards. Shazia Parveen said she would step down at the "end of a period of transition" and acknowledged the weaknesses identified by Ofsted. In a statement, she said: "The future of our children starts now." The Ofsted report, published on 17 October, said the school required special measures and that the teachers were inexperienced and had not been provided with proper training. Al-Madinah Education Trust said it accepted the report and would use it to move forward. Ms Parveen said in her statement: "Over the last few years, I have sacrificed my own time, family and health for this noble cause - to help educate the children of our communities. "The future of our children starts now. Much has been said about our school. We, the governing body, have tried our best. "We acknowledge the weaknesses within our school and have taken the Department for Education (DfE) recommendations very seriously. "I plan to step down from my position as chair of the governing body as soon as the transition is over and this is clearly for the best interests of our children. "In conclusion, we are ready to learn from our mistakes but not willing to fail our students." A Dfe spokesman said: "We were already investigating this school before allegations became public. We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection." Labour's shadow schools minister Kevin Brennan MP said following reports of Ms Parveen's resignation: "Another day, another episode in David Cameron's flailing flagship education programme. "Al-Madinah is a symbol of all that is wrong with Cameron's free schools. "Labour has long warned of the dangers: a lack of oversight, allowing unqualified teachers to teach on a permanent basis, and spending on free schools ahead of addressing the chronic shortages in primary school places." Mr Cameron had said the Derby school should not be used "as a stick with which to beat the whole free school movement". He added there were many free schools that had on average more outstanding and good ratings than established schools. The Ofsted report followed a letter to the Trust on 8 October by Education Minster Lord Nash that laid out 17 issues. These included forcing female teachers to cover their hair and failing to carry out background checks on staff. He said funding would be pulled if urgent steps had not been taken within seven days. However, the trustees now have to provide an action plan to show how fit they are to run the school, and how it will improve, by 1 November. </body>

      <title>Surgery offer for ex-'fattest man'</title>
      <description>A US surgeon offers to remove excess skin from a British man once dubbed the world's fattest.</description>

      <body>A plastic surgeon in the US has offered to operate on a British man once dubbed the world's fattest. At his heaviest, Paul Mason weighed 70 stone (444kg) and was bed bound at his bungalow in Ipswich, Suffolk. He now weighs about 24 stone (152kg) after gastric bypass surgery in 2010 but says his life is being hampered by a huge amount of excess skin. New York-based surgeon Dr Jennifer Capla said she was willing to donate her time to help Mr Mason. In May, Mr Mason, 52, released photographs of his naked body as part of his plea for medical help. Mr Mason said he had begun trying to raise the money to pay for flights and a hospital stay in order to take advantage of Dr Capla's offer. Dr Capla told BBC Radio Suffolk she had read about Mr Mason and his weight loss in the New York Times. "He is a high-risk patient and he has a lot of medical issues that we need to sort through," she said. "However, he's a great candidate for this skin removal surgery. "He has lost over 600lbs (272kg) and he should be very functional and mobile and should be able to live his life but he's still wheelchair-bound because he has all this excess skin. "Helping him get his life back is really the goal." Dr Capla said she specialised in "post-bariatric body contouring" but that although she had treated patients who has lost up to 200lbs (90kg) she had never treated anyone who had lost as much weight as Mr Mason. "The skin is the same in terms of looseness and the areas of target so it's an area I'm very familiar with," she said. Mr Mason said he had "things in motion" to raise the money needed. "All I've got to cover is the medication, the stay in hospital and the flights," she said. Mr Mason has not been able to have the surgery on the NHS because his weight has not been stable. He said an operation to remove excess skin around his middle would make a huge difference. "I would be able to mobilise and lead a reasonably normal life, then have my arms and legs done," he said. "Five years down the road it would possibly have to be repeated because by then I should be at my goal weight and the excess skin I would have then would still need removing because of the extreme size I was in the first place." A spokesman for the NHS Ipswich and East Suffolk Clinical Commissioning Group said: "Before a patient has an operation it is important to take a balanced decision that is in the best interest of that patient. "In cases like this the NHS has a panel of people - including clinicians - who decide whether the patient should have such an operation. A patient must have a stable weight before he or she is considered." </body>

      <body>Hundreds of mourners packed a church for the funeral of a football coach who was stabbed to death. Antoin Akpom, 20, was knifed in Kent Street, Leicester, on 12 September. In a statement read out before the service began at 10:00 BST, the family said they wanted people to remember him for the "wonderful person he was". Tributes were paid to Mr Akpom by his parents, sisters and fiancée, as well as city dignitaries including the Bishop of Leicester. The family statement read: "We are here today to say farewell and lay to rest a wonderful son, a loving partner and an adoring father. "His death at the age of 20 has been a devastating blow to his family and friends but they want people to remember him for the wonderful person he was. "Someone who loved sport and music, someone who coached and mentored countless school children, someone who was an inspiration to everyone who met him. "Even in death, Antoin is bringing together and uniting so many people all around Leicester. "Many people are working hard to see that his death is not in vain and that the good work he was doing continues. This is his legacy." The two-hour long funeral started with a recording of his mother Cheryl Armatrading singing The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face before hymns were sung and tributes were paid. Also speaking were Sir Peter Soulsby, the city's mayor, and Keith Vaz, the local MP. Mr Akpom worked as a primary school teacher, volunteered as a youth team coach for Leicester Nirvana FC and had also set up a sports coaching business with his best friend Joe French. "The funeral for any person as young as Antoin is always going to be not right because it should not be happening," said Mr French. The Right Reverend Tim Stevens, Bishop of Leicester, said: "We need to encourage the many young people there, his friends and all those who have been touched by his life, that there is hope and a real purpose in building the future of our city, "Even though it is shocking and a deep injustice has been done, we don't do anything to repair that through thoughts of revenge or the creation of conflict. "We repair that through thoughts of reconciliation and I am sure that is what our families want and what those who knew Antoin will want as well." Two men have been charged with Mr Akpom's murder and are next due to appear in court in January. </body>

      <body>A widower from Cheshire has been ordered to pay £3,500 compensation to a carer who had her hours cut when his wife died. Jayne Wakefield was paid for 30 hours a week to care for George Lomas, 77, from Scholar Green and his wife Rose, who had Parkinson's disease. Mr Lomas reduced her weekly hours to 16 after Mrs Lomas, 76, died in March. Mrs Wakefield was awarded damages after she sued him for constructive unfair dismissal and breach of contract. She was originally paid using money from Cheshire East Council, which had funded Mrs Lomas's care package. The council stopped the funding when she died so Mr Lomas agreed to pay Mrs Wakefield privately, which meant he was legally classed as her employer. No details of the payments were put into writing. Mrs Wakefield resigned after her hours were reduced to 16 a week by Mr Lomas. Her claim for breach of contract and unfair dismissal was initially dismissed but Mrs Wakefield won her case on appeal at an employment tribunal in Birmingham. Mr Lomas, from Congleton Road, said he was "gutted" by the decision. He said: "I can't understand why the judgement went against me because I couldn't have insured against redundancy, which seems to be the stumbling block. "How it's going to be paid, as yet, I just don't know." Cheshire East Council said it was not liable for any claims as a result of the case. Mrs Wakefield could not be reached for comment. </body>

      <body>The company in charge of a Cambridgeshire raceway where a teenager died in a go-karting accident has pleaded guilty to breaching health and safety rules. Suzanne Cornwell, 18, from Hardwick, died after her scarf became entangled in a kart in December 2009. Peterborough Raceway Ltd and the manager at the time, Paul Shinn, both pleaded guilty to safety breaches. They will be sentenced at Peterborough Crown Court on 4 November. Miss Cornwell's scarf became tangled in the axle of her kart on 10 December while she was taking part in an out-of-hours go-karting session. The East of England Ambulance Service said at the time the teenager had suffered "critical" neck injuries and was unconscious when paramedics arrived. She died in Addenbrooke's Hospital, in Cambridge, the following day. Following a police investigation and inquest, South Cambridgeshire District Council (SCDC) prosecuted the firm under health and safety legislation. Investigators said the company had not carried out effective health and safety risk assessments and its staff were poorly trained. There were not enough track marshals on duty and the safety briefings they provided to the public were inadequate, the council said. In addition, the premises and equipment were "generally in a poor condition". Mick Martin, SCDC's cabinet member for environmental services, described Miss Cornwell's death as a "tragic accident". He added: "There were very clear shortcomings from the company in their practices." Peterborough Raceway Ltd closed the track in Caxton after the accident and no longer operates the site. </body>

      <body>The family of an Italian man who died following an attack in Kent have spoken of their devastation that he will return home in a coffin. Joele Leotta, 20, was found seriously injured in a bedsit above a restaurant in Lower Stone Street, Maidstone, on Sunday night, and died in hospital. Mr Leotta's cousin, Andrea Augustini, said he had arrived in the UK just a few days before his death to find work. Four men from Lithuania have been charged with his murder. Mr Augustini said: "He went to find work because here there is none... and he died over there. "He will come back in a coffin - at 20 years old in a coffin - after a week." Mr Leotta's parents have travelled to Kent from Italy to formally identify his body. Aleksandras Zuravliovas, 26, of Beaumont Road, Maidstone, Tomas Gelezinis, 30, of Lower Stone Street, Maidstone, Saulius Tamoliunas, 23, of Union Street, Maidstone and Linas Zidonis, 21, of no fixed abode, appeared before Medway magistrates charged with his murder on Thursday. They were remanded in custody to appear at Maidstone Crown Court on Monday. The four Lithuanians have also been charged with grievous bodily harm in connection with another assault. </body>

      <body>A new team has been installed at a hospital trust in Norfolk labelled as high risk for providing "poor care" by health regulator Monitor. The Queen Elizabeth NHS Trust in King's Lynn has been put into special measures and a turnaround team brought in from other parts of the NHS. A new chairman and chief executive will oversee a shake-up of management. Monitor has also appointed an experienced improvement director to lead the turn around. Monitor said warnings from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) over poor patient care and a report from NHS England highlighting inadequate nurse staffing levels prompted its intervention. The trust has also been in breach of its licence over financial issues since April. David Dean, currently vice-chairman of Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London, takes over as chairman, replacing Kate Gordon who has stepped down. Manjit Obhrai, a key member of the turnaround team at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, has been appointed chief executive. David Hill, who led the turn around of neighbouring James Paget University Hospital in Great Yarmouth, has been appointed improvement director. Stephen Hay from Monitor said: "We have been monitoring the performance of this trust for some time and it is clear that the current leadership of the trust is not the right one to bring about the changes needed. "That's why we've taken this action, appointing new leadership and bringing in a team that has a wealth of experience. "Special measures will give the trust the opportunity to start delivering the standard of care patients expect." </body>

      <title>Two women's open prisons to close</title>
      <description>The Ministry of Justice announces the closure of Askham Grange and East Sutton Park women's open prisons.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24669657</url>

      <body>Two women's prisons are to close, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has announced. Askham Grange in Yorkshire and East Sutton Park in Kent are open prisons. The MoJ said it would ensure there were enough female prison places by refurbishing Eastwood Park and Foston Hall prisons and modifying buildings at Drake Hall. It comes as the MoJ announced plans for female prisoners to serve their sentences nearer to home. The MoJ says it wants female inmates to maintain family relationships, and to improve their job prospects before leaving jail. The reforms, announced by Lord McNally, the minister for female offenders, will makes women's jails so-called "resettlement prisons" intended to locate women close to home and help re-integrate them into society. As well as Askham Grange and East Sutton Park, the mother and baby unit at Holloway Prison will also be closed "due to under-occupancy", the MoJ said. The MoJ said "any demand will be met by the nearby modern, purpose-built unit at HMP Bronzefield". As of 18 October there were 101 prisoners at Askham Grange and 92 at East Sutton Park. The MoJ said the planned changes would result in a "small average reduction in distance" that women prisoners are from home. But BBC correspondent Danny Shaw said because of the latest closures, the fact there were still no jails for women in Wales and the conversion of Downview Prison to a men's prison, the resulting lack of spare room in the system made it hard to see the changes making any real difference. The planned closures will bring the number of prisons that have been closed or are planned to close to 21 since the coalition came to power in 2010. The female prison population on 30 June was 3,853, compared to 4,267 on 30 June 2010. The total prison population and detainees in immigration removal centres in England and Wales increased by 248 in the past week to 85,235. It means the number of spare places in jails in England and Wales has fallen to 811 from 841 last week. The announcements about women's prisons come after MPs accused ministers of ignoring female prisoners. The Justice Select Committee said in July that the government's probation reforms had been designed with "male offenders in mind" and treated women as "an afterthought". Lord McNally said that he wanted to end female reoffending for good. "When a female offender walks out of the prison gates, I want to make sure she never returns," he said. "Keeping female prisoners as close as possible to their homes, and importantly their children, is vital if we are to help them break the pernicious cycle of re-offending. "And providing at least a year of support in the community - alongside the means to find employment on release - will give them the best possible chance to live productive, law-abiding lives." Lord McNally also announced plans to pilot an "open unit" next year at HMP Styal, a jail in Cheshire for women and young offenders. The Ministry of Justice said the prison was chosen because of the good work it already does "helping women into jobs". One inmate, Stella, said serving her sentence at the jail allowed her to gain qualifications and be nearer to her family. "It's really important to keep the bond with the child. That's the hardest thing about being in jail - being separated from your child." The MoJ said it was considering opening a "commercial-run business" at Styal to provide training and employment opportunities for the women. It said similar ventures in Cardiff and Surrey's High Down men's prisons, which have restaurants run by prisoners and open to the public, had been a success. But Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: "Trying to improve women's imprisonment would be a waste when the best way to reduce women's offending is to invest in treatment for addictions, mental healthcare, training for work and safe housing away from domestic violence and abuse." The government says it acknowledges many women who go on to commit crime are themselves victims of domestic and sexual violence. It points to statistics suggesting 53% reported being abused as children, while 49% suffer from anxiety and depression. The MoJ says it wants to create new "personality disorder treatment services" for female prisoners by working with the NHS. Labour called on the government to avoid custodial sentences for "low-level offences". "The public want confidence that the criminal justice system is effectively punishing and reforming all those found guilty of committing crimes," said shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan. "But this government must do much more to stop women offending in the first place." He added: "With only a small number of scattered women's prisons, the concept of local resettlement is almost meaningless." </body>

      <title>East Coast rail sale gets under way</title>
      <description>Re-privatising the East Coast Main line will "revitalise" it, ministers say as they kick-start the franchising process, but Labour and unions attack the move.</description>

      <body>Returning the East Coast Main line to the private sector will "revitalise" it, ministers have said as they kick-started the franchising process. The line has been publicly run since 2009 when National Express handed back the franchise amid financial problems. Ministers say the line has since been "stabilised" but they now want to "rekindle the spirit of competition". Labour and the unions say the move is "ideological" and the line should remain in public ownership. They say the failure of two successive operators to make the line - which runs from London to Edinburgh, with connected services to Inverness and Aberdeen - commercially viable and its improved performance in recent years show it can succeed under public ownership. The government began the franchising process on Friday by releasing information about the line's financial position as well as the basic criteria for interested parties and details of the commercial risks involved. The successful bidder is due to be announced in a year's time with its franchise starting in February 2015. Among those reported to be interested in bidding is Eurostar, which runs services from London to the Continent. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said public ownership was never meant to be a permanent arrangement and returning the operation of the line to the private sector would bring more investment and innovation. "We want to see a revitalised East Coast railway, one that both rekindles the spirit of competition for customers on this great route and competes with the West Coast on speed, quality and customer service," he said. Rail minister Stephen Hammond told the BBC that the East Coast "lagged behind" other long-distance operators in terms of punctuality while customer satisfaction was only "in line" with other routes. "While they have done a good job, there is a lot more that can be done," he said, adding that the doubling of rail passengers since privatisation in the 1990s showed the benefits of the franchise process. Critics of privatisation say the East Coast line has returned £800m to the taxpayer under public ownership. But Mr Hammond said this was not a fair comparison as Network Rail had reduced charges for using the track substantially since National Express relinquished the franchise. The government says it is already planning "significant" investment in the line over the next six years, including new rolling stock, upgrades to the track around Peterborough and the rebuilding of Doncaster station. But it wants a private sector operator to "transform the customer experience", develop "innovative timetables" and identify further opportunities for improving stations along the 353-mile route. But Labour said the privatisation process - which was expected to be delayed until after the next election - was being driven by ideological reasons rather than the interests of passengers. The opposition say the government has "learnt nothing" from the debacle over the West Coast Main Line franchising process last year, which had to be abandoned after mistakes by civil servants led to flawed calculations. Speaking to the Financial Times, shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said Labour's review of rail policy next year would consider the case for re-nationalisation among other options. "We want a model that is going to work. What is interesting is that we have foreign state-owned railways running our services and investing money back into their own networks. "If it works as a model for them, why can't it work as a model for the UK?" The RMT union has pledged to fight the re-privatisation, saying the government is playing down the success of the line under public ownership in order to "bulldoze" the sale through. Earlier this month it claimed a leaked version of the draft sale brochure redacted sections highlighting the good punctuality and performance of the service under public ownership. "It is simply outrageous that the government are firing the starting gun on the re-privatisation of the East Coast when every objective analysis shows that this is a successful and reliable service," RMT boss Bob Crow said. And the TUC said the line needed an operator which would put passengers not shareholders first. "The government doesn't have one good argument for re-privatising the line and is yet again being blinded by outdated market dogma," said general secretary Frances O'Grady. "As with the Royal Mail, they are putting ideology before evidence in the desire to sell off yet another important state asset." </body>

      <body>Everton FC has paid tribute to a 10-year-old boy hit and killed by a bus three days after meeting his heroes. James Greenop was knocked down by a bus near the Matchworks on Speke Road, Liverpool, on Tuesday. The club sent a shirt for his "final journey", flowers and a signed letter from manager Roberto Martinez. James's family has set up an online fund-raising page in his memory to collect donations for Wirral Autistic Society. The "devoted" Everton fan had a kick-around on the pitch at half-time at Goodison Park during the team's 2-1 victory over Hull City. Before the match, James also had a tour of the stadium with Everton In The Community and met a number of players who signed his kit. "He told us it had been 'the best day of my life'," said his parents Helen and Russell. They added: "We would like to thank Everton Football Club for sending flowers, a signed letter of condolence from their manager, and a kit for James to wear for his final journey. "They have been really supportive." His parents have set up a Just Giving page for a cause special to the "family's heart". </body>

      <body>The Respect party no longer has any councillors in Bradford after they all resigned, accusing George Galloway of defamation and lack of transparency. The five councillors, elected in a surge of local support for Respect last year, temporarily resigned in August but have now left the party altogether. Two were suspended over criticism of Mr Galloway's plans to stand for London mayor, and he questioned their loyalty. Respect said the councillors' conduct had been "unacceptable". The five councillors are Alyas Karmani, Ruqaya Collector, Faisal Khan, Ishtiaq Ahmed and Mohammed Shabbir. Speaking to The Guardian in August, they criticised Mr Galloway, saying he should step down as an MP if he wanted to fight in the 2016 London mayoral election. In response to the article, Mr Galloway accused the councillors of "destabilising the party" and "conniving with the Khans", in reference to his former aide Aisha Ali Khan and her police officer husband Det Insp Afiz Khan who have been charged with misconduct offences. Mr Ahmed and Mr Shabbir were suspended by national party managers the same day. In a statement issued on Friday the councillors said they had been in discussions with senior party officials over the past two months to address their concerns about the "unwarranted" suspensions, "defamatory" statements made about them and a "failure to develop transparent operations structures and procedures to enable the party to work effectively in Bradford". They said: "Regrettably, these discussions have failed to find common ground as senior Respect officials have shown a disregard to address our legitimate grievances and we have been unable to resolve our issues of difference. "After much deliberation this has left our group no choice but to fully resign from the Respect party with immediate effect." The councillors said they would continue as independents for the remainder of their terms. Respect said talks between party officials and the councillors had "foundered on the unacceptable conduct of the councillors", who it accused of regularly speaking out against the party. It said Mr Ahmed and Mr Shabir were expelled by the party on Thursday, the day the councillors say they informed officials of their resignation. A Respect statement said the councillors' visibility and impact in the council chamber "has been virtually non-existent". "If they had a shred of principle they would now resign their council seats and stand again in their new colours. Or will they instead continue to draw thousands of pounds of public money until they are removed by the voters?" </body>

      <body>A new colony of water voles has been captured on film using hidden cameras at a canal lock in Wiltshire. Ecologists from the Canal and River Trust spotted signs of the creatures during conservation works at the Caen Hill lock flight near Devizes. Laura Plenty, from the trust, said: "We decided it was a fantastic place to test our heat and motion sensitive camera to catch them in the act." The nationally-protected species is one of the UK's fastest declining mammals. Ms Plenty said the trust had been working to create the right habitat for the creatures in an attempt to reverse the decline in the water vole population. She said they knew there were some colonies on the canal near Devizes but had not been aware of this particular colony until the recent visit to Caen Hill Lock. She said they put the camera in place after "spotting a water vole latrine which is basically a big pile of droppings". "I couldn't believe it when we captured our first footage of the water vole," Ms Plenty said. "It clearly wasn't camera shy, as we managed to get further footage, with the vole even investigating the camera and knocking it over which happily lead to some fantastic shots of water voles hauling themselves out of the water. "Viewing the footage of the vole proves that this hard work has been worthwhile. "The fact that there's a new colony of voles living on the canal is the best reward we could ask for." Water voles like to live along canals and riverbanks so they can burrow to create complicated systems of underground tunnels and nesting chambers. A survey released by the Environment Agency and wildlife trusts in September, suggested that water voles had decreased by a fifth in the UK since 2011. Reasons for the declining population include habitat loss, predation by American mink and changeable weather. </body>

      <body>Supermarket chain Sainsbury's has apologised after a worker told a new mother she "shouldn't be out of the house with a baby this young". Sabina Latto said she was approached by the female employee in a store in Hedge End, Hampshire, with questions about her six-week-old son, Myles. But the conversation turned and she was later asked: "Where's the father?" She complained while in the store and the worker apologised. Sainsbury's said it was investigating. Mrs Latto said it was one of the few times she had taken Myles out of the house since he was born. "I was approached by a member of staff, and when you have a new baby lots of people approach you and usually it's very kind things like 'oh isn't he gorgeous', and initially that's how the conversation started," she told BBC News. "Unfortunately it took a very sudden turn when she decided to tell me that, basically, I shouldn't be out of the house with a baby this young. "She asked me what I was thinking 'bringing my son to a place like this'. "It left me completely shocked, I was almost speechless." The new mother said other shoppers stepped in to defend her but the remarks continued during the incident on Wednesday. "Then she went on to ask me where my son's father was," Mrs Latto added. "[It] made it seem like I wasn't looking after him properly and that I was neglecting him when all I was doing was having a look round the shops." She made a complaint and was taken for a chat in the store's cafe where the employee later made an apology. In a statement, Sainsbury's said: "We are deeply concerned by this incident and apologise unreservedly to Mrs Latto for the distress this has caused her. "We are investigating what happened and the store manager would like to meet Mrs Latto to apologise in person." </body>

      <body>England and Australia will kick off the 14th World Cup at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday in the first game of a double-header in Cardiff. The Kangaroos suffered a shock defeat by New Zealand in 2008, and the Kiwis are one of 14 teams in the competition, alongside debutants Italy and the USA. There will be 28 matches in England, Wales, Ireland and France with the final at Old Trafford on 30 November. Wales take on Italy in Saturday's second game in Cardiff. Co-hosts Wales are in Group C, while Italy are in Group D, with the two groups of weaker nations playing each other to produce two quarter-finalists - a format designed to ensure every team in the competition has a chance of scoring tries and winning a game. Three teams will also advance into the quarter-finals from each of groups A and B, containing the stronger nations. The Azzurri - at 13th the second-lowest ranked team in the World Cup - stunned Steve McNamara's England men in a warm-up match, winning 15-14 in Salford. But England will be boosted knowing they possess a pack containing the Burgess trio of Sam, George and Thomas from NRL side South Sydney Rabbitohs, as well as Grand Final winner Sam Tomkins at full-back. St Helens hooker James Roby insists the side are ready for the clash against eight-time champions Australia. "We know we need to perform and we know we need to improve a hell of a lot," said Roby. "They've been a similar team for the last few years. We've played against them a number of times so we know what to expect. "The NRL lads are playing against them week in, week out so they'll have a few things that we might not know and that can only help us." Overwhelming favourites Australia, boast a team consisting of Johnathan Thurston, Cooper Cronk, Cameron Smith and Billy Slater who all play together for Queensland in the State of Origin. Australia coach Tim Sheens is expecting an England backlash following the defeat by Italy. "I know Steve will be disappointed but, to me, a side that's embarrassed is a dangerous side," said Sheens. "I saw what I wanted to see, but, as far as the result is concerned, that's for England to worry about, not me. My concern is to make sure that we're on song for our first game." New Zealand, in Group B with Papua New Guinea, France and Samoa, will be looking to emulate the success of five years ago when they picked up the trophy for the first time. And they will buoyed by the late inclusion of dual-code international Sonny Bill Williams who won the NRL title with Sydney Roosters. Williams is confident he can cope with the pressure of bidding to become the first player to win World Cups in both rugby league and rugby union. "From the start of this season, there was a lot of pressure. I had everything to lose and the pressure was firmly on me," he said. "I guess I kind of thrive on that. It gets the best out of me. I seem to be able to push that to one side and focus on all the little things." Wales are making their third appearance in the tournament and coach Iestyn Harris expects his side to reach the quarter-finals. "The crucial thing for us is to get out of the group," he said. "We've got three difficult opponents. When you get through your group, then it's knockout football and that's where you want to be." Scotland coach Steve McCormack hopes skipper Danny Brough of Huddersfield Giants can lead his side by example, with the Bravehearts set to face Tonga and Italy. "You don't get the Man of Steel by not being a good player," said McCormack. "We're not a team of superstars, but we're a team of really good players that work very hard together. Danny is at the head of that. He works exceptionally hard." Ireland have been handed a tough group alongside England, Australia and Fiji, and coach Mark Aston said: "We haven't had the luxury of going to South Africa for a training camp but we're coming together. "It's a case of blending individuals into a collective and the group are getting close." </body>

      <body>Kell Brook wants to prove he is ready for a world title shot by doing a "demolition job" on Vyacheslav Senchenko in Sheffield on Saturday. Brook, 27, is set to fight for the IBF welterweight crown if he beats Ukrainian Senchenko, who finished Ricky Hatton's career last November.  "I need to make a statement," said Brook, who is unbeaten in 30 fights. Also on a packed card at the Motorpoint Arena is Olympic champion Anthony Joshua's second paid fight. Heavyweight prospect Joshua, who kicked off his pro career with a first-round knockout of Italian Emanuele Leo three weeks ago, faces fellow Briton Paul Butlin. Blackpool's Brian Rose, 28, faces Argentine Javier Maciel in a final eliminator for the WBO light-middleweight title. Rising Liverpool star Callum Smith meets Ruben Acosta, another Argentine, for the fringe WBC super-middleweight international title. And another former Olympian, bantamweight Khal Yafai, boxes for the first time since injuring his biceps in his last outing in March, against Spaniard Abigail Medina. Brook's opponent Senchencko, 36, is a former world champion and has been beaten once in 35 pro encounters, by American stalwart Paulie Malignaggi in April of last year. But he bounced back with a ninth-round knockout of Hatton, sending the Manchester hero into retirement for a second time. Brook should have challenged for Devon Alexander's IBF belt before now but injuries to both fighters scuppered the match on three occasions. But Brook took his frustration out on Carson Jones in July, stopping the American in a rematch in the eighth round.  If Brook comes through his fight against Senchenko he will fight either Alexander or Shawn Porter, who meet in Texas next month. "The fans remember what he did to Ricky and know this is a real fight. But it's a different story going in with me," added Brook. </body>

      <body>England's Women were beaten in a Super Over eliminator by West Indies in the final group match of the triangular Twenty20 series in the Caribbean. The two teams had already qualified for Saturday's final after securing two victories to New Zealand's one. But in a dead rubber, West Indies made 118-7 after opting to bat, with England reaching exactly the same total. After England made 6-1 in the one extra over, West Indies claimed victory with two fours from Deandra Dottin. The Super Over was the first of the tournament in Bridgetown and saw West Indies top the table on 12 points after their third victory in four games. Skipper Stafanie Taylor top-scored for her side in the main contest with 40 from 43 balls, having come to the crease midway through the fifth over, while Dottin added a four and two sixes in 26 from only 12 balls. England's top six all reached double figures, Lydia Greenway striking four fours in her 36. She was run out in the 17th over with 18 runs required from 16 balls, before Taylor removed acting England captain Jenny Gunn and Natalie Sciver in consecutive balls to restrict the tourists and take the game into the extra over. England then lost Danielle Wyatt, who was run out second ball, as they set the West Indies a target of seven for victory. The hosts needed only one legitimate delivery to take the win as Gunn, who took 5-18 in the previous match against New Zealand, conceded a no-ball and two boundaries. </body>

      <title>Does football need early kick-offs?</title>
      <description>Do early kick-offs really help prevent football violence?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-24606069</url>

      <body>This weekend Sunderland play Newcastle United for the first time since more than 100 fans were arrested after trouble following a game last season. Like that fixture, Sunday's match will kick off earlier than many fans would like, but do early starts still prevent violence? April's Tyne-Wear derby at St James' Park will be remembered for events both on and off the pitch. Sunderland won on Tyneside for the first time in almost 13 years and the aftermath of the game is still making its way through the courts. Several Newcastle fans received prison sentences, including one man who was jailed for a year after he admitted punching a police horse, and two 12-year-old boys are now among the youngest in the country to have football banning orders. It came as some surprise to fans, then, when Sunday's match between the fierce rivals was originally scheduled for 16:00 GMT by Sky Sports, but no one connected to either club was shocked when the kick-off was brought forward to 13:30 for safety reasons. Early kick-offs are unpopular with fans attending games and some have questioned whether they still serve their purpose of reducing drinking time. Kevin Miles from the Football Supporters' Federation said he was "yet to be convinced" the measure was still relevant. "The fact is that once you give agencies like the police additional powers of this kind, they'll be very reluctant to relinquish them," he said. "From what I can see there appears to be little correlation between the time a game starts and the numbers of arrests made, especially at derby games. "The last Tyne-Wear derby was an early kick-off, yet the number of arrests was among the highest ever. Added to that was the fact the less than 10% of those arrested had actually attended the game." Home Office statistics released this month revealed more Newcastle fans had been arrested than any other club during the 2012-13 season, with the figure vastly inflated by the trouble following Sunderland's 3-0 win on Tyneside in April. The figures showed football arrests had risen by 4% but the number of fans held for alcohol-related issues was down from 800 to 549 year-on-year. Geoff Pearson from Liverpool University has researched the impact of alcohol restrictions on football crowds and found fans observed in a study would go to "extraordinary lengths" to overcome "practical and legal measures". He said early kick-offs did reduce the alcohol consumed, although perhaps not as much as police forces would like. "Fans will start earlier, but if you have a 17:30 kick-off, fans belonging to that drinking sub-culture are going to drink for about five hours before the game, whereas if you had a midday kick-off, they're not going to be drinking for as long. "They might start at 10:00 maybe, but they're not going to be consuming the same amount. "What does happen is that over the course of the day an early kick-off means there's going to be more drinking time in total." Mr Pearson said early kick-offs could lead to volatile situations for "same city derbies" where fans would mix long after the game Fans on either side of the Wear-Tyne divide point to relaxed licensing laws as an example of why the measure may now have less of an impact than in the past. Gary Stephens, a former chairman of Sunderland's fan liaison group, believes early kick-offs should be scrapped. "They absolutely do not work", he said. "As far as drinking goes, you can't stop it. Pubs can open whenever they want, now that we've got 24 hour drinking. But even if they didn't, people can simply go to the supermarket, get tanked up and still cause trouble." Of its 384 licensed premises, Sunderland Council said 67 were able to serve alcohol before 11:00 BST. It has rejected one temporary application to serve from 08:00 BST on Sunday after objections from police. Northumbria Police's operations commander for Sunday's game Ch Supt Steve Neill said "public safety and the welfare of fans" was the "absolute priority". "We sometimes seek earlier kick-off times for the derby to reduce the length of time people have to consume alcohol and to help prevent the likelihood of crime and disorder," he said. Mark Jensen, editor of Newcastle fanzine The Mag, said he had not found any football fan that had "anything to say" for early kick-offs. "It's crazy in this day and age that a crowd of around 50,000 can be inconvenienced just because of the risk a small minority might cause trouble. "When there's so much money in football and the police have CCTV and all their other resources it does seem mad that you can't have a match after a certain time. "Police will always play the public order card but after the match at St James' Park in April that seems to have been blown out of the water." Ch Supt Neill said the police priority was for "supporters to be able to enjoy the game". He will join fans of both clubs in hoping Sunday's talking points are generated purely on the field. </body>

      <title>Could kazoos be banned in Camden?</title>
      <description>Why celebrities played kazoos in rock 'n' roll Camden</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-24653453</url>
      <date>1382640044</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70697000/jpg/_70697909_70695770.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Camden Town is famed for its musical connections - so why is the council trying to ban kazoos? If you meander through the north London town on any given day your ears are assaulted by a cacophony of sounds - loud music, market traders, sirens and gig goers spilling out on to the streets. Along with famous venues such as the Roundhouse and the Electric Ballroom, the "most rock 'n' roll borough in London" also offers music in the form of buskers. And on Thursday afternoon, the main buskers drawing the crowds were comedians Mark Thomas and Bill Bailey along with musician Billy Bragg. They were playing Star Wars' Death March on kazoos, a wind instrument they claim Camden council wants to ban. At the moment anyone can rock up and play whatever they like, whenever they like. However, the council wants to restrict performances to between 10:00 and 21:00. Under the proposals, anyone who wants to play a wind instrument - apart from the flute and the recorder - would need a special licence, as would all percussion instruments. Any form of amplification would be banned. "It's a particularly draconian law," said Mark Thomas. "The thing about culture and where we live is that London is a vibrant, exciting and lively place and we want it to stay like that." He added: "It smacks of social cleansing and I think Camden is a unique and wonderful borough and actually it needs to keep its uniqueness rather than airbrush over it and to clean it out." Thomas said the council did not need to introduce a new law, but should instead set up a forum whereby the entertainers, business owners and residents could get together and work out any problems. "I totally accept there'll be occasions when it's too loud; totally accept there'll be occasions when it's inappropriate, but you just get a method of good practice. "If you want to solve the problem, the way to do it isn't to be very draconian and use a sledgehammer to crack a nut." Busker Jonny Walker, who has spearheaded the campaign, said although the council had accused him of being alarmist, it was using the threat of coercion to manage what was a "very small problem". He said in the last year, there were 104 complaints - 15 from the same person - and that there were 52 complainants in total. The musician added that under the terms of the licence, instruments could be confiscated and performers could be fined £1,000. For Bragg, his main concern is that the cultural heritage of the area could change. Camden's links with rock 'n' roll go back to the mid-'60s, after a disused railway yard was turned into a counter-culture landmark called the Roundhouse. Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix played in its cavernous interior. Amy Winehouse praised the area in her Grammy Awards acceptance speech; Bob Marley lived there in 1972 and Prince had a boutique shop there in the mid 1990s. "Camden is the most rock 'n' roll borough in London. "Wouldn't it be sad if Camden was as dull and dead as some other backwater place? It's vibrant, it's alive. "My friend's kids, when they come to play in London they want to play in Camden, they don't want to play in Barking or Sutton," said Bragg. He added: "If the people in Camden who are living this cutting edge life can't put up with a few people standing in a street singing "Take you by the hand and let me take you around the streets of Camden" then it's musical incorrectness gone mad." The council said it had no plans to ban busking, but it had to listen to the concerns of residents who have complained. Cabinet member for community safety Abdul Hai said: "We believe that all forms of street entertainment are an important part of the musical and cultural heritage of the borough. "However, in recent months we have received an escalating number of complaints from local residents regarding disruptive busking activity, particularly where amplification is used in residential areas. "We cannot allow the lives of people who live and work in Camden to be disrupted by noise nuisance. "However, we are not trying to drive away street entertainers we are instead looking to attract them and add value to the performances that they give." </body>

      <title>Bomber County crashes to be collated</title>
      <description>Researchers collate WWII accidents in Bomber County</description>

      <body>Researchers aim to create a definitive record of all known World War II aircraft accidents that happened in the area known as Bomber County. Lincolnshire became known as Bomber County because it had more than 100 airfields and airstrips in the war. Bomber County Aviation Resource knows of about 2,000 crashes and accidents there, but expects to collate information on as many as 4,000. Some pilots crashed and died before they had finished their training. The group hopes to estimate accurately, for the first time, how many people died because as a result of aircraft accidents. Graham Platt, a co-founder of the group, said: "It was wartime, there was an awful lot of dying going on, and that kind of thing was heavily censored at the time. "The number of aircraft that crashed and people that died was sensitive." Lincolnshire's high concentration of airfields meant the skies were often crowded. Some of the accidents and crashes involved German aircraft that had flown over Britain but others involved British and US aircraft. Civilians were also killed when aircraft flew into people and homes. "When they tried to land the brakes would fail and the aircraft would carry on beyond the runway," said Mr Platt. "One overran a field and killed a man cycling along." Not all of the accidents happened in the sky - some aircraft crashed while taxiing on the ground. Mr Platt said: "This is an area of the county's history that is in real danger of slipping into obscurity. "It's a daunting prospect, but we owe it to those involved in these accidents and their families to ensure that this information is recorded and preserved for future generations to be able to access and understand." The group has been awarded an £11,400 Heritage Lottery Fund grant to do the research. The volunteer researchers aim to complete the work by summer 2015, to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. The results will be collated in a book, which will be presented to libraries, museums, RAF stations in the county and national museums of the air forces involved in the accidents. A DVD will be produced and given to schools in Lincolnshire. The main research material for accidents involving British planes will be aircraft accident record cards, stored on microfilm. Copies of these microfilms will be given to Lincolnshire County Archives at the end of the project. </body>

      <body>The FBI has issued wanted posters for a man they say is behind an eBay car scam that has netted $3m (£1.8m). Authorities in the US also want to track down six other fugitives in relation to the charges. The gang were described as "masters of illusion" who convinced people to pay for cars that did not exist. "They thought their distance would insulate them from law enforcement scrutiny. They were wrong," said US attorney Loretta Lynch. The FBI put out a wanted poster for 33-year-old Romanian Nicolae Popescu, charging him with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. "They siphoned funds from victims to fuel their greedy desires and created false identities, fake websites and counterfeit certificates of title in order to make the scheme more convincing," said FBI Assistant Director, George Venizelos. "Popescu and his co-conspirators were masters of illusion, but they can't escape their ultimate reality. "With the help of our law enforcement partners at home and abroad, we will bring them to justice." In a recorded conversation, the FBI said Mr Popescu boasted that he was "beyond the reach" of US authorities. As well as eBay, the gang is said to have used Cars.com, AutoTrader.com, and CycleTrader.com to sell the non-existent cars, usually priced between $10,000 (£6,150) and $40,000 (£24,700). "After the 'sellers' reached an agreement with the victim buyers, they would often email them invoices purporting to be from Amazon Payments, PayPal, or other online payment services, with instructions to transfer the money to the US bank accounts used by the defendants," an FBI statement explained. Romania has gained increasing notoriety as a hub for cybercrime. A report from technology magazine Wired detailed a village dubbed "Hackerville" by locals - where cybercriminals are said to learn their craft at an early age. </body>

      <title>Twitter float could raise $1.4bn</title>
      <description>Twitter says it will sell 70 million shares priced between $17 (£10.50) and $20, valuing the microblogging site at as much as $11bn.</description>

      <body>Twitter has unveiled the price range for its shares when the company lists on the stock exchange. In a filing on Thursday, Twitter said it planned to sell 70 million shares priced between $17 and $20 (£10 - £12) to raise up to $1.4bn (£865m). The offering represents 13% of Twitter and values it at as much as $11bn. Analysts said the valuation, which was less than forecast, indicated the firm wanted to avoid the dip in prices that followed Facebook's listing. "They're trying to price this for a very strong IPO, ideally creating the conditions for a solid after-market," said Brian Wieser of the Pivotal Research Group. Facebook's shares were priced initially at $38 per share. The stock soared within hours of its debut to a high of $45 but later slumped. Some analysts had blamed over pricing of the shares as a reason behind the fall. However, Facebook shares have since recouped most of their losses and are now trading above the listing price. Twitter's share sale on the New York Stock Exchange will make it the biggest internet company to go public after Facebook. The microblogging site has seen steady growth since its launch seven years ago. According to its IPO documents, it now has 218 million monthly users and 500 million tweets are sent a day. However, all those users and tweets have not yet resulted in a profit. Twitter made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m. Some analysts said that while the lower-than-expected pricing may help its share prices in the days after the listing, in the long run investors would still need to see the firm make profits. "The fact that the valuation is lower than expectations, I think was smart by the underwriters. I think it will help the pop," said Michael Yoshikami of Destinational Wealth Management. "But in the end, even for $11bn, the question is can they come up with earnings to substantiate that number? And it's unclear that they're going to be able to do that." Almost 85% of Twitter's revenue currently comes from advertising on its site. There are three main ways for a company or an individual to advertise on Twitter: by promoting a tweet that will appear in people's timelines, promoting a whole account, or promoting a trend. Twitter tends to charge its advertisers according to the amount of interaction their content generates. Some analysts say the company has showing strong signs of growth, with revenue rising from just $28m in 2010 to $317m by the end of 2012. One research firm, eMarketer, has even estimated that Twitter's revenues from advertising sales will increase by more than 100% by the end of this year. </body>

      <title>MEPs vote to suspend US data sharing</title>
      <description>A non-binding vote in the EU represents growing unease about the amount of data Europe has shared with the US.</description>

      <body>The European Parliament has voted to suspend the sharing of financial data with the US, following allegations that citizens' data was spied on. The allegation forms part of leaked documents from whistleblower Edward Snowden. The vote is non-binding but illustrates MEPs' growing unease over how much data was shared with the US. It comes a day after it was alleged that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone calls were monitored. The European Parliament voted to suspend its Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP) agreement with the US, in response to the alleged tapping of EU citizens' bank data held by the Belgian company SWIFT. The agreement granted the US authorities access to bank data for terror-related investigations but leaked documents made public by whistleblower Edward Snowden allege that the global bank transfer network was the target of wider US surveillance. MEPs also want to launch a full inquiry into the alleged spying. The row over exactly how much snooping was done on European citizens appears to be escalating. Germany has summoned the US ambassador in Berlin over the claims that the US monitored Mrs Merkel's mobile phone calls. Other leaders are also likely to want further clarification from Washington over the activities of its National Security Agency (NSA) in Europe. Meanwhile student group, europe v facebook, is launching a fresh attack on how deeply the social network was involved in the US spying programme. It has won the right for a review of why the Irish data protection commissioner is not investigating the amount of European data shared with the US. Commissioner Billy Hawkes has previously claimed that there "is nothing to investigate" over Facebook's role in the PRISM programme. Max Schrem, who heads the group, remains unconvinced. "When it comes to the fundamental rights of millions of users and the biggest surveillance scandal in years, he will have to take responsibility and do something about it," he said. </body>

      <title>3D printer 'gun parts' found in raid</title>
      <description>A 3D printer and suspected "homemade" gun components seized during police raids in Manchester are being examined.</description>

      <body>A 3D printer and suspected "homemade" gun components seized during police raids in Manchester are being examined. Detectives initially said the parts were a "plastic magazine and trigger" which could make a "viable" gun. But the man held on suspicion of making gunpowder has told the BBC they are actually sections of a 3D printer. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) now say they "cannot categorically say" whether they had recovered the component parts for a gun. A force spokesman said if the tests showed the parts could make a functioning weapon it would be the "first ever seizure of this kind in the UK". Det Insp Chris Mossop, of GMP, said: "If what we have seized is proven to be viable components capable of constructing a genuine firearm, then it demonstrates that organised crime groups are acquiring technology that can be bought on the high street to produce the next generation of weapons. "In theory, the technology essentially allows offenders to produce their own guns in the privacy of their own home, which they can then supply to the criminal gangs who are causing such misery in our communities. "Because they are also plastic and can avoid X-ray detection, it makes them easy to conceal and smuggle." He added: "If what we have seized today can, as we suspect, be used to make a genuine firearm then today will be an important milestone in the fight against this next generation of homemade weapons." The BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said the discovery was "almost inevitable" because of the relatively few firearms in circulation. "The worst-case-scenario would be a cheap and 100% reliable device that could be made overnight and then destroyed after just one use, disposing of crucial evidence to pin to a suspect," he added. The raid was part of GMP's Operation Challenger, which aims to "dismantle" organised criminal gangs. Counterfeit goods worth £2m, more than £330,000 of drugs and £25,000 cash, have been seized in a crackdown. 3D printing technology works by building up layer upon layer of material - typically plastic - to create complex solid objects. Desktop 3D printers can be bought on the high street for less than £1,000, but prices can be as high as £10,000. The world's first gun made with 3D printer technology was successfully fired in the US in May. The group that created the firearm, Defense Distributed, said it planned to make the blueprints available online. Defense Distributed is headed by Cody Wilson, a 25-year-old law student at the University of Texas, who defended making the design available by saying: "I'm seeing a world where technology says you can pretty much be able to have whatever you want. "It's not up to the political players anymore." At the time, Europe's law enforcement agency Europol said it feared criminals would follow suit as the technology became cheaper and more user friendly. </body>

      <body>Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, saw its losses narrow in the third quarter as its sales grew more than expected. It reported a net loss of $41m (£25m) for the July-September period. That is down from $274m a year earlier. The firm said that its sales surged 24% from a year ago to $17.1bn. The firm forecast its sales would grow further in the current quarter. That saw its shares rise by as much as 9.6% in after-hours trading in New York. RJ Jottovy, an analyst with Morningstar, said that "it looks like the revenue momentum will continue into the fourth quarter" despite the macro business environment being tough. Amazon said it expects fourth-quarter sales of $23.5bn to $26.5bn. Analysts had forecast revenue of $25.9bn. This is the third quarter in a row that Amazon has posted a net loss. However, the firm has been taking steps to try to turn around its fortunes. This includes expanding its Kindle line of e-readers and tablets and boosting its delivery network and cloud-computing services. The company has also been building more warehouses to reduce shipping costs and is adding robots to increase its efficiency in delivering orders. Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, said in a statement that ''it's been a busy few months" for the company. At the same time some of the services being offered by the firm have also helped to attract consumers. Mr Bezos added that one Amazon service called Prime had signed up "millions" of new members. The service offers free two-day shipping for eligible purchases. Members also get access to Amazon Instant Video and have the ability to borrow books from other Kindle owners. </body>

      <body>Samsung Electronics has reported a 26% jump in profit in the third quarter driven by strong smartphone sales and a recovery in its memory chip business. It made a net profit of 8.24 trillion won ($7.6bn; £4.7bn) in the July-to-September quarter, up from 6.56tn won during the same period a year earlier. Operating profit rose to a record 10.2 trillion won during the quarter. The firm said sales of smartphones, a key driver of its growth, are expected to rise further in coming months. It said that sales "will gain momentum due to year-end promotions over the holiday season and an improved line-up of mass-market smartphones". Samsung has posted record operating profit in six of the past seven quarters, mostly due to the growth of its smartphone division. The firm has enjoyed success in both the top-end as well as lower end of the smartphone market, giving it an edge over rivals such as Apple which makes only top-end phones. Its growth in the sector has seen it become the world's biggest smartphone maker. However, there have been concerns over whether Samsung can continue to grow at such a strong pace, not least because of increased competition and saturation of some key markets. "Samsung has done well, having rapidly caught up with Apple in the smartphone market. But I'm concerned whether Samsung would be able to do better," said Kim Sung-soo, a fund manager at LS Asset Management. "Like Nokia, Samsung may hit a limit in increasing market share. Apple is also fighting back, signalling an uphill battle for Samsung." Analysts said that the company needed to come up with more innovative products to help sustain its growth rate. For its part, Samsung has been taking steps in that direction. Earlier this month, it launched a smartphone with a curved display screen, beating its rival LG by at least a few months to offer a handset featuring flexible-screen tech. In September, it unveiled a smartwatch with a colour screen that can show alerts, be used for voice calls and run apps. Again, it edged firms such as Microsoft, Apple and Google to unveil such a device. Samsung's latest earnings were also boosted by its semiconductor business, which saw profit more than double to 2.1tn won, the highest in three years. Revenues in the division rose 12% over the previous quarter to 9.74tn won. The firm saw its bottom line buoyed by stronger chip prices after a fire at a plant owned by rival SK Hynix caused tightened supply in the market. Samsung supplies chips to other smartphone-makers, including its biggest competitor Apple, and expects demand to pick up as the year draws to a close. However, its consumer electronics division, which includes TV manufacturing, saw a decline in profit due to a drop in demand in China and Europe. But Samsung said that it expects the unit to bounce back in the current quarter, not least due to holiday season shopping during the end of the year. </body>

      <body>Microsoft reported better than expected earnings of $5.2bn (£3.2bn). Profits at the technology giant were up 17% from the same period last year. "Our devices and services transformation is progressing," said boss Steve Ballmer in a statement. He added that Microsoft is launching a "wide range" of new products in the coming quarter. The report shed no light on who is to replace Mr Ballmer, who announced plans to retire within the next year. The company has released several new products this quarter, including an update to Windows 8, and recently bought the mobile phone unit of struggling Finnish giant Nokia. Shares rose 6% in after hours trading on the strong results. For the first time, Microsoft also announced sales of its tablet computer, Surface. It said revenues from Surface "grew to $400 million with sequential growth in revenue and units sold over the prior quarter". Last quarter, the company was forced to take an embarrassing write down of $900m after sluggish sales. The computer, well-liked by reviewers, marked Microsoft's first foray into hardware manufacturing. However consumers, many of whom expressed displeasure at Microsoft's update to its popular operating system Windows, did not bite. The company still did not provide sales figures of the device. Investors hoping for any information about who will replace Mr Ballmer in the new year were disappointed. Earlier today, on a conference call to discuss earnings, Ford boss Alan Mullaly declined to comment on rumours that he was being considered for the top job. Other contenders include Stephen Elop, the former head of Nokia, who resigned as boss after Microsoft announced it would purchase the Nokia's mobile phone unit for 5.4bn euros ($7.2bn; £4.6bn) in September. Mr Elop is now head of Devices and Services at Nokia, although he is expected to transfer to Microsoft - where he was once a top manager - once the deal is completed. Mr Ballmer has been at the helm of Microsoft since 2000, and has been at the company since 1980. </body>

      <title>Ofcom reveals state of UK broadband</title>
      <description>Ofcom's annual report reveals that while some UK roads are 3G notspots, superfast broadband is now available for the majority of homes.</description>

      <body>While superfast broadband is now available to almost three quarters of UK homes, getting a connection on Britain's roads is more tricky, according to a report from Ofcom. Its annual infrastructure report looked at mobile coverage on roads for the first time. While motorways have good 3G coverage, just 35% of the UK's A and B roads are served by all four mobile networks. The report found that 9% of roads have no 3G coverage at all. The latest trends in mobile and broadband outlined by the report are designed to give a snapshot of the UK's communications market. Despite wide availability of broadband networks in the UK's towns and cities, only 4.8 million customers are taking advantage of superfast speeds, defined by the watchdog as 30Mbps (megabits per second) or above. That equates to 22% of connections, up from 10% last year. There are several reasons why consumers may be reluctant to upgrade, thinks Andrew Ferguson from broadband news site ThinkBroadband. "The usual factors we encounter from consumers are resistance to any increase in price, and the £10 to £20 premium for faster services can deter many, particularly if paying under £10 for their broadband service now," he said. "There are also a good number who after not getting speeds close to the advertised speeds previously are wary of upgrading for little or no benefit," he added. The appetite for data is huge though - Britons use 650 million gigabytes in an average month, equivalent to more than one billion copies of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, according to the report. Ofcom believes that there are two main factors contributing to this deluge of data - the fact that many households have lots of devices wanting to connect to the internet and the need for high-quality on-demand TV services. Outside the home, people are also demanding more connectivity. According to the report the number of public wi-fi hotspots in the UK has doubled from 16,000 to 34,000 over the last year. The amount of data being sent or received from these hotspots has almost trebled, to almost 2 million gigabytes a month. Meanwhile 4G services continue to be rolled out by the UK's mobile operators. As well as looking at coverage on the UK's roads, Ofcom is also looking at 3G services on railways although the results will not be released until next year. "We know consumers increasingly expect superfast speeds, but it is also important to make sure people can connect over a very wide area. That is why we are doing everything we can to support moves to improve coverage in difficult areas such as roads and train lines," said Ed Richards, Ofcom's chief executive. </body>

      <title>Coated silicon to boost battery life</title>
      <description>Phone batteries that recharge in minutes and last for weeks could result from work on silicon super-capacitors.</description>

      <body>Phone batteries that recharge in minutes and last for weeks could result from work on silicon super-capacitors. Created by American scientists, the components exploit properties of carefully engineered silicon slices to hold and quickly deliver a charge. Renewable energy sources could also benefit from the work on the cheaper super-capacitors. The silicon components should be easy to add to existing chip-production systems, said the researchers. Super-capacitors built from carbon are already used as energy storage systems in electric vehicles and in wind turbines to ensure blades turn smoothly, but their bulk and cost have limited them to these niche applications. Scientists in the engineering department at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee tested different materials to see if they could be used to reduce the cost and size of these super-capacitors. Silicon became a good candidate when the Vanderbilt team found a way to apply a coat of graphene that was only a few nanometres thick. This coating was needed to stop the silicon reacting with the chemicals that provide the ions used to store an electrical charge. The team, headed by engineering professor Cary Pint, used porous silicon in their research because the method of etching billions of tiny pits on to the material is well established. All those nano-scale features give the material a huge surface area relative to its size and help it store a significant electrical charge. Writing in a paper in the journal Nature, the scientists explained how the coating bestowed on the silicon properties similar to those seen in commercial super-capacitors. It allows them to dispense their stored power quickly and last much longer than current re-chargeable batteries. The team is now looking into ways to integrate the coated silicon into existing manufacturing processes so the super-capacitors can be more widely used in gadgets such as phones. One of the first applications of the work could be as a storage system for solar power plants. Super-capacitors on the rear of solar cells could store power as it is collected and then dispense it during the night when demand grows. "All the things that define us in a modern environment require electricity," said Prof Pint. "The more that we can integrate power storage into existing materials and devices, the more compact and efficient they will become." </body>

      <body>Samsung Electronics has apologised to Chinese consumers after a report carried on China's state TV claimed some of its phones were malfunctioning. The report alleged the phones were crashing due to faulty memory chips and criticised its repair policies. Samsung, which generates nearly 14% of its overall revenue from China. said it would provide free repairs for the seven models mentioned in the report. In a separate development Samsung was also fined by Taiwanese authorities. Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission levied a fine of fined 10m Taiwanese dollars ($340,000; £210,000) over allegations that Samsung had paid money to people to criticise rival's products. China is the world's second largest economy and the most populous country, The combination of a growing economy, rising income levels and a large consumer base has made it a key market for leading global firms. However, as foreign companies continue to grow their business in China, they have come under increased scrutiny. Samsung, which is the latest foreign firm to be criticised in the Chinese media, said in statement that it "sincerely apologises" to Chinese consumers for inconveniences caused by the company's "management problems" and that it welcomed the media scrutiny. The models mentioned in the China Central Television (CCTV) report on Samsung, which was aired earlier this week, include the Galaxy S3 and the Note2 phones. Earlier this week, a separate report on CCTV claimed that Starbucks, the world's largest coffee chain, was charging higher prices in China than in other major markets. It alleged that Starbucks earned higher margins in China due to its pricing. In April, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook apologised to Chinese consumers following two weeks of criticism by state-owned media over its repair and warranty policies, The media accused the firm of arrogance, greed and of "throwing its weight around". The fine in Taiwan came after an inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission alleged that Samsung had hired the services of an advertising firm, OpenTide Taiwan, to help it with online marketing. Sun Lih-Chyun, vice chairperson and spokesman, told the BBC's Cindy Sui in Taipei that its investigations had indicated that OpenTide had hired students and bloggers to post remarks about Samsung and also criticise rivals' products. He added that OpenTide gave weekly and monthly reports to Samsung, on online remarks, which indicated that Samsung was fully aware of what was going on. OpenTide was also fined 3m Taiwanese dollars by the commission for its role. The allegations had first come to light in April this year. At that time, Samsung had called the incidents "unfortunate" and said they had gone against the company's "fundamental principles". In early 2013, Samsung was fined by Taiwanese authorities for an advert that misled consumers about the camera on the Galaxy Y Duo. </body>

      <body>The Advertising Standards Authority has told BT to change a TV advertisement, following complaints about claims it made about wi-fi interference. In the advert, BT said its new Home Hub could handle interference caused by gadgets that use the same radio spectrum as wi-fi. The ad showed gadgets such as mobile phones and radios, wrongly suggesting they could slow wi-fi speeds. BT said it would review its ad approval process in the wake of the ruling. The ASA said the advert was misleading because of the prominence it gave to devices, such as phones and radios, that did not interfere with wi-fi signals. In its judgement, the ASA acknowledged evidence cited by BT suggesting some non-wi-fi devices, such as baby monitors and video senders, could interfere with wi-fi but said these did not feature significantly enough in the advert. "We considered that the inclusion of images of mobile phones and radios implied that consumers who had those items in their homes may experience problems due to interference when we had not seen any evidence to that effect," it said. The ASA has told BT that the advert must not be broadcast in its current form. In an official statement , BT said the ASA had agreed that some household devices could interfere with wi-fi but conceded the watchdog's point that such devices had not featured enough in the advert. "We are reviewing our legal sign-off processes to ensure that creative visuals accurately reflect our substantiation in future TV ads," it added. </body>

      <body>Facebook has removed a video clip showing a woman's decapitation and issued new rules about what can be shared on its site. The U-turn comes two days after it was revealed the firm had dropped a ban on clips showing extreme violence. The BBC understands that Facebook did this in July after issuing new guidance to staff, but did not think the public would be interested to know. The British prime minister has accused the firm of being "irresponsible". Facebook's own safety advisers have also voiced concerns. The US firm now says it will still allow some graphic content but will take a more comprehensive look at its context. This time Facebook outlined its revised policy in a press release. "First, when we review content that is reported to us, we will take a more holistic look at the context surrounding a violent image or video, and will remove content that celebrates violence," it said. "Second, we will consider whether the person posting the content is sharing it responsibly, such as accompanying the video or image with a warning and sharing it with an age-appropriate audience. "Based on these enhanced standards, we have re-examined recent reports of graphic content and have concluded that this content improperly and irresponsibly glorifies violence. For this reason, we have removed it." At time of writing other decapitation videos could still be found on the site without warning messages. The announcement follows a series of flip-flops by the company. On May 1, when questioned about death clips being shared on the site, the firm told the BBC that its users had the right to depict the "world in which we live". However, less than two hours after the BBC published an interview with one of the firm's safety advisers - who raised concerns about the harm this could cause teenagers - it announced a change of tack. "We will remove instances of these videos that are reported to us while we evaluate our policy and approach to this type of content," it declared. The company promised at the time to announce its decision when the review was completed. But at the start of this week the BBC was contacted by one of the social network's members who had complained about a clip uploaded on 16 October, which the company was refusing to take down. "The video shows a woman having her head cut off by a man in a mask," the user wrote. "She is alive when this happens. Looking at the comments a load of people have reported this to Facebook and had the same reply." An Australian police force was among those who had complained. It said it had been told by Facebook's moderators that the video "did not violate our community standard on graphic violence". When questioned on Monday, a spokeswoman for Facebook confirmed that the ban had indeed been dropped and that the company had introduced a new rule: such material could be posted and shared on the site so long as the original post did not celebrate or encourage the actions depicted. This prompted David Cameron to tweet on Tuesday: "It's irresponsible of Facebook to post beheading videos, especially without a warning. They must explain their actions to worried parents." Stephen Balkam, the chief executive of the Family Online Safety Institute (Fosi) charity - who sits on the network's Safety Advisory Board - said he was "unhappy" at the move, which he had not been told about in advance. Many of the site's users also questioned why it allowed such extreme footage but banned images and videos showing a woman's "fully exposed breast". Facebook subsequently added an alert to the video, replacing the banner image with the words: "Warning! This video contains extremely graphic content and may be upsetting." But last night it changed its policy again, and visitors to the page are now told: "This content is currently unavailable." In response Mr Cameron tweeted: "I'm pleased Facebook has changed its approach on beheading videos. The test is now to ensure their policy is robust in protecting children." Mr Balkam also welcomed the move. "The Family Online Safety Institute is encouraged by the changes that Facebook announced today to the posting of graphic or disturbing material," he said in a statement. "In order to protect young people in particular, it is imperative that Facebook - and all other social media sites - have in place a review process for this type of material and provide warnings where appropriate." London-based Childnet International, another of Facebook's safety advisers, said it still wanted more information. "If they've taken it down I welcome that," said the charity's chief executive Will Gardner told the BBC. "But I want to find out more and look into this further." Google's rival Google+ social network has more restrictive guidelines on graphic content: "Do not distribute depictions of graphic or gratuitous violence," it states. There are videos on its YouTube service in which people discuss beheadings and provide links to explicit footage, but the firm has removed videos showing the act of murder from its own site. "While YouTube's guidelines generally prohibit graphic or violent content, we make exceptions for material with documentary, or news value," a spokesman added. "In cases where a video is not suitable for all viewers, we're careful to apply warnings and age-restrictions to safeguard people using our site." </body>

      <title>New top-level web domains announced</title>
      <description>Four new generic top-level domains - the letters that appear at the end of web addresses, such as .com - have been announced.</description>

      <body>Four new generic top-level domains - the letters that appear at the end of web addresses, such as .com - have been announced. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann) is expected to roll out the new names within weeks. They are: شبكة, the Arabic word for "web"; 游戏, the Chinese word for "game"; and the Russian words for "online" and "web site", онлайн and сайт. Icann hopes hundreds of new top-level domains will eventually be made. Until now, generic top-level domains (gTLDS) - as they are known - were limited to mostly familiar endings such as .com, .net and .biz. But Icann has decided to open this system up, inviting companies to submit applications for names they would like to register. Firms came forward to request almost 2,000 new names including the likes of .porn, .ninja, and .ferrari. The BBC expressed an interest in .bbc. Google made 101 requests, including .google and .youtube, and also had more unexpected ideas such as .and, .boo, .dad and .new. It will take some time for Icann to process all of those requests, particularly in cases where more than one firm wants to own the same gTLD - such as .music, requested by both Amazon and Google. The most popular domain name was .app - with 13 different companies interested in it. Wednesday's announcement marks the first set of domains in the new system to be approved. "You'll note that all four of these new strings are Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)," said Christine Willett, vice president of the gTLD program, in a blog post. "This will be the first time non-Latin characters can be used in a generic TLD." She added: "The move is an effort to create a more inclusive internet." The new domains will now "proceed to delegation", the final stage before being made live - expected to happen within the next couple of weeks. </body>

      <title>Teenagers' anti-sexting app launched</title>
      <description>A children's charity launches a mobile phone app to help teenagers refuse requests for explicit images of themselves.</description>

      <body>A charity has launched a mobile phone app to help teenagers refuse requests for explicit images of themselves. The free app from Childline offers users a choice of what the charity says are "witty responses" to send instead. "Sexting" - the sending of intimate images or videos by mobile phone or online - has become so common "it is considered mundane", the charity says. About six out of 10 of those aged from 12 to 15 are thought to own a smartphone. In a recent NSPCC/ChildLine survey, six out of 10 teenagers said they had been asked for sexual images of themselves. The survey - of 450 people - was self-selecting, but the charity said it reflected the results of other studies. The new app - called Zipit - also offers advice on safe online chatting and on what young people should do if they feel threatened or if an image becomes public. One 17-year-old boy told Childline sexting was "pretty normal" among his friends. "My friends and I talk very openly about our experiences within our relationships, and the sort of things we've sent each other. It seems like everyone's doing it." He said he sometimes got bad reactions to things he sent - but it did not bother him enough to stop. "Someone saw a video message I had sent to a previous girlfriend, took a screen shot and posted it online. They called me a pervert and lots of people I knew saw it. "I was completely devastated and, to be honest, almost suicidal." Peter Liver, from ChildLine, said: "We hope Zipit will give [young people] the tools to defuse the pressure to send, share or collect these images." The charity has also teamed up with the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) to help young people get explicit images of themselves removed from the internet. </body>

      <body>The home of Britain's World War II codebreakers will offer internet safety advice to children when a restoration project finishes next year. The Bletchley Park Trust hopes annual visitor numbers to the site near Milton Keynes will rise to 250,000. Software firm McAfee will be a partner in providing an IT learning zone and cybersecurity exhibition. The trust said it hoped the attractions would inspire the 16,000 children it expected to attend each year. Bletchley Park, which is currently open to visitors with tours and a museum, was the highly secretive site where teams, including the "father of computing" Alan Turing, broke the German Enigma codes. The trust is aiming to complete the work in time for the 70th anniversary of the World War II D-Day invasion of France, next June. The learning zone and security exhibition will be built in a derelict block on the estate. Ian Standen, trust chief executive, said: "The work undertaken at Bletchley made a real difference and helped to change the course of history. "We hope to inspire the next generation of potential codebreakers and cybersecurity experts to keep us safe in the digital world." Gert-Jan Schenk, European president at McAfee, said: "Working with Bletchley Park allows us to make a real impact on the cyber security education of children, not to mention the chance to help commemorate the part Bletchley Park played in the birth of the information age." </body>

      <title>Ebay aims for one-hour delivery</title>
      <description>Ebay announces it will acquire start-up Shutl as it aims to bring one-hour delivery to the UK.</description>

      <body>Ebay has announced it is to acquire start-up Shutl in a bid to bring one-hour delivery to the UK. The service will be offered when both seller and buyer are in the same area. The online auction site already has a similar service in San Francisco and New York, and hopes, with Shutl, to add more than 20 other US cities next year. The UK service will start in London. Speedy delivery is seen as a key growth area for retailers, with rivals such as Amazon also rolling out new services. Its AmazonFresh offering, which is so far only available in Los Angeles or Seattle, sources products from grocery shops, restaurants and other local businesses - essentially acting as a enhanced courier service. Other start-ups such as San Francisco-based Instacart promise the same, although its approach is not to have any direct tie-up with retailers. "Today, approximately 75% of what people buy is local, found within 15 miles from their home," said eBaymarketplaces president Devin Wenig in a statement announcing the Shutl acquisition. "Traditional retail isn't going away. But it is transforming, and that creates enormous opportunity within the $10 trillion total commerce market." No financial details of the deal were disclosed by either company. Shutl already operates in the UK, counting retailers such as Schuh, Warehouse and Argos among its clients. It allows customers to choose as-soon-as-possible delivery - its record is just under 14 minutes - or to select a one-hour window in which to receive the goods. Using rapid delivery comes at a cost - Shutl adds an extra £6.99 to some products if they are needed quickly. Founder and chief executive Tom Allason said that Shutl would continue to work with all its existing partners, but would expand to accommodate eBay's plans. "E-commerce is quick and convenient, two things that delivery is not," wrote Mr Allason. "Together with eBay, we believe that we can transform this market and fulfil our mission." </body>

      <title>Google Chrome adds parental controls</title>
      <description>Google's web browser, Chrome, introduces controls that allow parents to monitor their children's browsing history and block certain websites.</description>

      <body>Google has introduced controls to its Chrome web browser that allow parents to monitor and control the browsing behaviour of their children. The new feature, called "supervised users", allows "managers" to set up profiles of the people they want to monitor. Managers can view the supervised users' browsing history, block specific sites, and approve access requests. The feature is available on Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems. It is also available to Chromebook users. But Google says the default setting is to allow a newly created supervised user to view all websites - managers have to specify what sites they want to block. SafeSearch is activated automatically for supervised users, preventing most adult content from appearing in Google search results. The move comes after growing concerns over inappropriate content children can be exposed to online. Other browsers, including Microsoft's Internet Explorer, offer content controls that can be set by an administrator. Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system enables users to set up a "Kid's Corner" section on the phone that only allows access to specified games, music, videos and apps. Kids are unable to access disallowed websites. A recent survey found that many youngsters aged nine to 11 were engaging in risky behaviour online, such as sharing personal information and playing games rated for much older children, including the 18-rated Call of Duty series. ISC2, an organisation which helps schools educate children about web safety, also found that 43% of youngsters went online every day and 46% spent more than two hours online every time they did so. Another survey, by the Anti-Bullying Alliance, found that 69% of teachers and 40% of young people thought online safety should be taught in more schools and included in the national curriculum. </body>

      <body>The creators of legendary adventure game Myst are seeking cash for a new game via Kickstarter. Cyan Worlds is looking for $1.1m (£679,000) from the crowdfunding site to develop a game called Obduction. The game-maker said its new title would be a spiritual successor to its earlier point-and-click adventure games Myst and Riven. If Cyan reaches its funding target it plans to release PC and Mac versions of Obduction in mid-2015. Released in 1993, Myst was a huge hit thanks to its sumptuous look, detailed world-building and intricate puzzles. On its Kickstarter page, Cyan said Obduction would continue with these traditions but update them to take advantage of the power of modern computers. It said the game would use the Unreal 4 game development engine to create a detailed far-flung world that players find themselves upon at the start of the game. Playing Obduction involves exploring the world, solving puzzles and working out why the player has been abducted and taken to the alien planet. The cash being sought was for the most basic version of the game, said Cyan. Cash raised beyond the original total would go towards making the game world bigger and moving the title to other gaming gadgets beyond PCs. Cyan said it was turning to Kickstarter because it allowed the company to connect with fans, meant it had control of development and ensured everyone involved had an intimate link to the project. Nathan Grayson at PC game news website Rock, Paper Shotgun said the "meagre" information provided by Cyan did not give a good idea about how the final game might turn out. He wondered if the game would reach its funding target despite getting pledges of more than $100,000 within a day of being kicked off. "Obduction really does feel like it'd be a shoo-in if it wasn't currently a pile of napkin scrawlings and a series of excited hand gestures," he wrote. </body>

      <body>A senior White House official has been sacked after being unmasked as the man behind a widely read Twitter account that provided an abrasive commentary on his colleagues for more than two years. A government official said Jofi Joseph, 40, was fired from his job on the National Security Council nuclear non-proliferation team. Mr Joseph posted under the now defunct Twitter name @NatSecWonk. He apologised for his "inappropriate and mean-spirited comments". In his tweets, Mr Joseph gave a lacerating commentary on anything from policy to personal appearance. "Was Huma Abedin wearing beer goggles the night she met Anthony Weiner," he tweeted, referring to the scandal-hit former New York mayoral candidate and his wife, a former aide of Hillary Clinton. "Almost as bad a pairing as Samantha Powers and Cass Sunstein," he added, referring the US envoy to the UN and her husband, who is a former White House official. This month, Mr Joseph joined Republican attacks on Mrs Clinton for perceived failings of her handling of last year's attack on the US diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya. He tweeted that Mrs Clinton "had few policy goals and no wins" in the Middle East. He said Chelsea Clinton was "assuming all of her parents' vices" and targeted figures such as Republican commentator Liz Cheney and Mitt Romney's wife Ann for their looks and weight. Mr Joseph also turned his caustic commentary on Republicans. "So when will someone do us the favor of getting rid of Sarah Palin and the rest of her white trash family?" he tweeted last October. "What utter useless garbage." Mr Joseph's wife is reportedly a staff member for Republicans on the Senate foreign relations committee. The Daily Beast website broke the news of his sacking, describing it as a shock and saying Mr Joseph was "well known among policy wonks". But it said that "inside the administration, there was little sympathy for the man who they feel had betrayed their confidence while taunting them all the while". The website Politico said White House officials had worked over months to discover the identity of Mr Joseph - a key member of the team negotiating over Iran's nuclear programme. It said his travel and shopping habits had been profiled by parsing over 2,000 tweets. Politico said his tweets had been "obsessively and angrily followed" by Washington officials, even though the messages had been "barely noticed" outside the capital. In an apology emailed to Politico, Mr Joseph said: "It has been a privilege to serve in this administration and I deeply regret violating the trust and confidence placed in me. "What started out as an intended parody account of DC culture developed over time into a series of inappropriate and mean-spirited comments. I bear complete responsibility for this affair and I sincerely apologise to everyone I insulted." </body>

      <body>Earlier this year the court of appeal dismissed a case brought by Tesla cars against the BBC's Top Gear show in which the car manufacturer asserted that the programme had faked a scene which appeared to show a Tesla Roadster running out of power. The California-based car maker claimed that the episode in 2008 had caused sales of the electric sports car to drop. However, the court of appeal rejected the claim that the report on the often provocative programme had damaged the company's reputation. BBC Newsnight's Gavin Esler went to talk to Mr Musk, the founder of Tesla, SpaceX and PayPal, whose latest proposal is a near-supersonic Hyperloop transport link between Los Angeles and San Francisco.

      <body>The economic climate is tough, and student fees are high. Against this backdrop, more and more desperate students are going online to try and raise funds from strangers. Following the Kickstarter model used to raise capital for business ideas, they are trying to persuade people that their cause is worth supporting. Ackeem Ngwenya owes London's Royal College of Art over £20,000, and he can only graduate once the tuition fees are paid. So in desperation he has started a campaign on a crowdfunding website. His graduation design project is informed by his childhood growing up in a Malawian rural community, where he had to carry corn for miles each day on terrible roads. Ackeem has developed a wheel that can be manually adapted to suit different terrains. But will he reach his target, and develop the project which has become his obsession? He thinks the internet is his only hope. Video Journalist: Dougal Shaw Real Time is a series for the BBC News website in which ordinary people tell their own extraordinary stories. </body>

      <description>Meeting the faces behind technology's most iconic voices</description>

      <body>Millions of people hear their voices every day - but would you recognise them if you saw them walking down the street? Well maybe now you will. The BBC met the faces behind four of the most famous and iconic voices heard in technology today. Siri, Apple's voice-powered personal assistant, made its debut in June 2010. Since then, millions of the devices with the feature have been sold worldwide. In the UK, the voice you will hear responding to commands belongs to Jon Briggs, an illustrious voiceover artist whose portfolio includes the likes of the Weakest Link, Radio 2 and Channel 4. Jon had offered up his voice to a firm that specialises in computer-generated speech - that is, taking Jon's voice but moulding it to say virtually any possible phrase. Apple, when creating Siri, picked out Jon - unbeknownst to him. "I discovered that I was being used as the voice of Siri when Rory Cellan-Jones, the BBC technology correspondent, suddenly started demonstrating it on BBC Breakfast. "I thought 'I recognise that voice!', and so it was true - and it's a slightly bizarre journey since then." It means that while his voice is now being played out countless times a day all over the country, Apple has not paid him - he only received the fee earned he when recording the original material. But, he says he's excited to be "in early" on what he believes is changing how we use technology. "You can take a photograph of your desk - there is a screen a keyboard and a mouse. "You will show it to your children or your grandchildren and they will laugh and go 'you had a thing called a mouse? What's that funny thing with letters on?'" In contrast to the received pronunciation of her "Tube" voice, Emma Clarke's speaking voice is in fact Northern - growing up, as she did, in Sale near Manchester. Her voice can be heard across the Bakerloo, Central and District lines of London's iconic Underground network. The process of getting the job was long and painstaking - months of focus groups and whittling down possible candidates. During the selection, each possible voice was given a codename. Emma's, apparently, was 'Marilyn'. "Had they named me 'Brenda' I'm not sure I'd have got the gig," she jokes. She now gets fan mail from all over the world, particularly from Texas. "People initially thought I was actually on the train!" she says, "Or in some kind of central control room. I don't know where they thought it was." She says she is proud to lend her voice to the network, but adds that she hopes some of the lines she recorded never have to be heard by the public. "There were a couple of emergency announcements, that I remember when I read them on the script I thought 'oh god, imagine how these people will feel when they hear these announcements. "I felt such a sense of responsibility, of calming people down." Unlike the other voices in this piece, Terry Green is the only one who doesn't consider his voice to be his profession. He found his way to audio fame indirectly. He specialises in customer service, and the systems used in shops to get things moving and punters through the tills. And so it was, when the company he was working for needed a male voice to beckon people to the till, he stepped forward: "Cashier number three, please..." "We just sat down with a digital voice recorder, laid down the track, and that was it! I was on the prototype system, and then suddenly rolled out to 8,000 shops." They recorded up to cashier number 25 - but now the system goes much further. Indeed, around the world, the company's technology is used in thousands of stores - although with local voices instead of Terry's. Now he makes his living as a leading expert on the study of shoppers' behaviour. "My voice was on all these systems that we were rolling out, so I was becoming more and better known. I started writing white papers, and eventually I came to write a book." One morning, Sara Mendes da Costa was listening to Terry Wogan on Radio 2 when he mentioned that a competition would be held to find the new voice of the Speaking Clock. "A little bell rang in my head and I went 'oooh!'" She wasn't alone - within moments she had had calls friends and family saying she should put herself forward. She won, and from 2007 she took over the voice of the Speaking Clock, which is called up approximately 60 million times each year. It was a job she was excited, but nervous, to take on. "Brian Cobby, who sadly passed away last year, had the most beautiful, rich, Shakespearian voice. "Then I came along - I have visions of people going 'oh...'!" "But they wanted something different, someone a bit more of the moment, a little bit more who we are now." Sara uses the Speaking Clock regularly in her day-to-day work, and admits she just can't resist listening to each and every word. "I listen until when it goes through to 'precisely' - and only then I can hang up! "It's just a weird thing that I've got." Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <title>The phone you can build like Lego</title>
      <description>The Dutch mobile you put together from separate modules</description>

      <body>A new mobile phone concept that would give users a chance to choose from a range of components, and replace or upgrade them when necessary, has generated enormous interest online. But could this sustainable, modular device ever become a reality? Six months ago, the Dutch designer Dave Hakkens took apart his favourite camera. "I noticed all these little parts," he says. "And everything was good except for the lens motor. That had broken." But when Hakkens contacted the manufacturer to get a replacement motor, he was advised to just replace the whole camera. "With your bike you repair the tyre, you don't throw the bike away," he says. "But for some reason this is what we do with electronics." Hakkens realised that if a device could be taken apart and upgraded more easily it would last much longer, minimising electrical waste. And so the idea of Phonebloks was born. The concept - Hakkens hasn't figured out how to actually make it - is for a phone with a replaceable screen and easily moveable, changeable "bloks", each containing a different element such as battery, chipset, gyroscope and so on. In the video Hakkens made to publicise Phonebloks, the bits fall into place on the backplate of the phone like pieces of Lego. The bloks vary in size and can be made to tessellate in any number of combinations. "Let's say this is your phone and you do everything in the cloud - why not replace your storage blok with a bigger battery blok?" asks the voiceover. "If you're like this guy and love to take pictures, why not upgrade your camera?" Last month, Hakkens set about showing off Phonebloks using the "crowd speaking" platform Thunderclap. Users donate their social reach to a project they support, allowing the site to commandeer their Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook accounts to broadcast a message at a single, predetermined moment. Hakkens was aiming for 500 people to sign up to his Thunderclap, but the Phonebloks video went viral, gaining seven million views in three days. He has now amassed 950,000 Thunderclap supporters and on Tuesday the Phonebloks video will ping across social networks 375 million times. "It comes down to a consumer signal," says Kyle Wiens, the founder of iFixit.com, a repository for user-generated repair manuals to the latest gadgets. "The market needs to indicate to manufacturers that we care about modular, repairable hardware." Phones have never been as modular as computers, but Wiens says they used to be sturdier and more repairable. Take batteries. Until the iPhone came along in 2007, batteries on all handsets could be readily removed. With every new phone the power source is a little bit harder to get to, stuck down with more glue, or tucked away in a case that's more impregnable. To get the battery out of the HTC One, the geeks at iFixit had to mangle the phone's casing and remove the motherboard. "I wish batteries were more replaceable than they are," says Bruce Harvey, an electrical engineer at Florida State University. "The reason they're not is in order to make the phone so small, the battery's shape is conformed to fit in there, rather than be a square block [like Phonebloks]." It is consumer preference for a small phone that has pushed manufacturers to hide their batteries away. In the same way, our craving for ever-slimmer, speedier phones has led them to pile hardware - such as the central processor, memory and wifi - on to the same chip, not separate them out into blocks. Harvey believes that Phonebloks is a technical challenge but an achievable one. The bloks could talk to one another if they were all designed to work with the same signalling system. However, he says the real difficulty would be in making a modular phone robust enough to survive the "harsh environment" of the trouser pocket. Each component would have to be encased in a material such as plastic, adding thickness and making the device less sexy. "It's one of those things where if people look at it they say, 'Wow, I can be more ecologically sound, I get upgrades when I want to…'" he says. "Then someone shows them that their phone's going to be six-tenths of an inch (1.5cm) thick or something like that. Reality will meet up with hopes and dreams." The challenge of marketing a modular system doesn't end with the chubbiness problem. "We sadly live in a disposable society and people do have an expectation that they will change their phone every so often," says Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight (and proud owner of more than 800 handsets going back two decades). How long people hang on to a handset varies across the world. On average it's just over three years, but in the US it's just 20 months. Although new devices are almost always bought on a contract, people have come to regard their new phone as a "free upgrade". Lots of us wait impatiently for upgrade day - phone technology is advancing so fast that multiple components, though still functional, feel outdated after a couple of years. However, this trend may not continue indefinitely, Wood says. Mobile phones could be approaching an "innovation plateau" where the basics like speed and screen resolution are as good as they can get. Add to this the regular software "drops" that make our phones feel like new, and people might start hanging on to their handsets for longer. In this kind of market, Phonebloks might become viable, Wood argues. Home computers reached an innovation plateau some years ago, but while we replace our computers less frequently than we used to, not many of us exploit the modular nature of our PCs and upgrade the modules. However, in Hakkens's view that's because it isn't easy enough - only "die-hard geeks" are willing to reach for a screwdriver to unscrew their memory or motherboard. Price is arguably the least important factor in the mobile phone market, but it may represent another challenge for Phonebloks. In the long run, you might think consumers would save money with a modular system that can be continually upgraded and never needs chucking out, but this may not be the case. Big phone companies achieve enormous efficiencies of scale by negotiating special rates with parts manufacturers, buying up production capacity for months at a time. In return, the parts manufacturers get investment for research and development and a guarantee of future business. The idea of marketing "bloks" to end-consumers through a "blokstore" might not be so appealing to these companies, which might in turn prevent similar economies of scale being achieved. Hakkens recognises that neither the big phone companies nor the manufacturers that work with them are likely to jump at his idea - he sees it as a chance for other electronics companies to enter the fray. He says he has been approached by a number of companies and individuals excited about getting involved. "Right now, I'm thinking about what would be the best next step," he says. "Would it be to build it myself, open-source, online - or partner up with companies and collaborators?" He seems to have been caught off guard by the attention his little idea is receiving. "I wasn't planning to do a next step," he admits, "but now I have all these people offering help." Kyle Wiens and Ben Wood are enthusiastic about Phonebloks, but they both believe the concept might end in a half-way house - a phone in which the battery and screen, and possibly the memory and camera, can be easily replaced. For Wiens, the key to making a green phone is different - a design durable enough for the device to reach a second-hand market. "The whole phone doesn't need to be modular so long as it can be repaired and kept in service," he says. Dave Hakkens doesn't pretend to have all the answers, or even certainty that Phonebloks will see the light of day. "Half of the world says it's possible, the other half says it's not possible," he says. "I don't think anyone really knows because no-one's really tried it. So that's the next thing to do - just figure it out." Dave Hakkens spoke to Click on the BBC World Service - listen again to the programme on iPlayer or get the Click podcast.

      <title>Can technology help avoid stampedes?</title>
      <description>Can technology help avoid stampedes?</description>

      <body>It seems the cruellest and most unnecessary of deaths - to be crushed in the midst of a crowd. But even in the 21st Century such deaths are still common, as a stampede at a recent Hindu festival in India, which killed about 115 people, proved all too sadly. Horror quickly turned to anger as the Indian media reported that better crowd management could have prevented the tragedy. But can technology also play a role in making sure that such disasters are not repeated? At the Hajj pilgrimage, the world's largest Islamic gathering, which takes place in October, the authorities now use live crowd analytics software, which can not only spot problems in the crowd but also claims to be able to predict where overcrowding is likely to happen. Live data feeds come into a large operations room where they are analysed by military personnel, the police and other crowd managers. The software provides accurate and real-time data on crowd numbers, densities, distributions and flows. "Crowds can be dangerous places. Whether triggered by factions within the crowd, by natural disasters or misguided crowd managers, there is a long history of crushes, stampedes and failed evacuations," said Fiona Strens who co-founded CrowdVision, the firm behind the software. "It spots patterns of crowd behaviour that indicate potential danger such as high densities, pressure, turbulence, stop-and-go waves and other anomalies." As large-scale events go the Hajj is one of the biggest and it has a pretty bad track record; over the years thousands of lives have been lost. One of the worst incidents occurred in 2006 when a stampede on the last day of the pilgrimage killed at least 346 pilgrims and injured another 200. As part of his PhD research, CrowdVision co-founder Dr Anders Johansson analysed the CCTV images of the pilgrims before and during the crush in 2006, and realised that there were patterns of behaviours that, spotted early enough, could have prevented it. In 2007, his system was installed in Mecca and it has been monitoring the pilgrimage every year since. While the company doesn't like to tempt fate, since its involvement, no fatalities have occurred. That isn't entirely down to the technology though, admits Ms Strens. "In recent years the Mecca authorities have invested in better infrastructure, planning and technology to assure pilgrim safety but we play a very important role providing the real-time data and insights needed to inform operational decision-making," she said. For their part, the Saudi authorities are pleased to have such a technology partner. "The live crowd analysis greatly improves safety of pilgrims," said Dr Salim al Bosta, crowd management expert, at the ministry of municipal and rural affairs. But crowd scientist Keith Still, who was special adviser on the Hajj from 2001 and 2005, is more sceptical about how much technology can help in such places. "Any technology has to be coupled with a crowd management plan," he told the BBC. In fact he thinks that technology installed at the Hajj in 2006 - before CrowdVision's involvement - actually contributed to the tragedy that unfolded. "Tech firms offered the Saudis new systems and there was an over-reliance on technology. There was lots of digital signage put up to direct the crowds but it was just a mess," he said. He is also sceptical about whether the technology used by CrowdVision can work in a live situation. "It spots shockwaves in the crowd but if these are happening then you are already at a point where people could be crushed or seriously injured. Whoever is in control has fundamentally lost control of the situation by then," he said. "It could become an exercise in futility." For him, the value of CrowdVision lies more in its ability to precisely count how many people are at an event. "If you need to track capacity such tools are great but it is a long way away from being a risk management system," he said. Cities around the world are getting more and more overcrowded. By 2050 the UN expects the world's population to top nine billion, with nearly 70% of them living in towns. And people are spending more time in crowds. Large-scale music and sporting events are commonplace, as are big screens that beam events to public places to allow those outside of venues to watch the action. Spontaneous street protests are also on the rise, thanks to the proliferation of social media and smartphones. Technology that can monitor crowds is going to become increasingly important, thinks Ovum analyst Joe Dignan. "Understanding how people move through a city will help develop smart transport systems and keep people safe in times of danger whether natural or manmade," he said. Whether crowds gather to protest, to party or just to be entertained, things can turn ugly in an instant. Heat maps created by CrowdVision to show how people behaved during a practice evacuation of a city skyscraper illustrate how danger points can build up even when the crowd is flowing well and is relatively calm. The maps showed that even when the crowd was re-entering the building after the evacuation, there were some dangerous queues building up. Nowhere is crowd control more important than at a music festival and the software developed by CrowdVision suggests that organisers may be making fundamental errors by posting stewards at the front of crowds. "The maps suggested the problems were actually in the middle of the crowd," said Ms Strens. "If the stewards had tablets with real-time information on them, they could see exactly where they needed to be," she added. Such a solution may not have been realistic for Madhya Pradesh, the Indian state where the recent stampede occurred. It seems likely the stampede was sparked by panic, following rumours a bridge people were crossing was about to collapse. The bridge had itself been built in response to a stampede at the same temple some seven years earlier, when attendees had been crushed crossing the river. It illustrates that, however carefully planned an event is, there is often no accounting for human behaviour. Technology may help but it is only ever going to be part of the solution, according to Prof Still. "The best way to avoid this in the future is education on crowd safety," he said. </body>

      <title>Roller coasters set to get scarier</title>
      <description>The future of roller coasters</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24553630</url>
      <date>1382482853</date>

      <body>Technology has transformed the theme park thrill ride, fuelling a global arms race to create the fastest, tallest, scariest roller coasters the world has ever known. Alton Towers in Staffordshire has just opened the world's first 14-loop roller coaster, called The Smiler, while in Abu Dhabi, Ferrari World claims to have the world's fastest coaster. But are we reaching the limits of what the human body - and theme park budgets - can stand? What will the thrill ride of the future look like? Ferrari World's Formula Rossa ride blasts passengers from 0-149mph (240km/h) in just 4.9 seconds, with riders experiencing 4.8G during acceleration - G-forces only fighter pilots usually feel. Its huge 25-tonne hydraulic winch and compressed nitrogen gas system produces 21,000 horsepower, 20 times that of a Formula 1 racing car. John Wardley, designer of the Nemesis, Oblivion and Air rides at Alton Towers, said: "While we can withstand 6-8Gs for very short periods of time, if we experience 5G for more than five seconds, say, we're likely to black out. "We can't push people any further than they can go at the moment." On modern rides passengers experience about 3G in tight turns and loops, and zero G - the feeling of weightlessness - when upside down or flying over parabolic "bunny hills" and "camel backs". "We reached the limit of G-forces a while ago, but there is no technological limit to how fast or how high roller coasters can go - it's all down to money," said Justin Garvanovic, founder of the European Coaster Club. So what are the technologies that have enabled this move towards extreme rides? The big breakthrough was the linear synchronous motor (LSM), capable of launching passengers from 0-70mph in about two seconds. It is the same technology being developed by the US navy to propel jets from aircraft carriers as a replacement for the traditional steam piston catapult. LSMs employ a series of electromagnets fired in sequence, with power being supplied from the latest generation of highly-efficient batteries. They combine the launch, drive wheels and brake mechanisms all in one, allowing for blistering acceleration and equally effective braking by reversing the polarity of the electromagnets. Crucially, this allows designers to reverse the direction of the ride, doubling the thrills without doubling the length of track. The other major breakthrough has been 3D design engineering software from the likes of Autodesk, CATIA and Solidworks. "Our software allows designers to create highly accurate digital prototypes and understand how a ride will behave before they build it," Carl Bass, Autodesk chief executive, told the BBC. "It can predict the weakest point in the design; the likely fatigue rate of the materials; the speeds and G-forces." This software, together with tubular steel tracks, innovative car and harness designs, and LSMs, have given designers the freedom to incorporate multiple launches and all sorts of vertical rolls, loops and corkscrews traditional coasters could never have managed. For example, Projekt Helix, a 2014 coaster being developed by Mack Rides for the Liseberg amusement park in Sweden, will include two launches - Europe's first multi-launch coaster - accelerating riders to 62mph at 4.2G. The two-minute ride will include a "pretzel loop", a twisted air-time hump, s-curves and a zero-G roll. But insiders believe the thrill ride arms race is coming to an end because the costs are spiralling out of control. Rides can cost from £2.5m to £25m, depending on their size and sophistication, with the likes of Disney spending even more on themed rides involving elaborate sets and animatronics. Alton Towers' The Smiler cost £18m to build, while Projekt Helix will cost 23m euros (£19.5m). "People were spending stupid money and had to take a step back," said Mr Garvanovic. Steve Boney, spokesman for Maurer Soehne, a German thrill ride manufacturer, said: "There is a law of diminishing returns. As the magnets get bigger, they get heavier and much more expensive, and this pushes up the construction costs. Achieving an extra 50km/h [31mph] costs an extra three to four million euros [£2.5m-£3.5m]. "And greater speeds mean you have to increase the allowed rider heights, so fewer kids can go on the ride, reducing revenue," he added. As a result there is move towards dark - or indoor - rides where the experience of whizzing round a track is enhanced by audiovisual technologies, like much larger versions of current simulator rides. "The ride of the future will be an entertainment machine, as much about surprise, fun and enchantment as physical thrills," said Mr Wardley. Mr Boney agrees, saying: "Audiovisual technology is where most of the technological innovation is happening." For example, Dynamic Structures, the Canadian company behind the Harry Potter theme rides for Universal Studios, is currently developing a "coal mine-themed" ride for a client in Dubai that will incorporate thrill ride speeds and G-forces with 3D projection effects and robotics. "It will be the most technically advanced ride in the world," Craig Breckenridge, senior designer at Dynamic Structures told the BBC. "We're doing things with coasters that have never been done before, such as switching tracks, and using video and projections that will trick your brain into thinking you're really falling." At certain sections of the ride the cars will drop vertically, laterally, and backwards on a tilting piece of track that takes them underneath where they've just been, said Mr Breckenridge. So as the traditional thrill ride arms race comes to an end, it seems a new era of intense, multi-sensory, immersive dark rides is only just beginning. </body>

      <description>Apple and Microsoft renew their rivalry</description>

      <body>Tuesday saw two big product launches on one day - and from each, interesting signs that an old rivalry might be flaring up again. For 20 years Microsoft and Apple slugged it out - with Bill Gates' company the Goliath and Steve Jobs' firm the plucky David, mostly failing to be anything other than a noisy sideshow. Then competition intensified as Apple came roaring back with its iProducts, but in recent years both companies turned their fire instead on Google as the big new kid on the block threatening to take away their toys. But at Apple's event on Tuesday night, where a new, thinner iPad made the headlines, was more interesting for what it said about the renewed rivalry with Microsoft. It started with the unveiling of new, typically expensive - if very high-specification - computers, those objects supposedly made obsolete by the rise of the tablet. Tim Cook told the audience that this part of the business (from which, by the way, Apple only makes a tiny share of its huge profits) was still vitally important - and he mocked another company that didn't know whether it wanted a tablet to be a PC or vice versa. In the week that Microsoft's Surface 2 goes on sale, it was clear who he was talking about. The only real surprises in the 90-minute show came with the announcements that Mavericks, the latest version of the Mac operating system, would now be free to download and updated versions of its iWork apps, Apple's rival to Microsoft's Office software, would now come free on any new iOS device. Big deal, said anyone from the open source community, where the idea that you would pay for software has long been seen as old-fashioned. But it might be a concern for Microsoft. It still makes big bucks by charging for Windows and Office, so Apple's move could be seen as a direct threat to its business model. Mind you, there had been evidence earlier that Microsoft might at last be making progress in the area where Apple had left it far behind, mobile devices. I'd tuned into the live stream from Abu Dhabi of Nokia World, the phone giant's last big event before it disappears into the embrace of Microsoft. And I came away with two questions - is the Windows Phone operating system finally getting some traction, particularly on the latest Nokia Lumia phones? And does that mean Nokia's board sold the phone business at exactly the wrong time? Nokia's CEO Stephen Elop had the slightly strange job of unveiling some quite impressive new products and software, which will now contribute to the Microsoft bottom line, where he will be running the devices division or possibly the whole business. Lumia is getting larger, with the 1520 Phablet, and Nokia has at long last unveiled a tablet, the Lumia 2520, running the Windows RT operating system. Just how that will be marketed inside Microsoft, where so much has been invested in the Surface, will be an interesting question for Mr Elop. But the amount of innovation that has come out of Nokia in recent months has been truly impressive, in particular in the key area of mobile phone photography, where the Lumia 1020 seems to have the most advanced camera on the market. And finally that seems to be showing in sales, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that eight million Lumias were sold in the last quarter. True, that compares with nine million new iPhones sold in just three days. But momentum is key in this market, and at last Nokia, and hence Microsoft, is getting some. What still deters many from taking the plunge and embracing Windows Phone is a lack of compelling apps. So the most important announcement out of Abu Dhabi was the imminent arrival of Instagram, the vastly popular picture-sharing app whose absence has been a glaring hole in the Windows portfolio. And now there's another opportunity for Windows to make progress at the business end of the mobile industry. With confidence seeping away fast from Blackberry, many organisations will be pondering where to take their business next. Some have already switched to the iPhone, others will wonder about Android, although they may have concerns about security. But enterprises which already have a long-term relationship with Microsoft - and that's just about all of them - may now think that Windows Phone devices can offer them a safe solution to their needs. The Mac v PC battle is going mobile - and if Microsoft does at last manage to make an impression in this world, there could be huge rewards. Nokia's board will then ask itself whether it got the right price for all that innovation now under the control of its former CEO in Redmond. </body>

      <title>Saving digital art from early death</title>
      <description>The race to save computer-generated artworks</description>

      <body>When a renaissance masterpiece needs restoring, simple paints and brushes can do the job. It's all down to human skill. But what do you do when a piece of digital art worth over a million pounds and reliant on obsolete technology and old codes breaks down? The ZKM Centre for Art and Media in Karlsruhe Germany is trying to provide an answer. It has the world's largest collection of digital art, with over 500 pieces in its collection. It's also the global centre for digital art conservation. It is a Herculean effort to keep their artworks running in their original form on computers often decades old. ZKM's staff try to find as much obsolete digital kit as possible. They trawl waste dumps and the auction site eBay in their quest for authenticity. As part of these efforts, they rent a warehouse outside the city where they store over 1,600 cathode ray TV sets, which are now out of production. These old-school TVs make up key elements of some of the art works. For example, Versailles Fountain by digital pioneer Nam June Paik uses about 40 CRT TVs. They are constantly being repaired. In an unlikely alliance, curators at ZKM foster connections with local dump managers who set aside old computers and audio visual machines in exchange for cigarettes. But keeping all of this obsolete equipment in storage is just a short-term solution. Bernhard Serexhe is the principal curator at ZKM's media museum and leader of a European Union funded project on digital art conservation. He says the faster technology develops, the shorter the potential lifespan of the art. "That is why we need a second strategy which is migrating the work, migrating the data of the work to a different platform, or even porting the programme to a different system, to a different computer system which is quite complicated and quite expensive," he says. This is precisely what happened with The Legibile City. Created in 1989 by Jeffrey Shaw, it is considered by Mr Serexhe to be one of the most important pieces of digital art in the world. When you get on the stationary bike, you can cycle through giant 3D letters in three different cities. The faster you pedal, the faster words describing the city appear on screen. The problem is it was designed on a Silicon Graphics computer which went out of production 16 years ago. The museum only has 10 left in storage. The danger is when they are gone the artwork will no longer be displayed. The solution for The Legibile City has been to port it over to a Linux-based operating system. This process took several years and was done in conjunction with the artist's wishes.  "Linux was selected as the target platform for the porting. Linux is a free Unix variant that runs on the most diverse hardware platforms -including on Apple computers - which is constantly being adapted to new hardware, and, current expectations are that due to its origins [Unix], it will have a long lifespan," Mr Serexhe explains. Digital artworks in ZKM are not switched off overnight to preserve the systems and try to prolong the life of the hardware. Not everything in the museum is "born digital", a phrase used by Mr Serexhe to describe art that is completely of the digital age. Digitising video art from magnetic tapes is another important part of the museum's work. Dorcas Muller works in the Laboratory for Antiquated Video Systems. Her office is packed from floor to ceiling with ancient tapes and video equipment. She has over 300 machines at her disposal to convert about 50 different formats into digital form. "The most important machines which are completely restored we keep in the laboratory for daily use and we have storage outside the city where we have machines up to the ceiling for future years," she says. The market for pure digital art is very different from the one for more conventional art. Materials and machines become obsolete while canvas and stone live on. "There is a certain market but normally these works go from the artists to the collector… there are only very few collectors. In Germany at the moment there is only one private collector of digital art," says Mr Serexhe in Germany. But there is no consensus on whether repairing digital art is the right thing to do. Some of the artists may have intended their works be shown as a performance, and to cease existing when the technology running it breaks down. The museum's efforts are controversial. "Either we change our ethical aspect ideas about art, and we would consider digital art as only 'performative', or we stick to the originality and authenticity of the work. "I think as an important collection we still should preserve the work in its original form and format as long as this is possible," Mr Serexhe says.

      <title>Why tech women need a makeover</title>
      <description>How to attract girls to the tech industry</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24537621</url>

      <body>Anne-Marie Imafidon is in a rush to get on with life. Perhaps that is why she passed a GCSE in computer science aged 10, became the youngest graduate to attain a masters degree, aged 19, and is already planning the future of her unborn children. And if daughters come along she is clear that she doesn't want them to "feel like the odd ones out," if they decide, like her, to pursue a career in technology. As a self-confessed stubborn woman, she hopes she can succeed where others have failed - in reducing the huge gap between girls and boys studying so-called Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths. To do this, she has set up Stemettes, which she runs when she isn't in her day job at a global investment bank. She was one of just three girls in a class of 70 studying maths and computer science at university. "At the time I wasn't that bothered, I just thought it was part and parcel of studying computer science," she says. "But then last year I spoke at a conference and I heard that the numbers of women in technology was in decline and I thought, 'That isn't right.' "Technology is at the forefront of the economy and women have a vital role to play. When my daughters are born I don't want them to feel like the odd ones out." The UK has a massive skills gap. Only 17% of the UK's tech jobs are held by women. In Stem subjects generally women make up just 13% of the workforce. In engineering women fare even worse, taking up just 8% of the jobs. So where does it all go wrong? At secondary school, girls are as likely as boys to study Stem subjects, at least up to GCSE, but for A-levels and beyond, female representation drops off dramatically. And among girls who carry on and study science at university, two out of three don't go on to Stem-related careers. The reasons for the drop-off in interest are multiple, thinks Ms Imafidon. "Some schools, often girl-only schools, simply don't offer ICT [information and communications technology] at A-level and the girls wanting to do it have to go to a nearby boys school to learn it," she says. "In other schools, computer science often clashes with things like drama or music, meaning the girls can't do both. If every other girl is doing drama, you'd want to be in a class with all your friends rather than take the difficult route and do computer science." Girls are very aware that their choice of A-level subjects impacts what they study at university and which one they go to. It means that girls tend to choose "safe" subjects that they know they will get a good grade in, according to Ms Imafidon. "Choosing computer science is an unnecessarily tough choice and one you aren't going to make unless you are one of the stubborn girls like I was," she says. It isn't like that everywhere. Brazil punches above its weight, ranking highest overall in the representation of women in science and technology, according to a report from Women in Global Science and Technology. Much of that is down to programmes that support women in the workforce, good funding for education and research and support of female entrepreneurship. South Africa and India also score well. For Ms Imafidon, it is because ITC has a very different image and status in these countries. "In India if you go into technology, it is because you want to do well and get ahead in life. If you see a well-dressed women walking down the street, you don't ask is she a lawyer or a banker but is she working in IT," she says. The aim of Stemettes and other sister organisations is to replicate in the West what is happening in the developing world. To facilitate that, the group runs events around the country aimed at getting girls interested in technology. Girls are introduced to a range of women already working in Stem subjects and are invited to take part in events such as hackathons. "We get them making mobile apps, data visualisations, having fun," says Ms Imafidon. The fact that they can do all this surrounded by other girls makes them more confident. "Coding clubs are dominated by boys. We want to make our club as normal for girls as ballet," says Ms Imafidon. At the end of the month the group will host a hackathon in Oxford, and in November it is running an exhibition at the Crystal in London's docklands. Girls aged from seven to 22 will be invited to take a variety of workshops, including dance and science, 3D printing and one on nuclear substances. The goal of Stemettes and its sister organisations is to get the women in the Stem workforce up to 30% by 2020. When you consider that women began coding 200 years ago, it seems like a fairly realistic ambition. This week saw the annual Ada Lovelace day, which every year celebrates the achievements of the Victorian woman credited with writing the first piece of code for Charles Babbage's analytical engine. The fact that Mrs Lovelace was coding in an age when even few men were, shows that there is no inherent aptitude problem, thinks Ms Imafidon. "It isn't that girls can't do it, it is that they are choosing not to do it," she says. "She was doing it 200 years ago so we have no excuse." </body>

      <title>Crowdfunding the arts in South Africa</title>
      <description>South African musicians ask their listeners to turn investors</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24614331</url>

      <body>Money for a Monteverdi melody, and Bach for their buck. The Cape Consort is a Cape Town-based ensemble in search of investment to help them put on a concert. As with many struggling artists, they are in need of funding. After all, "musicians need to pay rent and eat just like everybody else," says Hans Huyssen, cellist with the group. The Cape Consort has turned to crowdfunding, an online collective fundraising approach. They achieved their target amount of 15,000 rand ($1,525; £945), raising 60% of that in just six days. The funds raised allowed them to put on a series of concerts, with the last one having just taken place on Sunday in Cape Town. Instead of approaching one investor to ask for capital, crowdfunding is an online platform that allows small initiatives like Cape Consort to post proposals on a dedicated website and ask the world wide crowd for funding. Even though the concept of collective fundraising is not new, (New York-based Kickstarter is widely credited with pioneering online crowdfunding in 2009), one crowdfunding website in South Africa is using it in an unusual way, to get funding for the arts. Patrick Schofield is the founder of Thundafund, described as a "crowdfunding cafe" for African innovators and creative entrepreneurs. It provides both a crowdfunding platform together with mentorship. "I think the funding is one thing but people need the supporting environment to help them realise their idea and to make it successful, and that's what we bring together," he says. Thundafund has been up and running for over four months, and 80% of the projects that have gone on the website have gained funding. Michelle Constant is the chief executive of Business and Arts South Africa (BASA), a public-private partnership that aims to build partnerships between business and the arts. "It's simplistic to assume that the private sector and the government can do all the funding of the arts as we move forward into the future," she says. Funding arts projects will always take a backseat to issues such as reducing poverty and improving healthcare and housing - issues which are key in Africa. "So if there is an opportunity where people who in their individual capacity can give [to the arts], it's exciting," says Ms Constant. But crowdfunding for the arts is about more than just funding a specific project - it's also about tapping into a more engaged audience by using technology as a platform. Mr Schofield compares the power of crowdfunding as a vehicle for raising money to the power of social media when it comes to current affairs. "When you talk to 100 people and say, 'look, I'm not asking you for a huge amount, instead I'm going to say back me with a small amount and together we'll all make it happen' - in many ways it's the same way as news is fed through Twitter. "There's 100 people talking about the event and it's often so much more powerful than one voice and they will funnel 100 people together to a larger channel." With crowdfunding, as with any investment, you get a return. However, rather than a financial return, what you're most likely to gain is a creative product, be it a book, play, performance or CD. On the other hand, unlike with a financial product, you know exactly what you're getting for your money as those who are doing the crowdfunding have to be upfront about what they can offer. For instance, for an investment of 50 rand the Cape Consort will put your name on their website. Meanwhile, for 20,000 rand you can get four tickets to one of their performances, signed programmes, and an exclusive private concert among other things. But can online crowdfunding work in a country where so many people don't have access to the internet? Media analyst Arthur Goldstuck says it is already working, adding that while the digital divide may not be an issue, there are challenges. "Those who have the means to participate in crowdfunding wouldn't really be the 'have-nots', so in South Africa the 'haves' have relatively good internet access… so that really isn't the constraint," Mr Goldstuck says. "The constraint is more around trust of the crowdfunding model and the essence of crowdfunding is you have to hype up your product and create enthusiasm for it and that's not how investors like to be drawn into an investment opportunity." Thundafund's Patrick Schofield also believes that the crowdfunding model can be an ideological tool that can bring about change. He calls crowdfunding "funds with benefits" and says it "allows us to make the world as we would like it". If the audience supports an idea online, the idea will come to life; if there's no support, there's no execution. This allows an interactive audience to dictate what they want to see in the creative arts arena by supporting it. As Hans Huyssen, from the Cape Consort, says, "music is not something that relies on musicians only. "I mean we can rehearse and perform, but unless somebody hears what we do, the musical experience doesn't happen. "So you're involving your audience not only in concert, but also in advance, and to make them aware that they have a responsibility for the music to happen." </body>

      <body>The Grangemouth petrochemical plant near Falkirk is to stay open after a new deal was struck with workers. Staff were told in a mass meeting at 11:00 that the decision to close the site would be reversed. Operator Ineos announced on Wednesday that the plant was to shut, with the loss of 800 jobs, after union members rejected a survival plan. But on Friday, Ineos said it would reopen the plant and the neighbouring oil refinery "with immediate effect". The news was welcomed by the Unite union and political leaders. The company said the move had followed a "dramatic U-turn" by Unite and its "belated recognition" that the company's survival plan was the only way to ensure Grangemouth's long-term future. It added that Unite had agreed to taking no strike action for three years, moving to a "modern" pension scheme and accepting a three-year pay freeze. Ineos also confirmed it would invest a further £300m in the site's long-term future. The company's announcement was greeted by huge cheers from the workforce, who had gathered at the plant to be told of the company's decision. Unite Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said: "Relief will ring right round the Grangemouth community, and across Scotland today. "Hundreds of jobs that would have been lost can now be saved and £300m will be invested into the plant." First Minister Alex Salmond described the announcement as a "tremendous fillip for the workforce and the whole Grangemouth community, following what could have been a potential disaster". He said it had been "a great team effort from all concerned", including the unions and workforce, the management and governments. "I am delighted that people have rallied round to protect these jobs, and now we can all agree that Grangemouth has an outstanding future," he added. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael also welcomed the announcement, saying that it was "the news that we all wanted". "The staff and their families have been through a very stressful and uncertain time," he said. "They have been through a hell of a week and I hope they have a much better weekend as a result of today's announcement." Mr Carmichael added: "They can look to the future with an optimism which was absent earlier in the week." Ineos' future plans include investing a further £300m in the site. Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean said: "It is a huge investment and that investment was only rightly to be done if we had a long-term sustainable base. "What we have now done is given the chemicals business another 15 to 20 years on the back of new raw materials, new contracts and significant investment." Mr MacLean would not dismiss the prospect of redundancies, but said they would be "very limited". He also denied that the company had demanded any additional concessions from the union. The company said the Scottish government had indicated it would support its application for a £9m grant to help finance a gas terminal, while the UK government had given "pre-qualification approval" for a £125m loan guarantee facility. Ineos founder and chairman Jim Ratcliffe said it was "a victory for common sense". He told the BBC that the Grangemouth complex "should have a life for many years to come, as long as we can get this gas terminal built and we can sign up gas contracts and bring gas in from America". The company has indicated that 2,000 contractors it laid off after shutting down the complex would be re-hired to support investment in its survival plan. Falkirk Council, which had planned to set up a task force to respond to the threatened closure, said the Ineos announcement was "the best possible outcome for all concerned". Council leader Craig Martin added: "There has been a tremendous effort behind the scenes to secure the plant's future involving UK and Scottish governments and Falkirk Council, working together to ensure the plant's survival. "This partnership approach has paid off and a more stable and positive future for the workforce has been delivered." The closure move came after workers rejected a deal which would have changed their pay and pensions. Ministers and Unite were involved in top-level talks on Thursday to try to save the site and a fresh offer was made by unions to the company. </body>

      <title>Firefighters to stage more strikes</title>
      <description>Firefighters in England and Wales are to strike on 1 and 4 November in a row over pensions, the Fire Brigades Union says.</description>

      <body>Firefighters in England and Wales are to stage two more strikes in the run-up to bonfire night in a row over pensions, the Fire Brigades Union says. The government wants firefighters to work up to 60 but the union says this is too old to be fighting fires. FBU members are due to walk out on 1 November from 18:30 to 23:00 GMT and on 4 November from 06:00 to 08:00 GMT. In the first round of action last month, 32,000 union members in England and Wales walked out, the FBU said. A second strike was called off earlier this month after progress was made during talks. The FBU postponed the five-hour strike saying that the government and fire employers had shifted their position and recognised that firefighters faced losing their jobs and a "large chunk" of their pensions under new changes imposed in April. However, the FBU now says the government and fire employers have failed to offer any firm guarantees on jobs or pensions. FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said: "The Westminster government has created this mess, but it is refusing to clear it up. "It now recognises the problem but it won't provide the legal and financial guarantees firefighters need to ensure they have a job and an unreduced pension in the future. "Firefighters face the sack towards the end of their career and the loss of their pension. That can't be right. "The employers promised to tackle the issue of firefighters facing the sack for failing fitness tests last week, only to say they can't offer any guarantees this week. "That is simply not the way to run a public service. "The government is now making threats to withdraw some of the other concessions they have made this year." London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson said it was prepared to deal with further strikes and would have 27 fire engines based at strategic points across the capital. "The evening strike date falls on the Friday before bonfire night. It is just before Diwali and coincides with half-term, so people need to be really careful with fireworks and bonfires," he said. During the first strike on 25 September, contingency plans at the 46 fire services in England and three in Wales included using part-time and volunteer firefighters, calling in non-union fire crews and bringing in private contractors. The armed forces had a back-up role and in the event of a major incident, union members could have returned to work. No major incidents were reported during the four-hour strike which was the first national walkout for a decade. </body>

      <title>Serco chief executive stands down</title>
      <description>The boss of security firm Serco resigns after accusations of overcharging the government tens of millions of pounds for electronic tags for criminals.</description>

      <body>The chief executive at Serco, a security firm at the centre of an overcharging scandal, has resigned. Outgoing boss Chris Hyman said the best way for the company to move forward "is for me to step back". Serco is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) after claims it had overcharged the government by "tens of millions" of pounds for electronic tags for criminals. The government welcomed the news, describing it as a "positive move". In July, Justice Secretary Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said an audit had revealed a "significant anomaly in the billing practices" of both Serco and G4S. Mr Grayling said that since 2005, the companies had in some cases been charging for tagging offenders who were in prison, had left the country or were even dead. In September, the government handed information to the SFO for their assessment. On Friday, Serco announced plans to reorganise the company. The firm said it would split the government work into a separate business that could be more closely monitored. A government statement said it would "take full account of all the changes Serco have made today". "Whilst it is early days in their programme of renewal, this is a positive move by Serco and a step forward." The statement added that its review of government contracts, announced in July by the Justice Secretary, was continuing and would "ensure government's contractual arrangements are robust and taxpayers' money is spent responsibly, in a vibrant, competitive market for public services". Shares in Serco were up 2.8% after the news. Mr Hyman said he had "always put the interests of Serco first", adding that it was important the relationship with the government was rebuilt. He said: "I have been fortunate enough to have had the privilege of working at a great company with extremely talented people. I wish everyone at Serco the very best for the future." No new contracts are being awarded to either of the firms until the audit is completed, the government said in September. The head of G4S, Richard Morris, stepped down on Thursday. </body>

      <title>UK growth fastest for three years</title>
      <description>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show, the fastest growth since 2010.</description>

      <body>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show. The Office for National Statistics said there had been a "fairly strong" performance across all sectors. The data builds on a 0.7% GDP rise in the April-June period and is the best quarterly performance since 2010. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne tweeted: "This shows that Britain's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity." Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the figures "show that we are firmly on the road to economic recovery". The ONS data for construction was up 2.5% over the quarter, the second successive quarter of growth after a volatile performance over the past year. The BBC's chief economics correspondent, Hugh Pym, said: "This could signal that a recovery in that sector is really under way." House-builders have been buoyed by the Government's Help to Buy scheme, which recently launched a new phase offering mortgage guarantees. The ONS said that production grew by 0.5%, though this remains 12.8% off its 2008 level, while within this, manufacturing improved 0.9% in the third quarter. The services sector, which represents three-quarters of economic output, grew by 0.7%. Output from services is now above its pre-crisis peak in the first quarter of 2008. Friday's figure is the first estimate, and could be revised up or down in subsequent months. Mr Osborne told the BBC: "It shows that we are on the path to prosperity. Lots of risks remain, so we have to stick with the economic plan that has got us this far. "What's encouraging about these figures is that it's not just services that are growing. Construction is growing and manufacturing is growing." Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: "After three damaging years of flatlining, it's both welcome and long overdue that our economy is growing again. "But for millions of people across the country still seeing prices rising faster than their wages, this is no recovery at all." Despite the further evidence that recovery is gaining hold, some economists remain cautious. The Institute of Directors' chief economist Graeme Leach said: "The outlook looks better than at any time since the onset of the financial crisis. Indeed, our members have more confidence in the economy than at any time since 2008. "However, strong headwinds remain and the annual growth rate year on year is nothing to get too excited about yet. Though inflationary pressures are likely to remain benign, debt and inflation are rising faster than earnings. "By far the biggest challenges remain on the supply side, not the demand side. Supply side constraints mean that the current growth spurt is unlikely to extend beyond next year. "This stage of our economic recovery is likely to be short and sweet, instead of long and strong." The director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, John Longworth, said: "This is the highest quarterly increase we've seen in three years, so the economy is clearly moving in the right direction. "But we are still behind a number of advanced economies, such as the US and Germany, that have managed to recover the output lost during the economic downturn. "Much more needs to be done to transform our economy from being good to being really great." Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said the figures confirmed the UK was enjoying "a period of healthy and well-balanced growth". He said it was likely that the UK recorded the fastest quarterly growth rate within the G7 countries in the third quarter. But he added that a squeeze on real incomes as wage growth lagged behind inflation, together with the fiscal squeeze and a stagnant eurozone, were likely to prevent recovery gathering much more pace. It echoed remarks by Bank of England governor Mark Carney on Thursday evening, when he said in a speech that the rate of growth was "towards the top end of the advanced economies", but "coming from a very very low base". </body>

      <body>A second letter bomb addressed to a serving senior police officer has been discovered at a mail sorting office in Northern Ireland. The package was found at a Royal Mail depot in Lisburn, County Antrim. It comes hours after a device in a package addressed to the PSNI chief constable was intercepted at a sorting office in north Belfast. Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr said it was thought that dissident republicans were behind both incidents. He also blamed dissidents for pipe bomb attacks on police vehicles in Londonderry and the outskirts of Belfast over the last three days. "All four, along with other attacks this months, have been designed to kill police officers," he told a press conference on Friday. "We are very lucky we are not dealing with a fatality this morning." An Army bomb team dealt with the device at Mallusk, north Belfast, early on Friday. It had been addressed to Matt Baggott at police headquarters in Knock, east Belfast. Later, a delivery office at Linenhall Street, Lisburn, was evacuated following the discovery of a suspicious object. The police said that both packages contained a viable device. Justice Minister David Ford said of the first device: "Those who sent this device have no concern whatsoever for the staff at the Mallusk sorting office, whose vigilance is to be commended." Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said the Mallusk attack was "callous and reckless". "Those responsible for this device have almost no support and have demonstrated a blatant disregard for the safety of those who could have been injured," she said. "The chief constable undertakes a challenging role in delivering community policing in a difficult environment." A spokeswoman for Royal Mail said: "The Northern Ireland mail centre at Mallusk was evacuated overnight due to a suspect package. "Unfortunately there will be an effect on deliveries today and we apologise for any inconvenience this may cause." Police have appealed for the public to be vigilant and report anything that looks suspicious. </body>

      <title>Two women's open prisons to close</title>
      <description>The Ministry of Justice announces the closure of Askham Grange and East Sutton Park women's open prisons.</description>

      <body>Two women's prisons are to close, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has announced. Askham Grange in Yorkshire and East Sutton Park in Kent are open prisons. The MoJ said it would ensure there were enough female prison places by refurbishing Eastwood Park and Foston Hall prisons and modifying buildings at Drake Hall. It comes as the MoJ announced plans for female prisoners to serve their sentences nearer to home. The MoJ says it wants female inmates to maintain family relationships, and to improve their job prospects before leaving jail. The reforms, announced by Lord McNally, the minister for female offenders, will makes women's jails so-called "resettlement prisons" intended to locate women close to home and help re-integrate them into society. As well as Askham Grange and East Sutton Park, the mother and baby unit at Holloway Prison will also be closed "due to under-occupancy", the MoJ said. The MoJ said "any demand will be met by the nearby modern, purpose-built unit at HMP Bronzefield". As of 18 October there were 101 prisoners at Askham Grange and 92 at East Sutton Park. The MoJ said the planned changes would result in a "small average reduction in distance" that women prisoners are from home. But BBC correspondent Danny Shaw said because of the latest closures, the fact there were still no jails for women in Wales and the conversion of Downview Prison to a men's prison, the resulting lack of spare room in the system made it hard to see the changes making any real difference. The planned closures will bring the number of prisons that have been closed or are planned to close to 21 since the coalition came to power in 2010. The female prison population on 30 June was 3,853, compared to 4,267 on 30 June 2010. The total prison population and detainees in immigration removal centres in England and Wales increased by 248 in the past week to 85,235. It means the number of spare places in jails in England and Wales has fallen to 811 from 841 last week. The announcements about women's prisons come after MPs accused ministers of ignoring female prisoners. The Justice Select Committee said in July that the government's probation reforms had been designed with "male offenders in mind" and treated women as "an afterthought". Lord McNally said that he wanted to end female reoffending for good. "When a female offender walks out of the prison gates, I want to make sure she never returns," he said. "Keeping female prisoners as close as possible to their homes, and importantly their children, is vital if we are to help them break the pernicious cycle of re-offending. "And providing at least a year of support in the community - alongside the means to find employment on release - will give them the best possible chance to live productive, law-abiding lives." Lord McNally also announced plans to pilot an "open unit" next year at HMP Styal, a jail in Cheshire for women and young offenders. The Ministry of Justice said the prison was chosen because of the good work it already does "helping women into jobs". One inmate, Stella, said serving her sentence at the jail allowed her to gain qualifications and be nearer to her family. "It's really important to keep the bond with the child. That's the hardest thing about being in jail - being separated from your child." The MoJ said it was considering opening a "commercial-run business" at Styal to provide training and employment opportunities for the women. It said similar ventures in Cardiff and Surrey's High Down men's prisons, which have restaurants run by prisoners and open to the public, had been a success. But Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: "Trying to improve women's imprisonment would be a waste when the best way to reduce women's offending is to invest in treatment for addictions, mental healthcare, training for work and safe housing away from domestic violence and abuse." The government says it acknowledges many women who go on to commit crime are themselves victims of domestic and sexual violence. It points to statistics suggesting 53% reported being abused as children, while 49% suffer from anxiety and depression. The MoJ says it wants to create new "personality disorder treatment services" for female prisoners by working with the NHS. Labour called on the government to avoid custodial sentences for "low-level offences". "The public want confidence that the criminal justice system is effectively punishing and reforming all those found guilty of committing crimes," said shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan. "But this government must do much more to stop women offending in the first place." He added: "With only a small number of scattered women's prisons, the concept of local resettlement is almost meaningless." </body>

      <title>Prince Charles 'prison' claim denied</title>
      <description>Clarence House denies reports that the Prince of Wales believes becoming king will be a form of prison.</description>

      <body>Clarence House has denied reports that the Prince of Wales believes becoming king will be a form of prison. A report in Time magazine quoted an unnamed official saying how Prince Charles is worried he will not achieve ambitions linked to his interests before "the prison shades" close. Time spoke to 50 of the prince's friends and associates for the article. It is not known whether the widely-reported comment was made by a current or former member of royal staff. A Clarence House spokesman said: "This is not the Prince of Wales's view and should not be attributed to him as he did not say these words. "The prince has dutifully supported the Queen all his life and his official duties and charitable work have always run in parallel." Catherine Mayer, who wrote the article for Time magazine, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that "part of a quote" had been "taken out of context" by other news organisations. "The thing that I find funny about that is, of course, one of the reasons I wanted to profile the prince is that I thought there was an extraordinary gap between who he was and what he did and how he was portrayed... in the British press. "So, to see some of what I hoped was sort of balanced and carefully calibrated somewhat sexed up doesn't surprise me at all." She said the term "prison shades" referred to concern among the prince's household that now the prince was taking on more of the Queen's duties "there's a big impact on what the Prince of Wales actually does already, in terms of time, so the reference was to his dwindling lack of time". She added: "He is absolutely not saying he doesn't want to be king and nobody in his household is saying that." For decades, as heir to the throne, the Prince of Wales has founded charities and spoken out on many issues. In the coming years, he will have to do more of his mother's work as she, now 87, does less. Next month, he will represent the Queen at a Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Sri Lanka. The Time profile said the prince took on extra royal duties "joylessly" and, far from "itching to assume the crown", he was already feeling its weight and worrying about its impact on his current role. Prince Charles, who does not comment on his accession, was quoted as saying he had always had this "extraordinary feeling" of "wanting to heal and make things better". Ms Mayer told Today that "the public image of him as a man who has sat there sort of cantankerously waiting for his mother to pop off so he can become king is about as far from the truth as it's possible to imagine". In the article, Ms Mayer said the prince sat down with the magazine "to discuss his hopes - and profound concerns - for the future". The interview was published as official photographs for the christening of Prince George were released. They showed the Queen with three future kings - the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge, and Prince George. It was the first such image since the christening of the future Edward VIII in 1894, with his father George V, grandfather Edward VII and great-grandmother Queen Victoria. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall will tour India before the Commonwealth summit. Commonwealth leaders meet every two years and the Queen has attended every one since 1973. </body>

      <body>The chair of governors of the under-fire Al-Madinah Muslim free school has announced she is stepping down. Ofsted inspectors had described the school in Derby as "dysfunctional" and rated it inadequate in every category. The inspection had been brought forward by the agency after fears were raised about teaching standards. Shazia Parveen said she would step down at the "end of a period of transition" and acknowledged the weaknesses identified by Ofsted. In a statement, she said: "The future of our children starts now." The Ofsted report, published on 17 October, said the school required special measures and that the teachers were inexperienced and had not been provided with proper training. Al-Madinah Education Trust said it accepted the report and would use it to move forward. Ms Parveen said in her statement: "Over the last few years, I have sacrificed my own time, family and health for this noble cause - to help educate the children of our communities. "The future of our children starts now. Much has been said about our school. We, the governing body, have tried our best. "We acknowledge the weaknesses within our school and have taken the Department for Education (DfE) recommendations very seriously. "I plan to step down from my position as chair of the governing body as soon as the transition is over and this is clearly for the best interests of our children. "In conclusion, we are ready to learn from our mistakes but not willing to fail our students." A Dfe spokesman said: "We were already investigating this school before allegations became public. We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection." Labour's shadow schools minister Kevin Brennan MP said following reports of Ms Parveen's resignation: "Another day, another episode in David Cameron's flailing flagship education programme. "Al-Madinah is a symbol of all that is wrong with Cameron's free schools. "Labour has long warned of the dangers: a lack of oversight, allowing unqualified teachers to teach on a permanent basis, and spending on free schools ahead of addressing the chronic shortages in primary school places." Mr Cameron had said the Derby school should not be used "as a stick with which to beat the whole free school movement". He added there were many free schools that had on average more outstanding and good ratings than established schools. The Ofsted report followed a letter to the Trust on 8 October by Education Minster Lord Nash that laid out 17 issues. These included forcing female teachers to cover their hair and failing to carry out background checks on staff. He said funding would be pulled if urgent steps had not been taken within seven days. However, the trustees now have to provide an action plan to show how fit they are to run the school, and how it will improve, by 1 November. </body>

      <title>Yacht crash Navy officer guilty</title>
      <description>A Royal Navy officer who was skippering a racing yacht that hit an oil tanker in the Solent is found guilty of contravening maritime regulations.</description>

      <body>A Royal Navy officer who was skippering a racing yacht that hit an oil tanker in the Solent has been found guilty of contravening maritime regulations. The Atalanta of Chester, belonging to Lt Roland Wilson, of Stanley, Perthshire, collided with the 260m-long Hanne Knutsen during Cowes Week 2011. The 32-year-old was convicted at Southampton Magistrates' Court of impeding the passage of a vessel. He was also found guilty of failing to keep a proper lookout. Mr Wilson, who was a serving Royal Navy officer at the time but is now a lieutenant in the reserves, had seen the tanker from five miles (8km) away, the court heard. It had been making its way to Fawley oil refinery. Wilson had told the court the ship had signalled to turn but never did, describing its manoeuvre as "unexpected". District Judge Anthony Callaway said he took the wrong decision in continuing towards the path of the tanker and not taking evasive action. The moment of impact was filmed and the video posted on YouTube, where it was watched more than 924,000 times. Mr Callaway said: "Fortuitous it was that there was no loss of life. The potential for even greater and tragic consequence is, in my judgement, apparent. "This was a serious yacht crewed by serious people in a regatta for a serious purpose. It was well equipped in terms of experience and ability to deal with any situation. "This was not some Saturday afternoon jaunt by some inadequate vessel crewed by inexperienced, clueless and foolhardy people who frankly have no business being on the water at all. "The yacht took a decision, and as I find the wrong decision, to sail towards the problem into the path of the tanker across a narrow channel. It should have kept clear and in the worst event used her engine." The judge said conditions in the Solent were crowded due to Cowes Week but the yacht's crew were experienced enough to perform the "difficult manoeuvre". He added: "The fact it didn't do so was the product not of a lack of skill, but the product of the wrong decision at the wrong time, for which the skipper, Roland Wilson, must take responsibility." Mr Wilson was ordered to pay a fine of £3,000, and costs of more than £100,000. The yacht, which had a crew of eight, suffered a damaged mast and its sail almost became entangled in the anchor of the Hanne Knutsen. One crew member suffered minor head injuries and another abandoned ship after the collision with the 120,000-tonne tanker. Mr Wilson was convicted of one count of failing to keep a proper lookout and two counts of impeding the passage of a tanker in a restricted channel. </body>

      <title>Gurkhas' hunger strike over pensions</title>
      <description>A group of about 60 Gurkhas living in the UK is preparing to go on hunger strike over demands for equal pension rights.</description>

      <body>Gurkhas angered by what they say is the government's refusal to give them equal pension rights are beginning a hunger strike later. About 60 Gurkhas from Reading say they will starve themselves to death unless there is a change to their pensions. The MoD said the Gurkhas' conditions of service had "always been fair". Two Gurkhas will start a hunger strike at 13:00 BST, 24-hours later another two will take over, building to a mass hunger strike on 7 November. In April, Gurkha veterans from across the south went to Westminster to plea for equal pension rights in line with the rest of the military. About 25,000 Gurkhas who retired before 1997 get about a third of the pension received by their British former comrades. Gurkha veteran Gyanraj Rai said: "I was already prepared to die for Britain and I have been campaigning for the last 15 years at my own expense. "We don't have any more money to do a campaign - now the only thing left is my body." In a statement, the Ministry of Defence said: "Gurkha terms and conditions of service have always been fair. "They have reflected the environment that the Gurkhas were in, and they have changed and improved over time to reflect the Gurkhas' changing circumstances." There are 10,000 Gurkha veterans living in the UK, many of them in Reading and Aldershot. In 2009, the government allowed former Gurkha soldiers who had retired before 1997 to settle in the UK following a high-profile campaign led by actress Joanna Lumley. </body>

      <body>An al-Shabab commander who was the target of a recent abortive US special forces raid in Somalia had spent time in the UK, the BBC has learned. Abdukadir Mohamed Abdukadir, widely known as Ikrima, has been linked to alleged terror plots in Kenya. Friends have told the BBC that he came to the UK in 2007 and spent time in London, before moving to Somalia the following year. US Navy Seals failed in an attempt to capture him on 5 October. The raid followed an attack on the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi, Kenya, on 21 September that lasted four days and left at least 67 people dead. Al-Shabab has claimed responsibility for the siege. The BBC's East Africa correspondent Gabriel Gatehouse said it was not clear what role, if any, Ikrima had played in that attack. He is thought to be a recruiter of foreign fighters, and a key link between al-Shabab in Somalia, and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based in Yemen, our correspondent added. In 2004 he travelled to Norway, where he unsuccessfully sought asylum. The BBC has discovered that in early 2007 he came to Britain and spent time in London, before moving back to Somalia. Leaked Kenyan intelligence documents have linked him to Samantha Lewthwaite - the British widow of one of the 7/7 suicide attackers on the London transport system in 2005. An alleged plot to bomb targets in Kenya was foiled, police say, when they raided a number of addresses in Mombasa in December 2011. Ms Lewthwaite slipped away, her whereabouts are unknown. Our correspondent said the Kenyan authorities believe apprehending Ms Lewthwaite and Ikrima could help prevent future attacks similar to the one at Westgate. Meanwhile, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon has said an extra 4,500 troops are needed by the UN-backed African Union force (Amisom) fighting al-Shabab in Somalia. Mr Ban said in a report to the UN Security Council that recent military advances against al-Shabab could be reversed and there was a danger of more Westgate-style attacks if the 18,000-strong force was not bolstered. Al-Shabab said it had staged the attack on Westgate in response to Kenya's army joining Amisom and carrying out operations on Somali territory. The UN chief said that in addition to a troop surge, which would have to be paid for by richer UN member states, the African force also needed military attack helicopters. He appealed to both African and non-African countries to supply these. The BBC's international development correspondent Mark Doyle said the African Union had requested a boost of more than 6,000 troops, so concern had been expressed by African diplomats at the lower figure recommended by Mr Ban. In the past two years, Amisom has made significant advances against al-Shabab, pushing their main armed units out of several cities including the capital, Mogadishu, and the key southern port of Kismayo. But the militants still control many smaller towns and large rural areas of southern Somalia. </body>

      <description>Scottish Labour's Cara Hilton wins the Dunfermline by-election for the Scottish Parliament, taking the seat from the SNP.</description>

      <body>Labour has won the Scottish Parliament by-election in Dunfermline, after beating the SNP by almost 3,000 votes. The victory represented a gain from the SNP, who took the seat in the 2011 Holyrood election. The by-election was caused by the resignation of sitting MSP Bill Walker, who was thrown out of the SNP and jailed for domestic abuse. Cara Hilton, the parliament's newest MSP, said the people of Dunfermline "deserved better". The SNP won Dunfermline as part of its landslide election win in 2011 with a majority of just 590 votes, but was not able to hold on. In the end, Labour took the seat with a majority of 2,873 - a 7% swing from the SNP. The Liberal Democrats came third in the contest, with the Conservatives in fourth place. Ms Hilton said: "After the disgrace of Bill Walker, Dunfermline deserves better and I will ensure that we will be better - far better than what went before." And ahead of the SNP administration's independence referendum next year, she added: "We need a Scottish government that will address the needs of Scots, not one that will simply make promises about what will happen after 2016. "Today Dunfermline has sent a message to Bute House and Alex Salmond: it's time for you to focus on the real priorities of Scots, not your constitutional obsession." The by-election campaign centred on contentious local issues, including proposed school closures, while the SNP focused on its national policies such as the council tax freeze and the decision to remove the tolls on the nearby Forth Road Bridge. Despite the result, SNP candidate Shirley-Anne Somerville said she was proud of the campaign she fought. "We've run a positive campaign trying to support local parents in their schools and I hope we can come together, all of us in the party, to make sure those three schools in the Dunfermline constituency stay open," she said. The Liberal Democrats saw their vote drop by 8% on the night. Candidate Susan Leslie said: "I think it has been a victory for women in politics in Scotland that four women stood in this by-election and fought positive campaigns on the issues for Dunfermline." Scottish Conservative candidate James Reekie - whose party saw a 1% increase in its vote - added: "When the people of Dunfermline are faced with the dilemma of Labour and the SNP, they chose the Conservatives." Turnout in the by-election was 42.65%. </body>

      <title>3D printer 'gun parts' found in raid</title>
      <description>A 3D printer and suspected "homemade" gun components seized during police raids in Manchester are being examined.</description>

      <body>A 3D printer and suspected "homemade" gun components seized during police raids in Manchester are being examined. Detectives initially said the parts were a "plastic magazine and trigger" which could make a "viable" gun. But the man held on suspicion of making gunpowder has told the BBC they are actually sections of a 3D printer. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) now say they "cannot categorically say" whether they had recovered the component parts for a gun. A force spokesman said if the tests showed the parts could make a functioning weapon it would be the "first ever seizure of this kind in the UK". Det Insp Chris Mossop, of GMP, said: "If what we have seized is proven to be viable components capable of constructing a genuine firearm, then it demonstrates that organised crime groups are acquiring technology that can be bought on the high street to produce the next generation of weapons. "In theory, the technology essentially allows offenders to produce their own guns in the privacy of their own home, which they can then supply to the criminal gangs who are causing such misery in our communities. "Because they are also plastic and can avoid X-ray detection, it makes them easy to conceal and smuggle." He added: "If what we have seized today can, as we suspect, be used to make a genuine firearm then today will be an important milestone in the fight against this next generation of homemade weapons." The BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said the discovery was "almost inevitable" because of the relatively few firearms in circulation. "The worst-case-scenario would be a cheap and 100% reliable device that could be made overnight and then destroyed after just one use, disposing of crucial evidence to pin to a suspect," he added. The raid was part of GMP's Operation Challenger, which aims to "dismantle" organised criminal gangs. Counterfeit goods worth £2m, more than £330,000 of drugs and £25,000 cash, have been seized in a crackdown. 3D printing technology works by building up layer upon layer of material - typically plastic - to create complex solid objects. Desktop 3D printers can be bought on the high street for less than £1,000, but prices can be as high as £10,000. The world's first gun made with 3D printer technology was successfully fired in the US in May. The group that created the firearm, Defense Distributed, said it planned to make the blueprints available online. Defense Distributed is headed by Cody Wilson, a 25-year-old law student at the University of Texas, who defended making the design available by saying: "I'm seeing a world where technology says you can pretty much be able to have whatever you want. "It's not up to the political players anymore." At the time, Europe's law enforcement agency Europol said it feared criminals would follow suit as the technology became cheaper and more user friendly. </body>

      <description>Five Respect councillors in Bradford fully resign from the party, accusing George Galloway of defamation and lack of transparency.</description>

      <body>The Respect party no longer has any councillors in Bradford after they all resigned, accusing George Galloway of defamation and lack of transparency. The five councillors, elected in a surge of local support for Respect last year, temporarily resigned in August but have now left the party altogether. Two were suspended over criticism of Mr Galloway's plans to stand for London mayor, and he questioned their loyalty. Respect said the councillors' conduct had been "unacceptable". The five councillors are Alyas Karmani, Ruqaya Collector, Faisal Khan, Ishtiaq Ahmed and Mohammed Shabbir. Speaking to The Guardian in August, they criticised Mr Galloway, saying he should step down as an MP if he wanted to fight in the 2016 London mayoral election. In response to the article, Mr Galloway accused the councillors of "destabilising the party" and "conniving with the Khans", in reference to his former aide Aisha Ali Khan and her police officer husband Det Insp Afiz Khan who have been charged with misconduct offences. Mr Ahmed and Mr Shabbir were suspended by national party managers the same day. In a statement issued on Friday the councillors said they had been in discussions with senior party officials over the past two months to address their concerns about the "unwarranted" suspensions, "defamatory" statements made about them and a "failure to develop transparent operations structures and procedures to enable the party to work effectively in Bradford". They said: "Regrettably, these discussions have failed to find common ground as senior Respect officials have shown a disregard to address our legitimate grievances and we have been unable to resolve our issues of difference. "After much deliberation this has left our group no choice but to fully resign from the Respect party with immediate effect." The councillors said they would continue as independents for the remainder of their terms. Respect said talks between party officials and the councillors had "foundered on the unacceptable conduct of the councillors", who it accused of regularly speaking out against the party. It said Mr Ahmed and Mr Shabir were expelled by the party on Thursday, the day the councillors say they informed officials of their resignation. A Respect statement said the councillors' visibility and impact in the council chamber "has been virtually non-existent". "If they had a shred of principle they would now resign their council seats and stand again in their new colours. Or will they instead continue to draw thousands of pounds of public money until they are removed by the voters?" </body>

      <body>A major search has been launched after a passenger was reported missing from a ferry in the Northern Isles. The passenger - believed to be in his 40s - was thought to have gone overboard from the NorthLink ferry Hrossey, which was sailing from Kirkwall in Orkney to Lerwick in Shetland. The area being searched is to the east of the island of Sanday in Orkney. Three lifeboats and a coastguard helicopter were involved in the search. A fisheries protection vessel and a local fishing boat were also assisting. Ferry operator NorthLink said the captain of the Hrossey was notified of the incident at about 04:00. They said he immediately turned his vessel to begin a search for the passenger. The MV Hrossey left Kirkwall at 00:25 and had been due to arrive in Lerwick at 07:30. It had 172 passengers on board. Hrossey was later released from the search, and headed to Lerwick. </body>

      <body>A new colony of water voles has been captured on film using hidden cameras at a canal lock in Wiltshire. Ecologists from the Canal and River Trust spotted signs of the creatures during conservation works at the Caen Hill lock flight near Devizes. Laura Plenty, from the trust, said: "We decided it was a fantastic place to test our heat and motion sensitive camera to catch them in the act." The nationally-protected species is one of the UK's fastest declining mammals. Ms Plenty said the trust had been working to create the right habitat for the creatures in an attempt to reverse the decline in the water vole population. She said they knew there were some colonies on the canal near Devizes but had not been aware of this particular colony until the recent visit to Caen Hill Lock. She said they put the camera in place after "spotting a water vole latrine which is basically a big pile of droppings". "I couldn't believe it when we captured our first footage of the water vole," Ms Plenty said. "It clearly wasn't camera shy, as we managed to get further footage, with the vole even investigating the camera and knocking it over which happily lead to some fantastic shots of water voles hauling themselves out of the water. "Viewing the footage of the vole proves that this hard work has been worthwhile. "The fact that there's a new colony of voles living on the canal is the best reward we could ask for." Water voles like to live along canals and riverbanks so they can burrow to create complicated systems of underground tunnels and nesting chambers. A survey released by the Environment Agency and wildlife trusts in September, suggested that water voles had decreased by a fifth in the UK since 2011. Reasons for the declining population include habitat loss, predation by American mink and changeable weather. </body>

      <title>Surgery offer for ex-'fattest man'</title>
      <description>A US surgeon offers to remove excess skin from a British man once dubbed the world's fattest.</description>

      <body>A plastic surgeon in the US has offered to operate on a British man once dubbed the world's fattest. At his heaviest, Paul Mason weighed 70 stone (444kg) and was bed bound at his bungalow in Ipswich, Suffolk. He now weighs about 24 stone (152kg) after gastric bypass surgery in 2010 but says his life is being hampered by a huge amount of excess skin. New York-based surgeon Dr Jennifer Capla said she was willing to donate her time to help Mr Mason. In May, Mr Mason, 52, released photographs of his naked body as part of his plea for medical help. Mr Mason said he had begun trying to raise the money to pay for flights and a hospital stay in order to take advantage of Dr Capla's offer. Dr Capla told BBC Radio Suffolk she had read about Mr Mason and his weight loss in the New York Times. "He is a high-risk patient and he has a lot of medical issues that we need to sort through," she said. "However, he's a great candidate for this skin removal surgery. "He has lost over 600lbs (272kg) and he should be very functional and mobile and should be able to live his life but he's still wheelchair-bound because he has all this excess skin. "Helping him get his life back is really the goal." Dr Capla said she specialised in "post-bariatric body contouring" but that although she had treated patients who has lost up to 200lbs (90kg) she had never treated anyone who had lost as much weight as Mr Mason. "The skin is the same in terms of looseness and the areas of target so it's an area I'm very familiar with," she said. Mr Mason said he had "things in motion" to raise the money needed. "All I've got to cover is the medication, the stay in hospital and the flights," she said. Mr Mason has not been able to have the surgery on the NHS because his weight has not been stable. He said an operation to remove excess skin around his middle would make a huge difference. "I would be able to mobilise and lead a reasonably normal life, then have my arms and legs done," he said. "Five years down the road it would possibly have to be repeated because by then I should be at my goal weight and the excess skin I would have then would still need removing because of the extreme size I was in the first place." A spokesman for the NHS Ipswich and East Suffolk Clinical Commissioning Group said: "Before a patient has an operation it is important to take a balanced decision that is in the best interest of that patient. "In cases like this the NHS has a panel of people - including clinicians - who decide whether the patient should have such an operation. A patient must have a stable weight before he or she is considered." </body>

      <body>A man has been found guilty of the attempted murder of County Armagh woman Natasha McShane and her friend Stacy Jurich in Chicago three years ago. Heriberto Viramontes, 34, was convicted at Cook County Criminal Court in the US city on Thursday. The pair were attacked and robbed in the early hours of 23 April, 2010. Ms McShane, who had been attending the University of Illinois at the time of the assault, has been left with severe brain damage. Just before 18:00 local time - midnight UK time - on Thursday, her family, along with Stacy Jurich and her family, were called for the verdict. The trial lasted five days, it took three and a half hours to find Viramontes guilty on all charges. There were emotional scenes as the verdicts were delivered. Shortly afterwards, a statement written by Natasha's brother, Conor, was read out to the press by the state's attorney. "This crime against my sister has changed my life forever. It has had a devastating impact on our entire family," the statement said. Conor McShane said the family was pleased and relieved at the verdicts. But he also said that Natasha's life had been ruined by the attack. She has been left unable to talk or walk unaided. Stacy Jurich said that the time since the attack had been the most difficult in her life. "We have had a lot of support from our families, friends and complete strangers," she said. "But the last three and a half years have been the hardest time in my entire life. Not only was it a struggle for me, but it has been a struggle to face what happened to my best friend, Natasha - something I will never forget." Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez said: "Chicago is a beautiful city, it is a shame that someone like Natasha McShane, who was here to continue her schooling, someone who was visiting from Ireland, that she was not able to enjoy all the beauty that Chicago has to offer. "Instead of welcoming our visitors with an open heart, she was confronted with a baseball bat. I am very pleased that this man has been held responsible for the brutal and senseless beating of both Stacy Jurich and Natasha McShane." Viramontes faces between six and 120 years in prison. In July, his accomplice Marcy Cruz was jailed for 22 years after pleading guilty to two counts of attempted murder over the attack. </body>

      <title>Caterpillar in £7m NI investment</title>
      <description>US engineering firm Caterpillar says a £7m investment in its Northern Ireland factories will create new jobs.</description>

      <body>US engineering firm Caterpillar says a £7m investment in its Northern Ireland factories will create new jobs. The company is to begin manufacturing vehicles used in the scrap metal and forestry industries. Currently the firm only makes generators across its plants at Larne, Belfast, Springvale and Monkstown. The new operation will require 100 positions. Some will be new jobs while others will involve retraining existing staff. In September 2012, the firm cut more than 700 jobs as it moved some manufacturing to China. It later added about 200 jobs in a "shared services centre" which provides back-office support for Caterpillar's global operations. Caterpillar Northern Ireland operations director Robert Kennedy said all of its local plants would benefit from the investment. "We are very pleased to have the support of Invest NI and the Department for Employment and Learning to make this investment which will enable new work to come to Northern Ireland, providing an important addition to our existing operations. "This expansion recognises the high standard of the facilities, processes and skills in Northern Ireland." The announcement was made by the first and deputy first ministers, who are in the US on a business development trip. Peter Robinson said: "The project is especially important as it has the potential to help attract additional projects from the wider Caterpillar family. "This new project for Northern Ireland will also offer our local workforce the opportunity to develop key transferable skills that will add value to our manufacturing sector, bringing further economic benefit." Martin McGuinness said: "This £7m investment supported by a range of assistance, from both Invest NI and the Department for Employment and Learning, will ensure that Caterpillar has the support it needs to fully realise its manufacturing potential within this key area. "The 100 quality manufacturing positions required to run the operation will generate salaries in the region of £2.2m annually, ensuring that existing employees and local people have an opportunity to progress high value career development opportunities." The ministers made the announcement after meeting senior management at Caterpillar's headquarters in Peoria, Illinois. Invest Northern Ireland offered Caterpillar more than £1m to secure the project, and the Department for Employment and Learning offered £220,000 through its Assured Skills Programme. US-based Caterpillar bought over the Northern Ireland engineering firm FG Wilson - which makes diesel generator sets - in 1999. </body>

      <title>'Devastating' college cuts warning</title>
      <description>Cuts to further education budgets in Wales are "short-sighted" and could damage life-long learning, say teaching unions and charities.</description>

      <body>Cuts to further education (FE) budgets in Wales are "short-sighted" and could damage life-long learning, say teaching unions and charities. The Welsh government is proposing £44.9m of cuts in the FE sector next year and a further £42.5m the following year. The ATL teaching union said there would be a "devastating" impact. The Welsh government said it would work closely with colleges "to minimise the impact of any reductions on learning". Most of the proposed cuts will fall on post-19 further education, which is losing almost a quarter of a £160m budget. "We're talking about very positive things here, about courses which help with the difficult to reach, which help the Neets (not in education, employment or training), those who have been out of work for a long time, courses which help people to upskill and get better jobs," said Dr Phil Dixon from the ATL union. "And I think if those go, then a lot of people in the sector will be very demoralised." His concerns have been echoed by the University and College Union (UCU), which said colleges would struggle to deliver the level of services needed in Wales if the cuts went ahead. "The FE sector is a key player that should not be ignored," said a UCU spokesperson. "It provides a lifeline for many adults who want a second chance at education, enabling them to improve opportunities for themselves and therefore their children. "If reducing child poverty is a top priority for the Welsh government, the role that FE can play in this needs to be taken seriously and funded accordingly." Last year there were almost 250,000 learners in FE colleges in Wales, with three-quarters over the age of 19 and many studying part time. The colleges provide courses on a huge range of subjects including everything from basket weaving and brick laying to advanced manufacturing and engineering. Many of the courses are vocational but academic qualifications are also offered. The Welsh government's own analysis said the cuts would have a disproportionate impact on women, who are more likely to be adult learners, as well as those from an ethnic minority background. It also said it would make it more difficult for those who are out of work to re-train. The National Institute of Adult Continuing Education in Wales (NIACE) charity, said there were "wider benefits" in adult learning and now was not a time to cut the budget. "The effect of the cuts will be a reduction of the number of adult learners in Wales and NIACE Dysgu Cymru would advocate that at such a difficult time, we should be maintaining or even increasing funding for life-long learning for all sorts of reasons," said Essex Havard from NIACE. "There is a lot of research around the area of being an active learner and being a healthy adult, particularly in the area around mental health issues... adult learning can help people to get on with their lives after trauma, for example. "So these are the things we'd want to talk to the Welsh government about - about the wider benefits of adult learning, and of the wider impact of those cuts on the adult learning and life-long education budget." The Welsh government has protected provision aimed at 16-19 year olds, so post-19 further education will bear the brunt of the cuts. Around £37m is due to be cut from post-19 learning next year, a 23% reduction from its £160m budget. Responding to the criticisms about the cuts, the Welsh government said it had been "open about the stark reality" of the financial challenges being faced. "But as we work through these difficult times, it is ever more important that we focus not just on the resources that are available but how we use them and what we achieve," said a spokesperson. "We will work closely with the post-16 sector to evaluate available options and to minimise the impact of any reductions on learning. "This will be the case for any sector that may be impacted by reductions." </body>

      <body>A man wrongly convicted of murder has launched a High Court challenge over a decision not to charge a former police officer with perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Michael O'Brien and two other men spent 11 years in jail after they were wrongly found guilty of killing Cardiff newsagent Phillip Saunders, 52. Known as the Cardiff Newsagent Three, Mr O'Brien, Darren Hall and Ellis Sherwood, were jailed in 1988. They were cleared on appeal in 1999. Mr O'Brien applied for judicial review of a Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decision that there was insufficient evidence to charge retired Det Insp Stuart Lewis. The application is being heard at London's High Court by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, who is sitting with Mr Justice Irwin. Lord Thomas told Heather Williams QC, appearing for Mr O'Brien: "The key issue we have to consider is whether the decision that has been made by the CPS was one no reasonable prosecutor would have reached." Ms Williams is arguing the CPS decision was "perverse" because of a failure to take into account relevant matters and a flawed information-gathering process. Lord Thomas ruled that the press and media can report the fact that Mr O'Brien's application is being made to the court, but not the details of the case. Mr Saunders died five days after being attacked and robbed close to his home in Canton, Cardiff, in October 1987. He had returned home in his van after working at his newsagent kiosk at Cardiff bus station and suffered a fractured skull. The jailing of the Cardiff Newsagent Three for the killing is regarded as one of the country's most notorious miscarriages of justice cases. </body>

      <body>Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum is showing 14 new acquisitions in a major redisplay of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Glasgow Style works. The eight purchases and six donations add new metalwork, ceramics, glass and stained glass to the collection. They include pieces by David Gauld, Archibald Knox, Alexander Ritchie and Christopher Dresser. The redisplay also features other works from Glasgow's civic collection which have not been on show for decades. The eight purchases were made with financial support from The National Fund for Acquisitions administered through National Museums Scotland, the Art Fund and The Heritage Lottery Fund. Councillor Archie Graham, chairman of Glasgow Life, the body which runs Kelvingrove Museum, said the city had "arguably one of the finest civic collections in Europe" thanks to help from partner bodies who helped with funding. "Together we have been able to bring beautiful works by important artists, several of them born in our great city, to the millions of people who visit Kelvingrove every year," he said. "This new display provides plenty to marvel at and an opportunity to learn a little more about their influences and techniques." Glasgow Life said the new acquisitions "reveal the skills, experimentation, influences and imagination" of artists working across Britain between the 1880s and 1930s in the Glasgow Style or part of the wider Arts and Crafts movement. One of the new items on show is a stained and leaded glass panel entitled 'Music', which was designed by Glasgow Boy David Gauld. The piece was made by the Glasgow stained glass workshop of Hugh McCulloch and Company around 1891. Another new exhibit is a copper kettle by Christopher Dresser, a pioneer of the British Design Reform Movement, dating from about 1880 to 1885. This piece was made by Benham and Froud of London. </body>

      <body>A teenager who died after jumping from a ferry on New Year's Eve may have done it as a result of alcohol-fuelled bravado, a coroner says. Jordan Cobb, 16, from Plymouth, was with friends when he went into the River Tamar from the Torpoint ferry near the Cornish shore. The inquest in Plymouth heard claims it might have been over a £100 bet. Ruling accidental death, coroner Ian Arrow said Jordan made his own decision and he was sure he did not mean to die. "We can't be certain why he dived off, whether it was bravado or for some other reason. I am satisfied he certainly didn't expect to die," Mr Arrow said. Jordan had been drinking with friends in Plymouth before the group decided to head to Torpoint, the hearing was told. He was filmed on CCTV leaping into the river at about 21:15 GMT. Witnesses told the coroner the group had moved towards the front of the ferry as it approached Torpoint when Jordan said "something like 'shall I jump off?'", but the comments were not taken seriously. He then asked a friend to hold his bag, climbed on top of a barrier and dived overboard. Witnesses saw Jordan go underwater and re-emerge to begin swimming for the shore before losing sight of him. Daily searches involving the police, coastguard and the Ministry of Defence were carried out after Jordan, who went to the city's Stoke Damerel Community College, vanished. His body was found on 16 January. The inquest heard a witness statement from two girls on the Torpoint side of the river, which claimed they heard a male who was part of Jordan's group say: "It was a £100 bet ... it was supposed to be me, but Jordan jumped in." Torpoint ferries are pulled across the River Tamar on chains and are an important travel link between Plymouth, Devon and Torpoint in Cornwall. </body>

      <body>Hundreds of mourners packed a church for the funeral of a football coach who was stabbed to death. Antoin Akpom, 20, was knifed in Kent Street, Leicester, on 12 September. In a statement read out before the service began at 10:00 BST, the family said they wanted people to remember him for the "wonderful person he was". Tributes were paid to Mr Akpom by his parents, sisters and fiancée, as well as city dignitaries including the Bishop of Leicester. The family statement read: "We are here today to say farewell and lay to rest a wonderful son, a loving partner and an adoring father. "His death at the age of 20 has been a devastating blow to his family and friends but they want people to remember him for the wonderful person he was. "Someone who loved sport and music, someone who coached and mentored countless school children, someone who was an inspiration to everyone who met him. "Even in death, Antoin is bringing together and uniting so many people all around Leicester. "Many people are working hard to see that his death is not in vain and that the good work he was doing continues. This is his legacy." The two-hour long funeral started with a recording of his mother Cheryl Armatrading singing The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face before hymns were sung and tributes were paid. Also speaking were Sir Peter Soulsby, the city's mayor, and Keith Vaz, the local MP. Mr Akpom worked as a primary school teacher, volunteered as a youth team coach for Leicester Nirvana FC and had also set up a sports coaching business with his best friend Joe French. "The funeral for any person as young as Antoin is always going to be not right because it should not be happening," said Mr French. The Right Reverend Tim Stevens, Bishop of Leicester, said: "We need to encourage the many young people there, his friends and all those who have been touched by his life, that there is hope and a real purpose in building the future of our city, "Even though it is shocking and a deep injustice has been done, we don't do anything to repair that through thoughts of revenge or the creation of conflict. "We repair that through thoughts of reconciliation and I am sure that is what our families want and what those who knew Antoin will want as well." Two men have been charged with Mr Akpom's murder and are next due to appear in court in January. </body>

      <title>Russia 2018 boycott possible - Toure</title>
      <description>Black players may boycott Russia's World Cup in 2018 unless the country tackles racism in football, Yaya Toure suggests.</description>

      <body>Black players might boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia unless the country tackles racism in football, according to Manchester City's Yaya Toure. "If we aren't confident at the World Cup, coming to Russia, we don't come," the Ivorian midfielder said. Uefa is investigating Toure's complaint that he was racially abused by some CSKA fans during Wednesday's Champions League game in Moscow. The Russian club denies any racist chanting took place. CSKA, which said it was "surprised and disappointed" by Toure's allegation, will face a disciplinary hearing on 30 October. If found guilty, Uefa could force CSKA to close part of its stadium for a future game. A club statement read: "Having carefully studied the video of the game, we found no racist insults from fans of CSKA." Spokesman Michael Sanadze told BBC Radio 5 live: "We have nothing to hide, of course, and we have confirmation from the match delegate and the venue director that they themselves didn't hear anything special." But Piara Powar, executive director of European anti-discrimination body Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare) and a member of Fifa's anti-discrimination taskforce, backed Toure's stance. He said: "Yaya Toure is absolutely right in raising the spectre of African players or players of African heritage not going to the 2018 World Cup - and without them there will not be a World Cup in Russia. "I wouldn't blame them. In this era, players are the most powerful force and if all the players said they are not going there wouldn't be a World Cup, or if there was it would be meaningless." Former West Ham striker and Torquay boss Leroy Rosenior, who also works with Show Racism the Red Card, thinks players threatening to boycott Fifa's biggest tournament might prompt the organisation into taking more robust action. "I think that it's got to a point now where, when we saw the reaction of CSKA who didn't even recognise that there was a problem, people are starting to think that this isn't something that is stagnating. We're actually going backwards," he told BBC Radio 5 live. "Boycotting the World Cup, which is sanctioned by Fifa, is a threat that maybe needs to be a serious threat because you want the authorities to come up with something off the back of a threat which will actually get something positive happening." </body>

      <title>Changes agreed to European club rugby</title>
      <description>The English, French, Scottish, Welsh, Irish and Italian unions agree to change the structure of European club rugby.</description>

      <body>The English, French, Scottish, Welsh, Irish and Italian governing bodies have agreed to change the structure of European club rugby. After meetings in Dublin, they agreed on the formation of two tweaked competitions of 20 teams each as well as a change in revenue distribution. But top English and French clubs, who have proposed a breakaway competition from next season, were not present. The Anglo-French plan has been backed by the four Welsh regions. Premiership Rugby (PRL) in England and Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR) in France say they will have no involvement in the Heineken Cup or Amlin Challenge Cup from next season. Instead of competing in European Rugby Cup (ERC) competitions, the PRL and LNR plan to form an alternative Rugby Champions Cup. Details of this competition could be rolled out next month. PRL and LNR are unhappy at how teams qualify for the Heineken Cup, especially from the RaboDirect Pro12 league, and how proceeds are shared. Currently, only the top six clubs in England and France are guaranteed a place in the Heineken Cup, whereas at least 10 Pro12 outfits - including both Scottish teams (Edinburgh and Glasgow), both Italian teams (Treviso and Zebre) and a minimum of three sides each from Wales and Ireland - have automatic entry into the competition. As part of the new proposals, only seven clubs from the Pro12 would qualify for the primary tournament. In addition, the revenue would be split evenly between the three leagues - the English Premiership, France's Top 14 and the Pro12 - as proposed by English and French clubs in June of last year. But PRL said Thursday's developments offer "no more than half a solution" to the crisis. "It seems that the proposals we have made on competition formats and on financial distribution have been accepted," said its chief executive Mark McCafferty. "Hopefully, it is a sign that in due course the whole approach we've been proposing is bought into. I guess time will tell. "It is far from complete, but the pieces they have commented on are in line with what we've proposed. "We have always said that there is no way we are going into any competitions that are run by ERC after the end of this season. That hasn't changed. "We feel a fresh start has got to be made." Remaining stumbling blocks are the rival television broadcasting deals between Sky and BT and the insistence of English and French outfits that clubs should run European competitions, rather than the unions. Representatives from the Rugby Football Union, French Rugby Federation, Scottish Rugby Union, Welsh Rugby Union, Irish Rugby Union and Italian Rugby Federation were all present in Dublin. They issued a statement which read: "Progress has been made on a number of issues relating to the future of European club rugby competition. "The primary competition would be made up of 20 clubs, with six each from PRL and the LNR, and seven from the Pro12 tournament. "The clubs would come through meritocratic qualification from their respective leagues and, in the case of the Pro12, there will be at least one club guaranteed from each country. "In year one, the 20th place would be allocated through a play-off match between the seventh-placed PRL and LNR clubs. "The secondary competition would consist of up to 20 clubs made up of the remaining 18 PRL, LNR and Pro12 clubs. Two places could be allocated to clubs qualifying from a third competition. "There is also consensus that distributable revenues generated through the competitions would be divided one third, one third, one third per league with the stipulation that monies to be received by the Pro12 countries would not be less than the current levels." The PRL, the LNR and the four Welsh regions have not yet been consulted on the proposals and it is unclear who will run these proposed European club competitions from next year. </body>

      <title>England set to kick off World Cup</title>
      <description>England and Australia kick off the 14th World Cup on Saturday in a double-header at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.</description>

      <body>England and Australia will kick off the 14th World Cup at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday in the first game of a double-header in Cardiff. The Kangaroos suffered a shock defeat by New Zealand in 2008, and the Kiwis are one of 14 teams in the competition, alongside debutants Italy and the USA. There will be 28 matches in England, Wales, Ireland and France with the final at Old Trafford on 30 November. Wales take on Italy in Saturday's second game in Cardiff. Co-hosts Wales are in Group C, while Italy are in Group D, with the two groups of weaker nations playing each other to produce two quarter-finalists - a format designed to ensure every team in the competition has a chance of scoring tries and winning a game. Three teams will also advance into the quarter-finals from each of groups A and B, containing the stronger nations. The Azzurri - at 13th the second-lowest ranked team in the World Cup - stunned Steve McNamara's England men in a warm-up match, winning 15-14 in Salford. But England will be boosted knowing they possess a pack containing the Burgess trio of Sam, George and Thomas from NRL side South Sydney Rabbitohs, as well as Grand Final winner Sam Tomkins at full-back. St Helens hooker James Roby insists the side are ready for the clash against eight-time champions Australia. "We know we need to perform and we know we need to improve a hell of a lot," said Roby. "They've been a similar team for the last few years. We've played against them a number of times so we know what to expect. "The NRL lads are playing against them week in, week out so they'll have a few things that we might not know and that can only help us." Overwhelming favourites Australia, boast a team consisting of Johnathan Thurston, Cooper Cronk, Cameron Smith and Billy Slater who all play together for Queensland in the State of Origin. Australia coach Tim Sheens is expecting an England backlash following the defeat by Italy. "I know Steve will be disappointed but, to me, a side that's embarrassed is a dangerous side," said Sheens. "I saw what I wanted to see, but, as far as the result is concerned, that's for England to worry about, not me. My concern is to make sure that we're on song for our first game." New Zealand, in Group B with Papua New Guinea, France and Samoa, will be looking to emulate the success of five years ago when they picked up the trophy for the first time. And they will buoyed by the late inclusion of dual-code international Sonny Bill Williams who won the NRL title with Sydney Roosters. Williams is confident he can cope with the pressure of bidding to become the first player to win World Cups in both rugby league and rugby union. "From the start of this season, there was a lot of pressure. I had everything to lose and the pressure was firmly on me," he said. "I guess I kind of thrive on that. It gets the best out of me. I seem to be able to push that to one side and focus on all the little things." Wales are making their third appearance in the tournament and coach Iestyn Harris expects his side to reach the quarter-finals. "The crucial thing for us is to get out of the group," he said. "We've got three difficult opponents. When you get through your group, then it's knockout football and that's where you want to be." Scotland coach Steve McCormack hopes skipper Danny Brough of Huddersfield Giants can lead his side by example, with the Bravehearts set to face Tonga and Italy. "You don't get the Man of Steel by not being a good player," said McCormack. "We're not a team of superstars, but we're a team of really good players that work very hard together. Danny is at the head of that. He works exceptionally hard." Ireland have been handed a tough group alongside England, Australia and Fiji, and coach Mark Aston said: "We haven't had the luxury of going to South Africa for a training camp but we're coming together. "It's a case of blending individuals into a collective and the group are getting close." </body>

      <title>The phone you can build like Lego</title>
      <description>A video for a phone that comes apart like Lego has raised enormous interest online - but could it ever become a reality?</description>

      <body>A new mobile phone concept that would give users a chance to choose from a range of components, and replace or upgrade them when necessary, has generated enormous interest online. But could this sustainable, modular device ever become a reality? Six months ago, the Dutch designer Dave Hakkens took apart his favourite camera. "I noticed all these little parts," he says. "And everything was good except for the lens motor. That had broken." But when Hakkens contacted the manufacturer to get a replacement motor, he was advised to just replace the whole camera. "With your bike you repair the tyre, you don't throw the bike away," he says. "But for some reason this is what we do with electronics." Hakkens realised that if a device could be taken apart and upgraded more easily it would last much longer, minimising electrical waste. And so the idea of Phonebloks was born. The concept - Hakkens hasn't figured out how to actually make it - is for a phone with a replaceable screen and easily moveable, changeable "bloks", each containing a different element such as battery, chipset, gyroscope and so on. In the video Hakkens made to publicise Phonebloks, the bits fall into place on the backplate of the phone like pieces of Lego. The bloks vary in size and can be made to tessellate in any number of combinations. "Let's say this is your phone and you do everything in the cloud - why not replace your storage blok with a bigger battery blok?" asks the voiceover. "If you're like this guy and love to take pictures, why not upgrade your camera?" Last month, Hakkens set about showing off Phonebloks using the "crowd speaking" platform Thunderclap. Users donate their social reach to a project they support, allowing the site to commandeer their Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook accounts to broadcast a message at a single, predetermined moment. Hakkens was aiming for 500 people to sign up to his Thunderclap, but the Phonebloks video went viral, gaining seven million views in three days. He has now amassed 950,000 Thunderclap supporters and on Tuesday the Phonebloks video will ping across social networks 375 million times. "It comes down to a consumer signal," says Kyle Wiens, the founder of iFixit.com, a repository for user-generated repair manuals to the latest gadgets. "The market needs to indicate to manufacturers that we care about modular, repairable hardware." Phones have never been as modular as computers, but Wiens says they used to be sturdier and more repairable. Take batteries. Until the iPhone came along in 2007, batteries on all handsets could be readily removed. With every new phone the power source is a little bit harder to get to, stuck down with more glue, or tucked away in a case that's more impregnable. To get the battery out of the HTC One, the geeks at iFixit had to mangle the phone's casing and remove the motherboard. "I wish batteries were more replaceable than they are," says Bruce Harvey, an electrical engineer at Florida State University. "The reason they're not is in order to make the phone so small, the battery's shape is conformed to fit in there, rather than be a square block [like Phonebloks]." It is consumer preference for a small phone that has pushed manufacturers to hide their batteries away. In the same way, our craving for ever-slimmer, speedier phones has led them to pile hardware - such as the central processor, memory and wifi - on to the same chip, not separate them out into blocks. Harvey believes that Phonebloks is a technical challenge but an achievable one. The bloks could talk to one another if they were all designed to work with the same signalling system. However, he says the real difficulty would be in making a modular phone robust enough to survive the "harsh environment" of the trouser pocket. Each component would have to be encased in a material such as plastic, adding thickness and making the device less sexy. "It's one of those things where if people look at it they say, 'Wow, I can be more ecologically sound, I get upgrades when I want to…'" he says. "Then someone shows them that their phone's going to be six-tenths of an inch (1.5cm) thick or something like that. Reality will meet up with hopes and dreams." The challenge of marketing a modular system doesn't end with the chubbiness problem. "We sadly live in a disposable society and people do have an expectation that they will change their phone every so often," says Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight (and proud owner of more than 800 handsets going back two decades). How long people hang on to a handset varies across the world. On average it's just over three years, but in the US it's just 20 months. Although new devices are almost always bought on a contract, people have come to regard their new phone as a "free upgrade". Lots of us wait impatiently for upgrade day - phone technology is advancing so fast that multiple components, though still functional, feel outdated after a couple of years. However, this trend may not continue indefinitely, Wood says. Mobile phones could be approaching an "innovation plateau" where the basics like speed and screen resolution are as good as they can get. Add to this the regular software "drops" that make our phones feel like new, and people might start hanging on to their handsets for longer. In this kind of market, Phonebloks might become viable, Wood argues. Home computers reached an innovation plateau some years ago, but while we replace our computers less frequently than we used to, not many of us exploit the modular nature of our PCs and upgrade the modules. However, in Hakkens's view that's because it isn't easy enough - only "die-hard geeks" are willing to reach for a screwdriver to unscrew their memory or motherboard. Price is arguably the least important factor in the mobile phone market, but it may represent another challenge for Phonebloks. In the long run, you might think consumers would save money with a modular system that can be continually upgraded and never needs chucking out, but this may not be the case. Big phone companies achieve enormous efficiencies of scale by negotiating special rates with parts manufacturers, buying up production capacity for months at a time. In return, the parts manufacturers get investment for research and development and a guarantee of future business. The idea of marketing "bloks" to end-consumers through a "blokstore" might not be so appealing to these companies, which might in turn prevent similar economies of scale being achieved. Hakkens recognises that neither the big phone companies nor the manufacturers that work with them are likely to jump at his idea - he sees it as a chance for other electronics companies to enter the fray. He says he has been approached by a number of companies and individuals excited about getting involved. "Right now, I'm thinking about what would be the best next step," he says. "Would it be to build it myself, open-source, online - or partner up with companies and collaborators?" He seems to have been caught off guard by the attention his little idea is receiving. "I wasn't planning to do a next step," he admits, "but now I have all these people offering help." Kyle Wiens and Ben Wood are enthusiastic about Phonebloks, but they both believe the concept might end in a half-way house - a phone in which the battery and screen, and possibly the memory and camera, can be easily replaced. For Wiens, the key to making a green phone is different - a design durable enough for the device to reach a second-hand market. "The whole phone doesn't need to be modular so long as it can be repaired and kept in service," he says. Dave Hakkens doesn't pretend to have all the answers, or even certainty that Phonebloks will see the light of day. "Half of the world says it's possible, the other half says it's not possible," he says. "I don't think anyone really knows because no-one's really tried it. So that's the next thing to do - just figure it out." Dave Hakkens spoke to Click on the BBC World Service - listen again to the programme on iPlayer or get the Click podcast.

      <title>Coffee v smoothies: Which is better for you?</title>
      <description>At first glance it seems clear that a smoothie is a healthier option. The answer may not be so clear-cut, says Michael Mosley.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24621394</url>

      <body>One is made of fruit. The other is caffeinated. So a smoothie is a healthier option than a coffee, right? Don't be so sure, says Michael Mosley, as he weighs the evidence. Which is healthier - coffee or smoothies? It seems obvious that the answer must be a smoothie. After all, drinking coffee is a necessary evil while having a smoothie, made from fruit, is part of your five-a-day. But when you look into the scientific studies they reveal something much more surprising. Let's start with coffee. There have been numerous claims down the years that drinking coffee will increase your risk of a whole range of terrible things from heart disease to cancer. These claims have been largely based on case control studies, where you take a group of people who drink coffee and compare them with another matched group who don't. The problem with this approach is that coffee drinkers are more likely than non-coffee drinkers to have other "bad" habits, like drinking alcohol or smoking, so it is hard to tease apart what is really doing the harm. A more reliable way to get at the truth is to do what is called a prospective cohort study. You take a group of disease-free individuals, collect data about them, then follow them for a large number of years to see what happens. When scientists collected data on the coffee drinking habits of 130,000 men and women and then followed them for over 20 years they found that coffee is rather a good thing (The Relationship of Coffee Consumption with Mortality, Annals of Internal Medicine, June 2008). They crunched the numbers and concluded that "regular coffee consumption was not associated with an increased mortality rate in either men or women". In fact, data from this study suggests that moderate coffee consumption is mildly protective, leading to slightly lower all-cause mortality in coffee drinkers than non-coffee drinkers. Based on this and other studies the most effective "dose" is two to five cups a day. More than that and any benefits drop off. There are hundreds of different substances in coffee, including many different flavonoids (compounds widely found in plants that have antioxidant effects). Which of these ingredients is beneficial, we simply don't know. When it comes to the brain, however, the answer seems to be "caffeine". In research recently published in the World Journal of Biological Psychiatry (July 2013) they found that people who drank two to four cups of caffeinated coffee a day were half as likely to commit suicide as those who either drank decaff or fewer than two cups a day. This research pulled together data from three studies that had followed more than 200,000 people for more than 14 years, so it's pretty reliable. It is also supported by a number of other studies, which makes this claim even more plausible. One reason why caffeine may be a mild anti-depressant is that as well as making you more alert, it increases levels of neurotransmitters in the brain, like dopamine and serotonin, that are known to improve mood. The researchers don't recommend going overboard, noting that "there is little further benefit for consumption above two to three cups". One note of caution is that these trials began many years ago so the sort of coffee consumption being tested is almost certainly good, old-fashioned coffee. A simple mug of coffee delivers somewhere between zero and 60 calories, depending on whether it is black, white or white with one sugar. Cappuccinos, lattes and mochas contain coffee but they also contain a lot of calories - anything between 100 and 600 - so when it comes to fancy coffees I limit myself to the occasional tall, skinny cappuccino (70 calories). But what about fruit smoothies? They may consist of pure fruit but by the time you've got rid of the peel and mashed the fibre then you have already lost many of the potential health benefits. What you are mainly left with is a sugary drink. In a survey published in early 2013, researchers found that out of 52 commercial smoothies, 41 had more sugar than Coca-Cola (a 12oz can contains the equivalent of about nine teaspoons), and all had more calories. Fruit smoothies are acidic and the bits cling to your teeth, so dentists are not enthusiastic. An apple a day may keep the doctor away, but not when it's been peeled, blended, mashed and packaged. In a study published in August 2013 in the British Medical Journal (Fruit Consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes) they found that while eating fruit cuts your risk of developing diabetes, drinking it appears to increase the risk. This was another big study involving lots of people followed for many years. An interesting finding was that different fruits gave different levels of benefit. Three servings of blueberries, for example, cut the risk of diabetes by 26%, while eating apples, pears, bananas and grapefruits also had a positive, albeit much smaller, effect. Overall those who ate fruit cut their risk of developing diabetes by 2%, while those who drank it (more than three glasses of fruit juice a week) increased their risk by 8%. More bad news for fruit juice drinkers comes from a case-controlled study done in Western Australia that examined the daily diets of more than 2,000 people. They found that eating some types of fruit and vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower and apples) cuts your risk of colorectal cancer, while drinking fruit juice was associated with an increased risk of rectal cancer. Sugary drinks lead to raised levels of the hormone insulin and persistently high levels of insulin are associated with increased risk of some cancers. The researchers point out that many things that protect against bowel cancer, such as antioxidants and fibre, are lost or diminished during the juicing process. None of these studies specifically looked at the health benefits or otherwise of fruit smoothies, which are a relatively recent phenomenon, nor did they look at the impact of different types of juice - for instance, whether it was freshly squeezed or from concentrate, home-made or shop-bought. I would assume, for example, that drinking a home-made vegetable smoothie is going to be a lot better for you than a commercial fruit smoothie. And I very much doubt that the occasional fruit juice or fruit smoothie is going to do any harm. Nonetheless, I've personally given up buying them and we rarely have them in the house. I eat whole fruit and when it comes to soft drinks I'm sticking to water, tea and, of course, coffee. Trust Me I'm A Doctor is broadcast on BBC Two at 20:00 BST on Thursday 24 October, or catch up with iPlayer Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook Michael Mosley answered readers' questions on Twitter using #AskMichael. Q: The article seems to conflate smoothies and juices re lack of fibre. Does fibre in a handmade smoothie blunt insulin? A: Commercial juices and smoothies are lower in fibre than eating fruit and veg. Handmade ones may be better but will still be lower than fruit and veg. Eating apples will keep you feeling full for longer than drinking same amount as apple juice. I met someone who takes it to the extreme. He peels the apple, eats the peel, throw rest away. Q: Why do you persist in offering fad diets when we have the examples of sportsmen who just eat right and exercise? A: The simple message, "eat less, do more exercise" simply doesn't work with most people. It's time to acknowledge that. Q: Is it ok to eat 4 fruits each day, eg: banana, grapes, apple, orange? Is this too much sugar? A: Banana and grapes have lots sugar. Apples, pears and berries have less sugar. Vegetables generally have lower GI and calories. Commercial smoothies are often banana based, so they have lots of sugar and calories. Q: What is worse? High fat, low carbohydrate or high carbohydrate low fat diets? A: I think the important thing is the type of carbohydrates and type of fat. Highly processed food is bad. Q: It seems what we are told is either good or bad for us changes like the wind. How do we know what to believe? A: The problem is that many health beliefs are based on poor studies. The best option is a prospective cohort study. In a prospective cohort study you follow people over time, not at a moment in time. When this was done for coffee drinking it was shown to be mildly beneficial. Q: I only ever have proper butter, never spreads or margarine. Do I need to only have tiny amounts though? A: I eat butter rather than margarine, as do many cardiologists I know. But it's rich in calories, so I am restrained. Q: Any good news on the horizon for chronic migraine? A: On Trust Me I'm a Doctor we looked at Botox which seems to work quite well for chronic migraine. Q: Drinking enough water is important, but how important is the pH value in tap water? A: The idea we should drink 2 litres a day is a myth. Drink when you're thirsty. I don't know about the effect of pH in water. Q: Is one banana a day too many? A: No. Eating fruit is generally good. Q: Yes or no, should we drink pure fruit smoothies? A: I don't. If it tastes sweet it has lots of sugar. Some have more than 10 teaspoons of sugar. </body>

      <body>The high cost of rent in the UK forces many people into multiple-person houseshares. A new documentary asks if it's possible to find the perfect flatmate. The 1990s black comedy Shallow Grave has always been a kind of cautionary tale for housesharers. Both interviewing people and being interviewed can be unpleasant and it's easy to pick someone who turns out to be a less than delightful match. Rent has been rocketing in recent years in London and other parts of the UK, taking a one-bedroom flat out of the reach of many people. The Office for National Statistics doesn't measure housesharing specifically, but you can get a feel of numbers from the 2011 census. There were 1,850,137 households which were neither one person nor a family in England and Wales. This accounts for 7.9% of all households, an increase from 6.7% in 2001. The socially fussy will only share with people who are already friends, or vouched for by a friend. Others opt for particular websites like Gumtree, Spareroom and Moveflat. There are still some who browse the ballpoint pen scrawl on cards in newsagents' windows. The truly exotic might attend a "speedflatmating" event. Like speed dating, the idea is to allow the tenants to meet several people at the same time without having to go through the process of "interviewing" people one by one. Being forced together with other people by economics, housesharers want to pick the right person. There are sometimes surprising demands - those wanting food included, or people with multiple unusual pets. A new Channel 4 documentary, How to Find the Perfect Flatmate, explores the difficult process. The strangeness of the whole experience is summed up in He Died With A Falafel in His Hand, the memoirs-cum-novel of serial housesharer John Birmingham. When he was picking people to live with he had three questions he always asked: But there's a serious side to living with strangers. Can they be trusted? Is it safe to be around them? This has to be guessed from a few minutes over a cup of tea with another candidate waiting on the doorstep. What happens if you get an unreliable alcoholic who happens to visit on his one lucid day? But bad surprises can happen even with someone who is supposed to be a friend. Genevieve (not her real name) shared a flat in New York with her boyfriend, a friend and one of their classmates, Ben. "In September, Ben arrived with no socks in New York, so we each lent him three pairs of socks. As the weeks went by, he still didn't have any socks and we had fewer and fewer socks in our own drawers. All three of us had lost at least five pairs of socks. "One day during November, we went into his bedroom because we were suspicious. Under the bed we saw a whole stack of dirty socks. When we tried to confront him, he wouldn't listen and told us that we were being childish, that these were 'only socks', that it wasn't a big deal. "And this was true I guess, but the point was that he had crossed a line. If he was capable of going into our rooms when we weren't there and looking into our stuff, this meant that he was capable of maybe doing something worse." The whole experience left Genevieve thinking it was better to live with strangers. It avoids the false sense of security at least. Still, at least vaguely knowing someone before living with them is a comfort to many. "I can see the appeal of living with someone new and meeting different people. But it's safer to live with someone you know or someone that is a friend of a friend," says Joshi Herrmann, 24, a journalist at the London Evening Standard who lives with three friends. Herrmann is dubious about the way potential housemates describe themselves online. "They say things like 'I am very hard working', 'I am very neat and tidy' etc. It's as if they are trying to counter someone's impression of the worst flatmate but actually they make themselves look more boring than anything else." When he last advertised for someone for a cramped dark room in his houseshare in east London, he got more than 50 messages in the space of a few days. The housemates only met six potentials and in the end picked a friend of a friend. The theory is that the travails of living with random strangers are best borne when young. When you're skint and in your early 20s it doesn't seem to be so bad to be living with someone who occasionally nicks your milk and plays Sepultura at three in the morning. But there's a generation of older housemates in many parts of the UK now. Over the past five years, the fastest growing age group of sharers on the SpareRoom website has been 45-54-year-olds, who are up by 50%. The total number of flatsharers over 35 has increased by 26%. Birmingham says his book struck a chord with people who have lived in houseshares because there are really only five or six houseshare stories in the whole world. There's mad flatmate, bad flatmate, dirty flatmate and so on. Anyone who's done it has had at least one bad experience. "As long as people share accommodation together, those stories will always be relevant. The archetypes never die. And they never pay their rent." What are your tips for selecting housemates?

      <title>Barroso backs Cameron over red tape</title>

      <body>David Cameron has won the backing of EU chief Jose Manuel Barroso for his push to limit the number of new regulations coming out of Brussels. The two chaired a meeting of EU leaders on the issue at Friday's summit. The prime minister has said firms are being "throttled" by red tape and for every regulation and directive introduced another should be removed. Mr Barroso said more needed to be done to ensure "lighter, simpler, cheaper, common-sense regulation". The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, has said it has already cut 5,590 regulations since 2005. Mr Cameron is committed to renegotiating the UK's relationship with the EU if the Conservative Party wins the next election, ahead of an "in-out" referendum on whether the country should remain a member. In the meantime, he is promising to work to reduce the bureaucracy facing companies. Conservative sources say he wants to see 1,500 regulations reviewed. Eighty business leaders, including the chairmen of BT and Asda, have signed a letter calling for a "strong commitment" by the government towards this and several have accompanied Mr Cameron to Brussels to make the case. The prime minister has made the issue the central objective of the two-day European Council meeting. He held one-to-one meetings with the leaders of Germany and the Netherlands, who share similar views on deregulation, and co-chaired a meeting with the leaders of Poland, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy and Estonia, who are also sympathetic. "The Commission has done an excellent job in lifting the burden of bureaucracy. Now I want to get business engaged," he said, adding that a faster pace of deregulation was essential to getting firms to "compete and succeed". Mr Barroso, the Commission's president, said he appreciated that businesses needed a single set of rules, rather than 28 different bodies of national regulation, for the single market to work and for the important digital economy to continue to grow. Acknowledging that "useless laws weaken necessary laws", he said there were other areas where it was necessary to cut bureaucracy without reducing standards of consumer protection, health and safety and environmental concerns. "That is why we have to slash red tape," he said. </body>

      <title>US spying 'may harm terror fight'</title>
      <description>EU leaders meeting in Brussels say distrust of the US over spying could harm intelligence-gathering in the fight against terrorism.</description>

      <body>EU leaders meeting in Brussels say distrust of the US over spying could harm the fight against terrorism. A statement agreed by the leaders says that "a lack of trust could prejudice" intelligence-gathering co-operation. France and Germany are pushing for talks with the US to find a new "understanding" by the year's end. A number of allegations against US intelligence agents have surfaced this week, including the bugging of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone. In addition there have been claims that the US National Security Agency (NSA) monitored millions of French telephone calls. On Thursday, the UK's Guardian newspaper also reported that it had obtained a confidential memo from the NSA suggesting it had monitored the phones of 35 world leaders. The latest revelations have been sourced to US whistleblower Edward Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who fled the country earlier this year and is now in Russia. They have overshadowed other issues at the EU summit in Brussels, including the Mediterranean migration problem, which frames the agenda of Friday's talks. Italian authorities said they had intercepted some 800 migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean as the EU leaders prepared to meet. The statement of heads of state or government, released on Friday, reflects the EU leaders' conclusions following their talks on Thursday. It says the recent intelligence issues had raised "deep concerns" among European citizens. The statement says the leaders "underlined the close relationship between Europe and the USA and the value of that partnership". It continues: "[The leaders] stressed that intelligence-gathering is a vital element in the fight against terrorism." And it went on: "A lack of trust could prejudice the necessary cooperation in the field of intelligence-gathering." Belgian Prime Minister Elio di Rupo said: "The objective must remain the same - to fight against terrorism but also respect privacy. "Everyone can understand the need for exceptional measures given the danger of terrorism... but we are not in the position where we should spy on each other." Talks among the EU leaders had continued late into Thursday night. Speaking afterwards, Mrs Merkel said: "We need trust among allies and partners. Such trust now has to be built anew. "The United States of America and Europe face common challenges. We are allies. But such an alliance can only be built on trust. That's why I repeat again: spying among friends, that cannot be." Germany and France said they were proposing talks with the US to settle the row by the end of the year. The leaders' statement said: "The heads of state or government took note of the intention of France and Germany to seek bilateral talks with the USA with the aim of finding before the end of the year an understanding on mutual relations in that field. "They noted that other EU countries are welcome to join this initiative." French President Francois Hollande said on Friday; "What is at stake is preserving our relations with the United States." BBC Europe editor Gavin Hewitt says the French and Germans are looking for a new set of rules with a "no spying pact" at the core. He says this would mirror an arrangement the United States has had with Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada since just after World War II. That secret intelligence-sharing operation is known as Five Eyes. EU President Herman Van Rompuy accepted the UK had "a special relationship" with the US, but said Britain was "completely on board with this text". UK PM David Cameron has yet to comment. But a number of other leaders have indicated their support for the French and German position. Finnish PM Jyrki Katainen said: "We have to talk together with the Americans, and try to find some sort of code of conduct [on] how to cooperate on this kind of issue in the future." Swedish PM Fredrik Reinfeldt said it was "completely unacceptable" to eavesdrop on the leader of an ally, a view echoed by Italian PM Enrico Letta, who added: "We want the truth." But the BBC's Chris Morris in Brussels says that, despite the widespread anger about American spying, Mrs Merkel opposed a suggestion to suspend trade talks with the United States - and on that point, the UK will be relieved. Other leaders signalled the need to move on. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said: "The main thing is that we look to the future. The trans-Atlantic partnership was, and is, important." Mrs Merkel had raised her concerns with US President Barack Obama in a call on Wednesday. White House spokesman Jay Carney later said Mr Obama had assured Mrs Merkel that her phone was not being listened to now and would not be in the future. However, his statement left open the question of whether calls had been listened to in the past. </body>

      <title>Campaigners press PM over cold homes</title>
      <description>Campaigners write to David Cameron demanding action on the "national crisis" of cold homes, as people are advised to keep houses well heated.</description>

      <body>Fuel poverty campaigners have written to Prime Minister David Cameron demanding cross-party action on the "national crisis" of cold homes. Campaigners said the UK was second only to Estonia for people struggling to pay their energy bills across Europe. It came as Public Health England urged people to keep their homes well heated this winter to avoid potentially fatal health problems. It said living rooms should be 21C (70F) and other home areas 18C (65F). Campaign group Energy Bill Revolution - an alliance of charities including Age UK and Barnardos - said the biggest problem in the UK was "leaky homes" and called for investment in a domestic insulation programme. Energy Bill Revolution said "woeful" levels of insulation had left Britain falling way behind comparable European countries such as Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands. Campaign director Ed Matthew said: "Our political leaders are falling over themselves to come up with headline-grabbing ways to cut energy bills yet they fall woefully short of a true solution to the energy bill crisis. "By far the biggest opportunity to cut energy bills is to fully insulate the UK's leaky homes. No other investment can do so much for so many. If the government is serious about solving this crisis they must make insulating homes the UK's number one infrastructure priority." Public Health England's advice came in its Cold Weather Plan for 2013, after four of the big six energy companies announced price rises. Age UK said older people in particular were increasingly anxious about the cost of heating their homes. Winter health risks range from flu to falls - but the cold can also make heart and respiratory problems much worse. On average there are about 24,000 excess winter deaths in England each year, many of which experts say are preventable. The plan has been produced in collaboration with the Department of Health, NHS England and the Local Government Association. It contains advice for the NHS and local government, as well as individuals. This includes having your flu vaccination if you are in an at-risk group, ensuring homes are properly insulated and making sure heating systems are routinely checked. From November, the Met Office will issue cold weather alerts if the temperature dips to 2C (35F) or less, or if there is severe winter weather such as heavy snow or widespread ice. Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection and medical director at Public Health England, said: "In colder weather, keeping yourself warm is essential to staying healthy, especially for the very young, older people or those with a chronic condition such as heart disease and asthma." Public health minister Jane Ellison said: "The elderly and those with long-term illnesses are particularly at risk during winter months so it's crucial that people stay warm." Age UK's charity director Caroline Abrahams said: "Being cold is a huge health risk for older people so it is absolutely essential that older people stay warm during the winter months. "But with fuel poverty blighting the lives of millions of households in the UK many older people are feeling increasingly anxious about the rising cost of energy. "The government must show it has a clear long-term plan to make low income homes more energy efficient." Labour's shadow energy and climate change minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: "People are being left in real hardship because David Cameron won't stand up to the energy companies. "Britain's energy is market is not working for families and business." </body>

The announcement sparked a deal of hand wringing and some dire predictions - it would be Armageddon in the countryside, as the disease that had decimated European forests let rip in this green and pleasant land. It was even claimed that a third of Britain's trees might be lost in little more than a generation.

      <title>Does football need early kick-offs?</title>
      <description>Do early kick-offs really help prevent football violence?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-24606069</url>

      <body>This weekend Sunderland play Newcastle United for the first time since more than 100 fans were arrested after trouble following a game last season. Like that fixture, Sunday's match will kick off earlier than many fans would like, but do early starts still prevent violence? April's Tyne-Wear derby at St James' Park will be remembered for events both on and off the pitch. Sunderland won on Tyneside for the first time in almost 13 years and the aftermath of the game is still making its way through the courts. Several Newcastle fans received prison sentences, including one man who was jailed for a year after he admitted punching a police horse, and two 12-year-old boys are now among the youngest in the country to have football banning orders. It came as some surprise to fans, then, when Sunday's match between the fierce rivals was originally scheduled for 16:00 GMT by Sky Sports, but no one connected to either club was shocked when the kick-off was brought forward to 13:30 for safety reasons. Early kick-offs are unpopular with fans attending games and some have questioned whether they still serve their purpose of reducing drinking time. Kevin Miles from the Football Supporters' Federation said he was "yet to be convinced" the measure was still relevant. "The fact is that once you give agencies like the police additional powers of this kind, they'll be very reluctant to relinquish them," he said. "From what I can see there appears to be little correlation between the time a game starts and the numbers of arrests made, especially at derby games. "The last Tyne-Wear derby was an early kick-off, yet the number of arrests was among the highest ever. Added to that was the fact the less than 10% of those arrested had actually attended the game." Home Office statistics released this month revealed more Newcastle fans had been arrested than any other club during the 2012-13 season, with the figure vastly inflated by the trouble following Sunderland's 3-0 win on Tyneside in April. The figures showed football arrests had risen by 4% but the number of fans held for alcohol-related issues was down from 800 to 549 year-on-year. Geoff Pearson from Liverpool University has researched the impact of alcohol restrictions on football crowds and found fans observed in a study would go to "extraordinary lengths" to overcome "practical and legal measures". He said early kick-offs did reduce the alcohol consumed, although perhaps not as much as police forces would like. "Fans will start earlier, but if you have a 17:30 kick-off, fans belonging to that drinking sub-culture are going to drink for about five hours before the game, whereas if you had a midday kick-off, they're not going to be drinking for as long. "They might start at 10:00 maybe, but they're not going to be consuming the same amount. "What does happen is that over the course of the day an early kick-off means there's going to be more drinking time in total." Mr Pearson said early kick-offs could lead to volatile situations for "same city derbies" where fans would mix long after the game Fans on either side of the Wear-Tyne divide point to relaxed licensing laws as an example of why the measure may now have less of an impact than in the past. Gary Stephens, a former chairman of Sunderland's fan liaison group, believes early kick-offs should be scrapped. "They absolutely do not work", he said. "As far as drinking goes, you can't stop it. Pubs can open whenever they want, now that we've got 24 hour drinking. But even if they didn't, people can simply go to the supermarket, get tanked up and still cause trouble." Of its 384 licensed premises, Sunderland Council said 67 were able to serve alcohol before 11:00 BST. It has rejected one temporary application to serve from 08:00 BST on Sunday after objections from police. Northumbria Police's operations commander for Sunday's game Ch Supt Steve Neill said "public safety and the welfare of fans" was the "absolute priority". "We sometimes seek earlier kick-off times for the derby to reduce the length of time people have to consume alcohol and to help prevent the likelihood of crime and disorder," he said. Mark Jensen, editor of Newcastle fanzine The Mag, said he had not found any football fan that had "anything to say" for early kick-offs. "It's crazy in this day and age that a crowd of around 50,000 can be inconvenienced just because of the risk a small minority might cause trouble. "When there's so much money in football and the police have CCTV and all their other resources it does seem mad that you can't have a match after a certain time. "Police will always play the public order card but after the match at St James' Park in April that seems to have been blown out of the water." Ch Supt Neill said the police priority was for "supporters to be able to enjoy the game". He will join fans of both clubs in hoping Sunday's talking points are generated purely on the field. </body>

      <body>It is reputedly the most haunted highway in Scotland. The A75 in Dumfriesshire is said to have had more reports of supernatural activity than any other road in the country. Now a Dumfries-based group of paranormal investigators has collated the stories for a ghostly Halloween road trip on Saturday night. The Kinmount straight on the road is the most notorious spot for sightings. John Hill, of Mostly Ghostly paranormal investigators, said: "So much has happened at this spot. "A quick search of the internet would bring up the A75 as the most haunted road in Scotland and some say Britain. "There are so many different things have happened on this road and been seen by so many different people as well." Mr Hill and Mostly Ghostly founder Kathleen Cronie have researched the road's supernatural history to compile the first ever ghost coach tour of the road. They have some spine-chilling accounts to relate. "There have been screaming hags, eyeless phantoms and a menagerie of unearthly creatures witnessed on this famous road," said Ms Cronie. She said one of the most infamous sightings was made by Derek and Norman Ferguson, in 1962. "They were driving along here and the whole incident began with a large hen flying towards the windscreen of their car," she said. "They then witnessed great cats and various other creatures as well as witnessing a phantom furniture van - which is a bit unusual to say the least." Bob Sturgeon lives beside the A75 and used to run a roadside snack van - at Carrutherstown, near to the sighting "hotspot". "There was very rarely a week went past without somebody telling me about some experience and usually along that Kinmount straight," he said. His business was a frequent early morning refuge for traumatised lorry drivers who had parked overnight in nearby lay-bys. "They weren't the kind of people who would talk to each other," he explained. "They were long-distance drivers - they were well separated - so it wasn't as if there was a group of them gathered in a pub and passed round stories. "Most of these things were all just individual experiences." A common sighting was groups of dejected bedraggled people pulling handcarts or carrying bundles like some medieval camp followers. One man was so shocked, he gave up lorry driving altogether and Mr Sturgeon never saw him again. "He had been parked on the Kinmount straight and he had woken up at the back of three in the morning and he saw this 'parade' of people," he said. "He said that it went on for ages and he had just frozen - he was in an awful state. "It doesn't matter if you blame it on imagination or fact or whatever, it certainly affected him badly." Documented reports of ghosts on this road go back at least 50 years. As well as seeing assorted animals, horsemen and carriages, some drivers have been convinced they have run over people - phantom figures of men, women, couples emerging from the dark. Saturday night's ghost tour is for Halloween but it is likely to be repeated several times a year, for those with the stomach to listen to the stories and the nerve to face the possibility of a spooky experience of their own. </body>

      <title>The iconic voices of technology</title>
      <description>Meeting the faces behind technology's most iconic voices</description>

      <body>Millions of people hear their voices every day - but would you recognise them if you saw them walking down the street? Well maybe now you will. The BBC met the faces behind four of the most famous and iconic voices heard in technology today. Siri, Apple's voice-powered personal assistant, made its debut in June 2010. Since then, millions of the devices with the feature have been sold worldwide. In the UK, the voice you will hear responding to commands belongs to Jon Briggs, an illustrious voiceover artist whose portfolio includes the likes of the Weakest Link, Radio 2 and Channel 4. Jon had offered up his voice to a firm that specialises in computer-generated speech - that is, taking Jon's voice but moulding it to say virtually any possible phrase. Apple, when creating Siri, picked out Jon - unbeknownst to him. "I discovered that I was being used as the voice of Siri when Rory Cellan-Jones, the BBC technology correspondent, suddenly started demonstrating it on BBC Breakfast. "I thought 'I recognise that voice!', and so it was true - and it's a slightly bizarre journey since then." It means that while his voice is now being played out countless times a day all over the country, Apple has not paid him - he only received the fee earned he when recording the original material. But, he says he's excited to be "in early" on what he believes is changing how we use technology. "You can take a photograph of your desk - there is a screen a keyboard and a mouse. "You will show it to your children or your grandchildren and they will laugh and go 'you had a thing called a mouse? What's that funny thing with letters on?'" In contrast to the received pronunciation of her "Tube" voice, Emma Clarke's speaking voice is in fact Northern - growing up, as she did, in Sale near Manchester. Her voice can be heard across the Bakerloo, Central and District lines of London's iconic Underground network. The process of getting the job was long and painstaking - months of focus groups and whittling down possible candidates. During the selection, each possible voice was given a codename. Emma's, apparently, was 'Marilyn'. "Had they named me 'Brenda' I'm not sure I'd have got the gig," she jokes. She now gets fan mail from all over the world, particularly from Texas. "People initially thought I was actually on the train!" she says, "Or in some kind of central control room. I don't know where they thought it was." She says she is proud to lend her voice to the network, but adds that she hopes some of the lines she recorded never have to be heard by the public. "There were a couple of emergency announcements, that I remember when I read them on the script I thought 'oh god, imagine how these people will feel when they hear these announcements. "I felt such a sense of responsibility, of calming people down." Unlike the other voices in this piece, Terry Green is the only one who doesn't consider his voice to be his profession. He found his way to audio fame indirectly. He specialises in customer service, and the systems used in shops to get things moving and punters through the tills. And so it was, when the company he was working for needed a male voice to beckon people to the till, he stepped forward: "Cashier number three, please..." "We just sat down with a digital voice recorder, laid down the track, and that was it! I was on the prototype system, and then suddenly rolled out to 8,000 shops." They recorded up to cashier number 25 - but now the system goes much further. Indeed, around the world, the company's technology is used in thousands of stores - although with local voices instead of Terry's. Now he makes his living as a leading expert on the study of shoppers' behaviour. "My voice was on all these systems that we were rolling out, so I was becoming more and better known. I started writing white papers, and eventually I came to write a book." One morning, Sara Mendes da Costa was listening to Terry Wogan on Radio 2 when he mentioned that a competition would be held to find the new voice of the Speaking Clock. "A little bell rang in my head and I went 'oooh!'" She wasn't alone - within moments she had had calls friends and family saying she should put herself forward. She won, and from 2007 she took over the voice of the Speaking Clock, which is called up approximately 60 million times each year. It was a job she was excited, but nervous, to take on. "Brian Cobby, who sadly passed away last year, had the most beautiful, rich, Shakespearian voice. "Then I came along - I have visions of people going 'oh...'!" "But they wanted something different, someone a bit more of the moment, a little bit more who we are now." Sara uses the Speaking Clock regularly in her day-to-day work, and admits she just can't resist listening to each and every word. "I listen until when it goes through to 'precisely' - and only then I can hang up! "It's just a weird thing that I've got." Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <title>Liz West: An artist with extra Spice</title>
      <description>How a Spice Girls obsession helped an art career</description>

      <body>Artist Liz West is gaining a glowing reputation for her colour-drenched light installations - but her art career might not have taken off if it were not for her world-record collection of Spice Girls memorabilia. Art and pop can go hand-in-hand, she explains. West is taking part in two exhibitions this week - one featuring her strips of coloured light radiating from the corner of an old warehouse, which is in the Synthesis exhibition as part of Manchester Science Festival. She has a growing reputation as a contemporary artist thanks to her arrangements of lights in precise, pleasing patterns and her collections of objects bathed in bright, bold hues. For the other exhibition, she has lent some of the 5,000 Spice Girls items she has amassed since the age of 11, including branded clothes, crisp packets and a clock, to an exhibition celebrating 40 years of Virgin Records in London. As well as being an artist, West holds the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of Spice Girls memorabilia. "The way I see it is that installation art is high culture and Spice Girls is pop culture," she says. "Although the two hold hands, they're separate." When looking to launch her art career, West's Spice Girls obsession came in useful when she found she could get paid for loaning her girl-powered pop collection to museums, film crews and events. "Because I was given that financial boost to start with, my art practice has been able to roll and roll," she says. "Now I'm able to fund my art practice through my art. I don't have to work in Starbucks part-time. A lot of artists do have to work part-time, and I think that would kill any creativity for me. It really would." West was born into the art world - almost literally - almost born on the floor of the Whitworth Gallery in Manchester, she says, when her mother Jenny was artist in residence there 28 years ago. A five-day-old West attended the opening of her mother's exhibition. When she was seven years old, West remembers putting nail varnish bottles on a bedroom shelf in line according to their colour. It is not difficult to spot a link between her love of colour as a child and the artworks she now creates. Then when she was 11, the Spice Girls arrived. "A very impressionable age, I think," she says. "I was hooked. The colour, the energy, the different personalities. That appealed - more so probably than the music." When the Spice Girls' second album came out in 1997, West decided to collect any and every recording and item of memorabilia she could get her hands on. "I'd go to the pound shop and buy bags of things as a 13- or 14-year-old. They brought out the dolls and I went to London to the Hamleys sale. "Of course, when eBay appeared when I was 18, I had a student loan, went a bit mad, and it just continued." Influenced by her parents (her father Steve is also an artist), West attended the prestigious Glasgow School of Art. "When I was a student, I'd go into the studio all day and then I'd go into the library in the evening and just bid and bid and bid [on eBay]," she says. "I'd have a day of art and an evening of Spice." West says she has spent "tens of thousands" of pounds on her collection, which also includes outfits from the Brit Awards, the Spiceworld movie and the jacket Mel B wore to meet Nelson Mandela. But it does not include the most iconic Spice outfit of them all - Geri Halliwell's union jack dress from the 1997 Brit Awards. That was bought by the Hard Rock Cafe in Las Vegas for £41,000. "That's the holy grail," West says. "And it's in storage. That's quite upsetting." Now, West's art career is taking off thanks to her luminous installations that look like she has dismantled and rearranged a rainbow. "Did you see the rainbow the other day over Manchester?" she says excitedly at the mention of rainbows. "This was a double one and it was a proper arch. I stopped in the street for about five minutes and stared at it. "I thought, forget James Turrell and Olafur Eliasson and all the artists that I absolutely love - this is true absolute beauty. There's something in that that I could never create, even if I tried." West says she is not worried about her Spice Girls obsession undermining her reputation as an artist. "It's completely in keeping with my personality," she says. "And because I've got such a passion for it, I win people over with that passion. It's not just about T-shirts and dollies. "As a serious artist, this is my career. I want to be nominated for the Turner Prize. "If you look at other artists, there are quite a few that have quirky collections out there and haven't hidden them. I don't have a problem with it." What do other artists say when they find out about the collection? "They think it's quite funny," West replies. "You know, it would be really boring if I didn't do anything else. People tend to think that it's a quirk, and quite a nice one." </body>

      <description>Should our forests be managed or left entirely to nature?</description>

      <body>A year after the first case of ash dieback in mature woodland - and with the disease spreading inexorably - experts are looking at ways to future-proof forests. Stroll around the Woodland Trust's Hucking estate (pictured in satellite views, above) near Maidstone in Kent and you could be forgiven for thinking little has changed in centuries. Sheep graze on the swathes of grassland between the gentle chalk hills. Pockets of ancient woodland carpet the hilltops and valleys. In reality, however, this seemingly timeless rural landscape is in constant flux and the effects of ash dieback will soon be all too apparent. Trees on the estate show the hallmarks of the disease in the black, shrivelled leaves hanging from the branches of diminutive seedlings and the magnificent ash trees that tower above. Ash dieback is spreading fast in this Area of Outstanding Beauty known as the Kent Downs, with trees bearing the scars of the chalara fungus. "See that lovely big ash up there," says site manager Clive Steward, pointing out a huge tree in a patch of ancient woodland. "Underneath it - see the big wide leaves - that's sycamore. It's just waiting to take over really. Because that's what will happen." Nature is poised to fill in the gaps if - as experts predict - millions of native ash trees die. Britain's forests have been through much turmoil in modern times, from the harvesting of timber for the shipbuilding industry to the arrival of pathogens such as Dutch elm disease in the 1970s. But the current speed of change is alarming ecologists. They say trees are facing unprecedented threats, with a recent increase in findings of new pests and diseases. Many believe it is only a matter of time before threats such as the emerald ash borer beetle, which drills into the trunks of ash trees, reach our shores. In an age of global trade and travel, rather than trying to stop these invaders, the key to safeguarding forests could be to closely manage them - and plant them to be resilient to future threats, be they a new pest, a violent storm, or climate change. Austin Brady of woodland conservation charity the Woodland Trust says to give a wood resilience a range of native species need to be planted, so if a pathogen strikes, at least some of the trees will survive. "For future healthy forests we need forests to have a wider range of native species growing there, so that all our eggs aren't in one basket," says Mr Brady. "So that if a particular pest and disease or issue comes along it won't destroy the whole forest. It might take out some of the components but there'll be enough different species of trees in there for the forest to survive." Maintaining diversity in the age of trees is also important, he says, as is maintaining connections between woods to give wildlife the space to thrive. The Hucking estate is seen as a pioneer of the idea of resilient woodland. A few decades ago, before the estate was taken over by the Woodland Trust, much of it was arable farmland, dotted with patches of ancient woodland. Careful management and planning has restored the natural landscape, with new trees planted to create corridors of habitat for animals and birds to roam. A mixture of native trees were used, which stand a better chance of withstanding tree diseases that are moving around the world. Mr Brady sees the practice as trying to "mimic nature". But some believe management in this way is artificial, and that nature will find its own level. Naturalist and writer Richard Mabey argues catastrophes like tree diseases are natural events, from which woods will recover without intervention. "Woody vegetation responds, adapts, regroups," he wrote in the New Statesmen. "What emerges in its recovery stage may not be the same as before, but it will always be a vital, dynamic, arboreal community. The same process will happen with ash, perhaps more quickly than we think." Joan Weber of Forest Research, agrees that "nature will fill in the gaps," as it did when elms disappeared, but this is more difficult when one particular species is dominant in a woodland. Austin Brady, however, says Britain's countryside has lost the great, untamed forests still present in countries such as Poland, with a corresponding loss of diversity. "You could make an argument for saying, let's leave forests to nature," he says. "The trouble is - we stopped leaving forests to nature in this country about 2,000 years ago. So we can't suddenly now say let's leave them to nature... we've taken away all the support systems that nature would have had in place." Others question exactly what resilience means. Managing a wood land to guard against the effects of tree diseases will not necessarily help other wildlife in the area, says Ray Dawes of the National Trust . "If you are going to change the tree species you are going to change the wildlife," says Mr Dawes, who believes the prescription for a healthy woodland varies. The National Trust has 400 properties with significant amounts of woodland in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and they are all different. "It's looking at individual woods - their origins, their values and the threats to them," he says. Back at the Hucking estate, Clive Steward spreads out an ordnance survey map over the bonnet of his dusty estate car to point out lanes in the Sussex and Kent weald that were carved by ancient farmers running pigs through the forests. Ash trees have left their mark on the map, recorded in names like Ashford and Asholt Wood. Local conservationists are preparing to record the impact of the ash tree on the landscape from a cultural perspective, in case it is lost. Nick Johannsen, director of the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, grew up during the era of Dutch elm disease, and remembers it well. "It's going to be a longer, slower, more lingering loss than elm was," he says. "But already beautiful ash trees are a shadow of themselves." Ash has long been part of our heritage, he says, used for the framework of early aircraft such as the De Havilland Mosquito, and tennis racquets at Wimbledon. "Not only is it extraordinary in its landscape and its wildlife importance - its natural heritage - it's also part of the cultural heritage of Britain. That's what we want to celebrate - because we are losing ash trees." </body>

      <description>Why do some people prefer extremely bitter drinks?</description>

      <body>There's been a wave of popularity for drinks like the Aperol spritz, the Negroni, and a host of cocktails flavoured with "bitters". Why are people turning their backs on sweet cocktails in favour of a bitter taste? The last two decades have seen an extraordinary resurgence in cocktail-making on both sides of the Atlantic, with everything from Cointreau-sweetened Cosmopolitans to sugary Mojitos being drunk in vast quantities. But there is now a definite trend towards bitter drinks. People are ordering whisky or gin-based drinks paired with vermouths. And there is growing interest in the US, UK and other European nations in Italian amari. These complex, herbal, bittersweet drinks, with names like Averna, Ramazzotti, Montenegro and Fernet Branca, are usually consumed as aperitivi or digestivi - drinks thought to either encourage the appetite before dinner or help with digestion afterwards. Their bitter mixer cousins, Cynar, Campari and Aperol, are increasingly being used in cocktails. Aperol - based on bitter orange and rhubarb and containing classic bitter ingredients like gentian and cinchona (a source of quinine) - has rocketed in popularity in recent years following a push by owner Gruppo Campari. Sales rose 156% in the UK in 2012 and 56% in the US. This year's figures, announced soon, are expected to be even bigger. A poster campaign in the UK encourages people to try an Aperol spritz - prosecco sparkling wine and soda water mixed with Aperol. A fundamental point of the spritz is its low alcohol content. Aperol's slogan is "poco alcolico", roughly meaning a little bit alcoholic. "I think the Aperol spritz was probably the most asked-for drink in the outdoor areas of most decent bars in London this summer," says World Duty Free mixologist Charlie McCarthy. Laura Tallo, from Nonna's Italian Cucina in Bath, says many British drinkers have returned after holidays in Italy, having seen certain drinks paired with tavola calda - the selection of hot, freshly-baked food. "People are definitely beginning to embrace the Italian custom of drinking aperitifs. We have seen a definite trend emerging of people choosing classic Italian pre-dinner drinks such as an Aperol spritz, Negroni [equal parts Campari, gin and sweet vermouth], Americano or Martini," she says. Such drinks are not to everyone's taste, of course. While many Italians have been brought up around the tradition of amari, they can baffle non-Italian palates at first taste. "They say of a Negroni the first two or three sips you despise, and after you have had two or three drinks you start to like it," says Tom Ross, bars manager of the Polpo restaurant group in London. The taste of Fernet Branca - vaguely minty but with pungent undertones of cough medicine - is so powerful that comedian Bill Cosby constructed a seven-minute anecdote around his initial horror on encountering the drink in Italy. And yet Fernet is loved by many, being drunk with cola in Argentina and - accompanied by a separate shot of ginger beer - known as the "bartender's handshake" in San Francisco. One of the first recorded definitions of a cocktail was in a New York journal in 1803, which classified it as a mixture of any "spirituous liquor", with water, sugar and "bitters", known at the time as a bittered sling. You can find the descendant of these traditional bitters (with the term typically referring to both singular and plural) in any decent bar in the UK or US. There'll be a rather unusual bottle among the others - small with a yellow top and an oversized label covered in small print. It is the world's most famous cocktail bitters, Angostura. This bitters is the key ingredient in pink gin, the traditional officers' cocktail in the Royal Navy. It's also the bedrock of famous cocktails, including the Old Fashioned, beloved of Mad Men's Don Draper, and the Manhattan. A supply shortage in 2009 caused panic throughout the world's bartending community, according to McCarthy, and prompted bartenders to start making their own. The current wave of speakeasy-type bars inspired by the prohibition years in the US, has prompted interest in traditional and hitherto forgotten cocktails. This in turn has prompted demand for more unusual bitters. Bob Petrie, of Bob's Bitters, started in 2005 when he was approached by the Dorchester Hotel to create a range. Traditional bitters are very complex, with aromatic flavours brought out from a combination of barks, roots, herbs, and spices by macerating them in alcohol. He looked at pairing them with the "botanicals" in gin, and came up with a range including cardamom, chocolate, coriander, ginger, grapefruit, lavender, liquorice, orange and mandarin, peppermint and vanilla. "Single flavours are a lot easier for the barman as it gives a lot more scope," Petrie says. "What they can do with mine is mix and match." Rochdale-born US celebrity mixologist Gary Regan is another who was prompted to make his own to replicate the orange bitters in some old cocktail recipes. "When I realised it was hard to get good ones I decided to make my own. I stole a recipe from the Gentleman's Companion of 1939. I had about four different trials and eventually got something I liked. "This shift towards bitter has been going on for eight years," Regan estimates. "[But] most bitters aren't that bitter. They taste herbal. In fact, they are a bit on the sweet side sometimes." Fee Brothers in Rochester, New York, has been making bitters since 1863, with a short break for prohibition. Joe and Ellen Fee are the fourth generation. Their 92-year-old father still regularly visits the plant. Joe Fee says there has been a marked increase in sales over the past seven years. "Just about anything can be made into a bitters. They are your spice rack behind the bar." "I am the Willy Wonka of the cocktail mixers," boasts Ellen Fee, who conjures up the new flavours. "I like to think in terms of what flavour is already bitter. Cocoa powder is bitter, cranberry is bitter. You add to that and make it more interesting." The plethora of these cocktail tinctures and potions shows the tastes of aficionados have shifted. But there are other flagbearers for a more bitter palate. Many James Bond fans attempt to recreate the Vesper Martini from Casino Royale. Bond asks for it to be made with strong gin, vodka and the bitter Kina Lillet. Lillet took out much of the bitter quinine in the 1980s and fans tend to use Cocchi Americano Italian vermouth instead. And the Queen has followed in her mother's footsteps by drinking gin and Dubonnet - the quinine-bittered French aperitif. Just a few years ago, her choice was seen as unusual. Now she's part of an established trend. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>The Guardian digests the latest US spying revelations. It gives details of the memo, leaked by the former intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, that suggests the phone conversations of 35 world leaders were monitored. According to the paper, the document acknowledges that the eavesdropping produced "little reportable intelligence". The Guardian says any intelligence benefit to the US is being far outweighed by the potential diplomatic damage. Not everyone is sympathetic towards the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, who has complained about her phone being monitored. Spy expert Nigel West, writing in the Daily Telegraph, questions whether she protests too much. He argues that she cannot pretend to be surprised because she will have authorised similar operations herself. The Financial Times expresses support for European measures designed to prevent US internet companies from being complicit in government snooping. It argues that "freedom from unwarranted surveillance should not be a privilege enjoyed by American citizens alone". The Daily Express leads with the decision of the Portuguese police to re-open its inquiry into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, claiming "vital clues" have been found. The Daily Mirror also puts the story on its front page, reporting that detectives are searching for a gang of five people. There is a warning in the Times that the plan to replace thousands of full-time soldiers with Army reservists may have to be reversed. It comes from former Defence Secretary Liam Fox. He believes it will become more difficult to recruit and retain them as the economy recovers. But the Ministry of Defence says it is committed to the plan, insisting there is no evidence it would be threatened by economic growth. The papers give an insight into the thinking of Prince Charles, drawing on a profile being published in Time magazine. The story forms the lead for the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph which both claim that Charles fears he will no longer be able to pursue those things he believes in once he becomes king. The Times says the prince sees his life's work in what he is doing now - championing causes such as sustainability and traditional architecture. According to the Telegraph, the prince thinks his environmental campaigns will benefit future generations such as that of his own grandson, Prince George. Almost all the papers carry the tale of Tracy Kenny who has claimed £100,000 worth of benefits over the course of 20 years because, she says, she is allergic to shoes. The former baker, who is 45 and from Eccles near Manchester, has now been ruled fit for work by the Department for Work and Pensions - and told that her employment support benefit will be withdrawn. It is reported that she suffers from contact dermatitis - a type of eczema that causes red, itchy skin. She says she can only wear shoes for 15 minutes before her feet blister and she questions how she can go to job interviews with no shoes on. The Daily Express thinks the benefit cut is right, arguing taxpayers should not have to support her. But the National Eczema Society says many people do not understand how painful severe eczema can be. </body>

      <body>Children are being urged to take back their "wild time", swapping 30 minutes of screen use for outdoor activities. The call to renew a connection with nature comes from a collaboration of almost 400 organisations, from playgroups to the NHS. The Wild Network wants children to take up activities like conkers and camping. "The tragic truth is that kids have lost touch with nature and the outdoors in just one generation," said chairman Andy Simpson. The organisers argue that swapping 30 minutes of television and computer games each day for outdoor play would increase the levels of fitness and alertness and improve children's well-being "Time spent outdoors is down, roaming ranges have fallen drastically, activity levels are declining and the ability to identify common species has been lost," said Mr Simpson. He referred to recent research by the RSPB which suggested only one in five children aged eight to 12 had a connection with nature. "With many more parents becoming concerned about the dominance of screen time in their children's lives, and growing scientific evidence that a decline in active time is bad news for the health and happiness of our children, we all need to become marketing directors for nature," said Mr Simpson. "An extra 30 minutes of wild time every day for all under 12-year-olds in the UK would be the equivalent of just three months of their childhood spent outdoors. "We want parents to see what this magical wonder product does for their kids' development, independence and creativity, by giving wild time a go." The campaign launches on Friday with the release of a documentary film, Project Wild Thing. It tells the story of how, in a bid to get his daughter and son outside, film-maker David Bond appoints himself marketing director for nature, working with branding and outdoor experts to develop a campaign. "I wanted to understand why my children's childhood is so different from mine, whether this matters and, if it does, what I can do about it," said Mr Bond. "The reasons why kids, whether they live in cities or the countryside, have become disconnected from nature and the outdoors are complex. "Project Wild Thing isn't some misty-eyed nostalgia for the past. We need to make more space for wild time in children's daily routine, freeing this generation of kids to have the sort of experiences that many of us took for granted. "It's all about finding wildness on your doorstep and discovering the sights, sounds and smells of nature, whether in a back garden, local park or green space at the end of the road." The campaign, said to be the biggest ever aiming to reconnect children with the outdoors, includes the National Trust, the RSPB, Play England and the NHS, as well as playgroups, businesses and schools. </body>

      <body>The chair of governors of the under-fire Al-Madinah Muslim free school has announced she is stepping down. Ofsted inspectors had described the school in Derby as "dysfunctional" and rated it inadequate in every category. The inspection had been brought forward by the agency after fears were raised about teaching standards. Shazia Parveen said she would step down at the "end of a period of transition" and acknowledged the weaknesses identified by Ofsted. In a statement, she said: "The future of our children starts now." The Ofsted report, published on 17 October, said the school required special measures and that the teachers were inexperienced and had not been provided with proper training. Al-Madinah Education Trust said it accepted the report and would use it to move forward. Ms Parveen said in her statement: "Over the last few years, I have sacrificed my own time, family and health for this noble cause - to help educate the children of our communities. "The future of our children starts now. Much has been said about our school. We, the governing body, have tried our best. "We acknowledge the weaknesses within our school and have taken the Department for Education (DfE) recommendations very seriously. "I plan to step down from my position as chair of the governing body as soon as the transition is over and this is clearly for the best interests of our children. "In conclusion, we are ready to learn from our mistakes but not willing to fail our students." A Dfe spokesman said: "We were already investigating this school before allegations became public. We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection." Labour's shadow schools minister Kevin Brennan MP said following reports of Ms Parveen's resignation: "Another day, another episode in David Cameron's flailing flagship education programme. "Al-Madinah is a symbol of all that is wrong with Cameron's free schools. "Labour has long warned of the dangers: a lack of oversight, allowing unqualified teachers to teach on a permanent basis, and spending on free schools ahead of addressing the chronic shortages in primary school places." Mr Cameron had said the Derby school should not be used "as a stick with which to beat the whole free school movement". He added there were many free schools that had on average more outstanding and good ratings than established schools. The Ofsted report followed a letter to the Trust on 8 October by Education Minster Lord Nash that laid out 17 issues. These included forcing female teachers to cover their hair and failing to carry out background checks on staff. He said funding would be pulled if urgent steps had not been taken within seven days. However, the trustees now have to provide an action plan to show how fit they are to run the school, and how it will improve, by 1 November. </body>

      <title>New fears over university pensions</title>
      <description>A massive shortfall in a pensions scheme used by UK university staff is even worse than thought, analysis for BBC Newsnight suggests.</description>

      <body>A massive shortfall in a pensions scheme used by UK university staff is even worse than thought, analysis for the BBC's Newsnight has suggested. In its status report this month the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) put its fund deficit at £7.9bn. But the analysis methods that private companies use put it at £10.5bn. There are concerns that such a significant hole in what is the biggest pension fund in the country could lead to a rise in tuition fees for students. The Universities Superannuation Scheme, with 303,000 members, has assets of £37.9bn - more than three times what taxpayers spend every year on higher education. By its own official estimate to members this month, that is £7.9bn short of what it needs to pay pensions. Those numbers are disputed by the fund's critics who say that working it out on the formula private companies use - known as FRS17 - would put it at £2.6bn higher. Analysis for Newsnight by pensions consultant John Ralfe, former finance director of Boots, showed that to make good that deficit over 20 years would require a nearly doubling of contributions to £1.8bn. That equates to a rise in tuition fees of up to £1,000 a year. Mr Ralfe said: "There is a whole degree of denial. USS is in denial about its real financial situation. Universities are in denial. "We have seen private member schemes closing to new members and existing members wholesale over the last few years. "There will be repercussions for the university sector. All we're doing is bequeathing a very real problem to our children." Higher Education Minister David Willetts told Newsnight it would be wrong to pass on the cost of higher pensions to students. "Universities are independent autonomous bodies and they know one of their financial responsibilities is to stand behind their pensions and tackle their deficits," he said. "It would be wrong to expect students to bail out pension deficits to support pension schemes that are far more generous than students are likely to enjoy when they're older." Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the umbrella body Universities UK, said there was no question that tuition fees would be used to address the pension fund shortfall. "Employers have already taken significant steps to address the fund deficit and will continue to work on long term solutions to ensure that USS remains sustainable and affordable. "The range of challenges facing the fund are not exclusive to USS and impact on all pension schemes. "There is no suggestion that tuition fees will be increased to plug the USS funding shortfalls. This will not feature in any of the considered options to deal with this deficit." Prof Craig Calhoun, director of the London School of Economics, said the size of the scheme's black hole concerned him. "It's very worrying now and it looks even more worrying for the future," he said. "It would be an added cost that we would have to cover either from tuition fees or some other source, either philanthropy or earnings from consulting or other enterprises." Bill Galvin, chief executive of USS, told the Newsnight programme that higher contributions or cuts to benefits had to be considered. He said: "It's been done in 2008. It's been done in 2011. We're looking at it again now." The likelihood of higher tuition fees runs alongside the prospect of university staff having to pay more for their pensions. Under a landmark agreement with universities, university staff have to share any large increases in costs with their employers. They are already in militant mood, with strikes planned next week over pay. </body>

      <title>New 11-plus to combat tutoring</title>
      <description>A new-style 11-plus test is to be introduced in Kent to make it more difficult for wealthier families to coach their children to pass.</description>

      <body>A new 11-plus test is to be introduced in Kent to make it more difficult for families to coach their children to pass. Kent County Council (KCC) said that from September 2014 the test would be a "more sophisticated" assessment. It follows concerns about wealthier families paying for coaching, giving their children a perceived better chance of getting into grammar school. The new test will be varied from year to year to make it less predictable. KCC has said it is looking for better social mobility, allowing more children from all walks of life to get into grammar schools. The test will continue to be provided by GL Assessment, which has run the Kent Test for many years. Independent education adviser Peter Read said the changes would make tutoring less effective. "The first paper will contain verbal and non verbal reasoning as has happened before but it will have elements of each and they will vary from year to year, so [will] be less predictable," he said. Children will no longer be expected to take separate practice papers. Instead, practice exercises will be incorporated into the main papers. There will be two main multiple choice tests, one assessing reasoning ability and one assessing pupils' attainment in literacy and numeracy. All candidates will complete a writing task under test conditions, which happens currently. This will not be marked, but will be available to head teacher panels who can look at borderline cases at the request of the primary school. The new writing task will be shorter than at present, so that all the assignments can be completed on one day. Parents whose children expect to take the tests next year will be able to get more information in May. </body>

      <title>'Devastating' college cuts warning</title>
      <description>Cuts to further education budgets in Wales are "short-sighted" and could damage life-long learning, say teaching unions and charities.</description>

      <body>Cuts to further education (FE) budgets in Wales are "short-sighted" and could damage life-long learning, say teaching unions and charities. The Welsh government is proposing £44.9m of cuts in the FE sector next year and a further £42.5m the following year. The ATL teaching union said there would be a "devastating" impact. The Welsh government said it would work closely with colleges "to minimise the impact of any reductions on learning". Most of the proposed cuts will fall on post-19 further education, which is losing almost a quarter of a £160m budget. "We're talking about very positive things here, about courses which help with the difficult to reach, which help the Neets (not in education, employment or training), those who have been out of work for a long time, courses which help people to upskill and get better jobs," said Dr Phil Dixon from the ATL union. "And I think if those go, then a lot of people in the sector will be very demoralised." His concerns have been echoed by the University and College Union (UCU), which said colleges would struggle to deliver the level of services needed in Wales if the cuts went ahead. "The FE sector is a key player that should not be ignored," said a UCU spokesperson. "It provides a lifeline for many adults who want a second chance at education, enabling them to improve opportunities for themselves and therefore their children. "If reducing child poverty is a top priority for the Welsh government, the role that FE can play in this needs to be taken seriously and funded accordingly." Last year there were almost 250,000 learners in FE colleges in Wales, with three-quarters over the age of 19 and many studying part time. The colleges provide courses on a huge range of subjects including everything from basket weaving and brick laying to advanced manufacturing and engineering. Many of the courses are vocational but academic qualifications are also offered. The Welsh government's own analysis said the cuts would have a disproportionate impact on women, who are more likely to be adult learners, as well as those from an ethnic minority background. It also said it would make it more difficult for those who are out of work to re-train. The National Institute of Adult Continuing Education in Wales (NIACE) charity, said there were "wider benefits" in adult learning and now was not a time to cut the budget. "The effect of the cuts will be a reduction of the number of adult learners in Wales and NIACE Dysgu Cymru would advocate that at such a difficult time, we should be maintaining or even increasing funding for life-long learning for all sorts of reasons," said Essex Havard from NIACE. "There is a lot of research around the area of being an active learner and being a healthy adult, particularly in the area around mental health issues... adult learning can help people to get on with their lives after trauma, for example. "So these are the things we'd want to talk to the Welsh government about - about the wider benefits of adult learning, and of the wider impact of those cuts on the adult learning and life-long education budget." The Welsh government has protected provision aimed at 16-19 year olds, so post-19 further education will bear the brunt of the cuts. Around £37m is due to be cut from post-19 learning next year, a 23% reduction from its £160m budget. Responding to the criticisms about the cuts, the Welsh government said it had been "open about the stark reality" of the financial challenges being faced. "But as we work through these difficult times, it is ever more important that we focus not just on the resources that are available but how we use them and what we achieve," said a spokesperson. "We will work closely with the post-16 sector to evaluate available options and to minimise the impact of any reductions on learning. "This will be the case for any sector that may be impacted by reductions." </body>

      <title>Immigrants' fortunes vary by country</title>
      <description>How well immigrant children do educationally varies widely depending on the countries they go to, according to a new study.</description>

      <body>How well immigrant children do educationally varies widely depending on the countries they go to, a new study suggests. The research, from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), was based on reading test scores for 15-year-olds. Children from similar backgrounds were found to have achieved different standards. In some cases this was equivalent to a school year, researchers said. Children whose families had travelled from Russia did better if they went to Israel, Finland or Germany and least well if they went to Greece or the Czech Republic, according to the OECD. And pupils from the former Yugoslavia did better in the tests if they had gone to Denmark or Switzerland rather than Luxembourg or Austria. The researchers looked at how close students were to the average reading ability for countries in the OECD - a body whose 34 members include many of the world's most developed nations. They say between 2000 and 2009, across the OECD, the proportion of 15-year-olds with an immigrant background increased from 8% to 10%. And they conclude that immigrant children tend to do better in school systems where there are relatively large immigrant groups and where the newcomers are from as broad a range of socio-economic backgrounds as the group they are joining. The study says in Australia, Canada, Israel and the United States, as many as one in four or one in five students has an immigrant background. And in those countries "all students with similar socio-economic status perform equally well, regardless of whether or not they are immigrants", the report says. "The wide performance differences between students with similar socio-economic status and a common origin suggest that schools and education policy in the host countries influence these students' performance", it concludes. The researchers added: "Some education systems appear to be able to facilitate the integration of immigrant students better than others." Among families emigrating from the UK, reading levels among 15-year-olds were highest for those who had gone to New Zealand. </body>

      <title>Free school head checks scaled back</title>
      <description>Documents leaked to the BBC show ministers agreed to scrap pre-appointment checks on inexperienced free school heads despite warnings from civil servants.</description>

      <body>Checks on inexperienced staff who want to be head teachers at free schools have been scrapped, despite warnings from civil servants. Candidates without headship experience had been required to attend assessment centres to ensure they were "capable" of "setting up and running" a school. It comes as Nick Clegg says all schools should employ qualified teachers - free schools can employ unqualified staff. The government insists it closely monitors all head teacher appointments. But a leaked Department for Education document, seen by the BBC and the Guardian, reveals that civil servants were concerned that a lack of checks may lead to unsuitable candidates, referred to as principal designates, being appointed to run schools. It says: "Without the Principal Designate Assessment Centres some free school projects may appoint inexperienced principal designates who are not suitable which would significantly undermine the success of the school." Free schools, like academies, are different from regular state schools because they are allowed to hire unqualified teachers. (Independent schools can do this too.) Nonetheless the paper shows that ministers, including Secretary of State Michael Gove and David Laws, approved the scrapping of the requirement to attend assessment centres in February this year. They also approved a move to allow free school trusts to arrange their own pre-registration checks with Ofsted. These checks focus mainly on the safety of the building in which the school is to be run, and verify that child protection protocols, for example, have been met. It is the only check that the education inspectorate makes on free schools before they open and is particularly important as free schools are not monitored by local authorities, but are funded with taxpayers' money. After that initial check, Ofsted visit free schools within two years of them opening, as with all new schools. Civil servants writing the document, warn that groups may not arrange a "timely inspection when left to their own devices" and issues may be identified "that can't be resolved ahead of opening". This could lead to the schools not being legally ready to open as scheduled, the paper says. With free schools increasingly appearing on local authority school application forms, it could mean some parents who have picked the school for their child end up severely inconvenienced. Ofsted chief inspector Michael Wilshaw has stressed the need for good school leadership and for teachers who are up to the job. And Mr Gove has reduced the time it takes for school management to sack teachers who are not performing well enough. The scaling back of checks is part of departmental plans to save almost a third of its budget for free schools. However, the document also reveals that at the same time the DfE is planning to save 15% from its young people's and maintained schools groups budget "so that its increasing stock of academies and free schools can be managed". At the same time it is reducing the "financial analysis in support of the free school programme", the document shows. The paper warns: "The risk is that free school proposals will not be subject to financial scrutiny." As part of this the funding, allocation and payment systems are being switched from a face-to-face contact to a more web-based "self-service" system. The revelations come as a number of problems have been emerging at some free schools in recent weeks and months. Two schools, including the Al-Madinah faith school in Derby, were put into special measures to bring them up to scratch. And an unqualified head teacher stepped down from a free school in central London amid claims the governors may have regretted appointing an unqualified candidate. The Department for Education insists free schools are raising standards and said: "Assessment centres did not add value to the process. We undertake due diligence checks and closely monitor all proposed head teacher appointments - including having a representative on the recruitment panel in many cases." A spokesman said: "We have achieved this while maintaining proper scrutiny of free school applications and any suggestion that the process has been weakened is false. "Financial scrutiny of free school applications continues to be carried out by trained DfE staff with advice from financial experts. This allows a better overview of the whole application and approval process." Labour's shadow schools minister Kevin Brennan has now written to Mr Gove calling for him to publish the proposals for savings on free schools in full. He said: "Labour has long warned of the dangers of the free schools programme such as the lack of adequate oversight; the use of unqualified teachers; and their prioritisation ahead of addressing areas that desperately need new school places." Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: "We are clear that head teachers need to have qualified teacher status no matter what the structure of the school. Teaching is a profession with an academic and theoretical foundation as well as the skills and craft gained through experience. "Parents are right to expect their child's teachers will be qualified as an assurance of their ability. Heads also value qualifications when recruiting. This is why we have welcomed Nick Clegg's acknowledgement today that teaching is a skilled profession." </body>

      <body>Record numbers of students have applied to study at Oxford or Cambridge in 2014, the two universities report. Oxford said it had received 17,480 applications for undergraduate places, up from 17,216 on the 2013 deadline. Cambridge said over 16,500 applicants for its courses this year represented a rise of almost 4% on last year. Data from admissions service Ucas also showed a slight rise in applications for medicine, dentistry and veterinary degrees as well as for Oxbridge. Oxford and and Cambridge share an early deadline for applications of 15 October with medicine, dentistry and veterinary courses because they are all heavily oversubscribed. Overall some 58,200 people applied by that date this year, compared with 56,810 last year. Much of the overall increase appears to be driven by applications from overseas. The figures include a 10% rise in applications from outside the European Union, with 11,230 people applying this year, against 10,240 last year. Cambridge attributed the highest number of applications since its records began to "extensive outreach work" and a "high-profile commitment to fair admissions". Mike Sewell, director of admissions for the Cambridge colleges, said: "It is great to see a record number of students who feel confident that they will be competitive applicants to Cambridge. "Cambridge is committed to evidence-based admissions decisions which take into account a student's most recent exam results. "Our applicants know that their applications will be assessed fairly on their track record and that places will be won on academic factors alone". The Ucas data shows 40,740 of the 15 October applications were from the UK, up from 40,600 last year. Applications from England rose from 35,970 in 2013 to 36,120 in 2014. Applications also increased from Wales (up 5%) and Scotland (up 2%) but dropped by 10% in Northern Ireland. This represents the highest number of applications from students in England since 2010. There were also more applications from the European Union, with a 4% rise on 2013, and a 10% rise in the numbers of non-EU applicants. Ucas chief executive Mary Curnock Cook said: "It is encouraging to see that the number of UK applicants for these demanding courses is holding steady, particularly as the young population continues to fall in this group. "The number of international applicants is up by 10%." The application deadline for most other courses and universities is 15 January 2014 </body>

      <description>Fewer five-year-olds meet expected standards in maths and literacy than in other key measures, suggests new data.</description>

      <body>Fewer five-year-olds in England are achieving expected standards in maths and literacy than in other key measures, suggests new data. Some 61% achieved at least the expected level in literacy and 66% in maths, according to data published by the Department for Education (DfE). By contrast, 89% reached the expected level in physical development and 87% in expressive arts and design. The figures are based on simplified measures introduced in September 2012. The first assessments under the new Early Years Foundation Stage Profile were this summer. By the end of the school year in which they turn five, children are expected to be able to write simple stories, lists or letters. Reading ability is judged on measures such as being able to use cues such as pictures to understand basic sentences. In maths children are expected to be able to count to 20 and do simple adding adding and subtracting, as well as solve simple problems with shapes, measurements, time and money. Teachers assessing children at the end of their reception year at school now focus on 17 benchmarks in three prime areas of learning: The previous Early Years Foundation Stage, with 69 measures, had been criticised as too bureaucratic. The new data shows over half (52%) of children achieved a "good" level of development, which is considered to be at least the expected level within the three prime areas as well as the expected standards in literacy and mathematics. There was a substantial disparity between the achievement levels of girls and boys. "Girls outperformed boys in all areas of learning," says the DfE's summary of the findings. Some 60% of girls were assessed as having a good level of development, compared with 44% of boys. In literacy some 69% of girls achieved at least the expected level, compared with 53% of boys. The gap was narrower in mathematics, with 70% of girls achieving the expected level, against 63% of boys. A DfE spokeswoman said the new streamlined profile for the foundation stage "places a stronger emphasis on the areas which are most essential for a child's development and a greater focus on the key skills children need for a good start in life". The spokeswoman said reforms to childcare would help all children, regardless of their background, to get a good start in life. "Our reforms are also focusing on improving the quality of professionals working in the early years, by introducing early years teachers and early years educators into nurseries who will specialise in early childhood development. "Ofsted is introducing a tougher early years inspection framework to improve outcomes, and put a stronger emphasis on the areas which are most essential for a child's development, such as strong communications and a good vocabulary", she added. Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: "Children in the UK already start formal schooling much earlier that in most other countries. "It is quite simply inappropriate to replace the developmental assessments at which teachers are proficient with rigid literacy and numeracy assessments. "What is needed in the early years is a broad approach to move children on in their learning, not a series of tests which could create a sense of failure." </body>

In a speech, the deputy prime minister said experienced staff could join a "pool of top talent" which would be "ready to move" at short notice. He also said free schools and academies must only employ professionally qualified teachers. Labour said voters could not trust what Mr Clegg said on this subject. Mr Clegg told BBC Radio 4 Today's programme that unqualified teachers currently working in schools would not be sacked under his proposals, but would instead be given the opportunity to "seek qualifications while you are teaching". He said the rules would not apply to private schools, which also employ teachers without professional qualifications, because "you pay your fees and you take your choice", but children using taxpayer-funded schools had a right to expect basic standards. Before the coalition relaxed the rules, state-funded schools could only employ teachers on a permanent basis if they had completed teacher training, regardless of their other qualifications or experience. The number of unqualified teachers in free schools and academies has gone up from 2,200 in 2010 to 5,300 last year, according to Education Department figures, although the overall number of unqualified teachers in the state sector as a whole has fallen. In his speech, Mr Clegg announced that, from September next year, the government would create a "programme to get outstanding leaders into the schools that need them the most". The team would be made up of head teachers and deputy heads, with recruitment beginning soon, he said. Parts of the Liberal Democrat leader's speech had been heavily trailed in the media for several days, particularly his expression of differences with the Conservatives over free schools, which are state-funded but autonomous. He acknowledged "differences of opinion, some strongly held", stating that his party wants all schools to follow the national curriculum, guarantee food standards and employ only qualified teachers. He said this "view has sparked quite a bit of excitement this week - and criticism", but added that he wants parents to make their educational choices "safe in the knowledge that there are certain safeguards". Downing Street has taken issue with the Lib Dem position on free schools, saying that, as recently as last week, Lib Dem schools minister David Laws had said he was "100% behind" the policy. But Mr Clegg said: "I am totally unapologetic that the Liberal Democrats have our own ideas." Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: "Nick Clegg will be judged on what he does, not what he says. "Whatever he says about free schools today, the truth is this divisive policy is his - enacted by his Tory-led government because of his help and support." </body>

      <body>A charity has launched a mobile phone app to help teenagers refuse requests for explicit images of themselves. The free app from Childline offers users a choice of what the charity says are "witty responses" to send instead. "Sexting" - the sending of intimate images or videos by mobile phone or online - has become so common "it is considered mundane", the charity says. About six out of 10 of those aged from 12 to 15 are thought to own a smartphone. In a recent NSPCC/ChildLine survey, six out of 10 teenagers said they had been asked for sexual images of themselves. The survey - of 450 people - was self-selecting, but the charity said it reflected the results of other studies. The new app - called Zipit - also offers advice on safe online chatting and on what young people should do if they feel threatened or if an image becomes public. One 17-year-old boy told Childline sexting was "pretty normal" among his friends. "My friends and I talk very openly about our experiences within our relationships, and the sort of things we've sent each other. It seems like everyone's doing it." He said he sometimes got bad reactions to things he sent - but it did not bother him enough to stop. "Someone saw a video message I had sent to a previous girlfriend, took a screen shot and posted it online. They called me a pervert and lots of people I knew saw it. "I was completely devastated and, to be honest, almost suicidal." Peter Liver, from ChildLine, said: "We hope Zipit will give [young people] the tools to defuse the pressure to send, share or collect these images." The charity has also teamed up with the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) to help young people get explicit images of themselves removed from the internet. </body>

      <title>Londoners 'taking university places'</title>
      <description>Young people in the capital are much more likely to go to university than anywhere else in England, a study reports.</description>

      <body>Young people in London are 43% more likely to go to university than their counterparts in the north-east of England, says a report from the Higher Education Funding Council for England. The funding council has published an analysis of changing patterns of young people going to university. It shows a widening regional gap, with Londoners taking an increasingly disproportionate number of places. The gender gap has widened too, with women more likely to go to university. The study from the funding council examines trends in young people entering higher education in England, between 1998-99 and 2011-12. The overall underlying trend is that more young people are going to university, with the proportion of 18-year-olds getting places rising from 30% to 38%. But this is not an even spread. The increase has been much greater among young women, with a current gender gap of 12%, compared with 3% in the late 1990s. This gender gap was even more extreme in the poorest areas, with women 35% more likely to go to university. The gap in university entry between rich and poor remains as wide in this decade as it was in the 1990s, although both groups have increased their numbers. "Young people in the most disadvantaged areas would need to treble their participation rate in order to match the rate of those from the most advantaged areas," says the study, observing that the difference remained "broadly stable". But there had been significant regional shifts. London had the highest levels of participation in 1988-99 and this was even more pronounced by 2011-12. The proportion going to university has risen from 35% to 48%. Schools in the capital have become among the highest performing in the country and a much higher proportion of youngsters go on to university than anywhere else. What makes this particularly striking is that in 1998-99, youngsters in London in poorer "low participation" areas were the least likely in the country to go to university. But by 2011-12 they had gone from the bottom to the top of the regional league table. There are 23% of youngsters in London living in poorer areas now entering university. The lowest level of entry among the most deprived is now in the south-east, previously amongst the highest. The study says that more than half of all the extra disadvantaged entrants brought into higher education across England were from London. The highest level of participation by constituency, Wimbledon, has four times the level of university entry for the lowest, Nottingham North. This more local breakdown showed the highest levels of university entry in south-west and north-west London, with the highest rates of increase clustered around north-east and south-east London. The report highlights the places with the lowest levels of university entry, coastal towns, former industrial towns in the midlands and north, rural areas of the south-west, the east midlands and east of England. Along with Nottingham North, the other lowest individual constituency was Bristol South. In terms of the increase in the young people going to university, the biggest increases in the country were in Barking, Lewisham Deptford, Croydon North, Bermondsey and Greenwich. In contrast, North West Norfolk, Bognor Regis and Copeland in Cumbria saw numbers going into reverse. The lowest regional level of increase over these years was the south-west. Prof Les Ebdon, head of the Office for Fair Access, welcomed the "sustained progress" in increasing participation in higher education. But he said that narrowing the gap between the most and least advantaged would mean early intervention. "This means encouraging children from an early age to think about higher education as an option, supporting teenagers as they make key decisions, and working with employers to reach out to potential mature students." He also warned that the fall in part-time student numbers would have a disproportionate impact on poorer families. Rachel Wenstone, vice-president of the National Union of Students, said: "It's fantastic to see that young people still recognise the value of higher education, but it remains a national embarrassment that where you're from remains such a key factor in whether or not you go on to university." Prof Michael Gunn, chair of Million+, representing new universities, said: "The increase in the number of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds entering higher education is one of the great British success stories of the last 15 years. "This is the result of governments being willing to fund an expansion in university places and widening participation initiatives and modern universities rising to the challenge. Without this commitment and increased investment in schools it is unlikely that any of this would have happened." </body>

      <body>Staff at a school in Gloucestershire that became infested with venomous spiders have denied they overreacted by closing for a day. Pest controllers were called in to fumigate The Dean Academy in the Forest of Dean on Wednesday after false widow spiders were found earlier in the week. Some people have criticised the closure, saying the creature's bite is not serious. A spokesman said the school had taken advice from environmental health. The school's education adviser, Phil Lomax, said: "We haven't overreacted at all. "When there's infestation of any kind in a school building it's important to take careful consideration of risk to health and well-being. "In this particular case, with the advice from environmental health, a quick fumigation allowing the fumes to clear and [get] back to normal was the best solution. "You can't actually know whether some students may be more susceptible to bites, stings from wasps, spiders or any other [bugs] either, so I think we've taken a balanced view here in the best interests of students." Some parents told the BBC they thought it had been wrong for the whole school to be shut while the problem was dealt with. Entomologist Steven Falk said: "[The noble false widow] has got a toxic bite but the bite is on a par with a honey-bee sting. "They're nowhere near as dangerous as the media is making out, so we're a little bit surprised [that the school was closed]." There were no reports of anyone being bitten by the arachnids, and the school reopened as normal on Thursday after Wednesday's fumigation. The false widow (Steatoda nobilis) is about the size of a 50p coin and is the most venomous of the dozen or so species of biting spider known in Britain. Its bite can cause severe swelling, chest pains and tingling of fingers. </body>

      <body>The home of Britain's World War II codebreakers will offer internet safety advice to children when a restoration project finishes next year. The Bletchley Park Trust hopes annual visitor numbers to the site near Milton Keynes will rise to 250,000. Software firm McAfee will be a partner in providing an IT learning zone and cybersecurity exhibition. The trust said it hoped the attractions would inspire the 16,000 children it expected to attend each year. Bletchley Park, which is currently open to visitors with tours and a museum, was the highly secretive site where teams, including the "father of computing" Alan Turing, broke the German Enigma codes. The trust is aiming to complete the work in time for the 70th anniversary of the World War II D-Day invasion of France, next June. The learning zone and security exhibition will be built in a derelict block on the estate. Ian Standen, trust chief executive, said: "The work undertaken at Bletchley made a real difference and helped to change the course of history. "We hope to inspire the next generation of potential codebreakers and cybersecurity experts to keep us safe in the digital world." Gert-Jan Schenk, European president at McAfee, said: "Working with Bletchley Park allows us to make a real impact on the cyber security education of children, not to mention the chance to help commemorate the part Bletchley Park played in the birth of the information age." </body>

      <description>Asia's 'tiger parents' paying a high price for children's future</description>

      <body>Zhang Yang, a bright 18-year old from a rural town in Anhui province in China was accepted to study at a prestigious traditional medicine college in Hefei. But the news was too much for his father Zhang Jiasheng. Zhang's father was partly paralysed after he suffered a stroke two years ago and could no longer work. He feared the family, already in debt to pay for medicines, would not be able to afford his son's tuition fees. As his son headed home to celebrate his success, Zhang Jiasheng killed himself by swallowing pesticide. Zhang's case is an extreme. But East Asian families are spending more and more of their money on securing their children the best possible education. In richer Asian countries such as South Korea and emerging countries like China, "education fever" is forcing families to make choices, sometimes dramatic ones, to afford the bills. There are families selling their apartments to raise the funds to send their children to study overseas. Andrew Kipnis, an anthropologist at Australian National University and author of a recent book on the intense desire for education in China, says the amount spent on education is "becoming extreme". It is not just middle-class families. Workers also want their children to do better than themselves and see education as the only means of ensuring social mobility. Some go deep into debt. "Families are spending less on other things. There are many cases of rural parents not buying healthcare that their doctors urge on them... Part of the reason is that they would rather spend the money on their children's education," said Mr Kipnis. "Parents may be forced to put off building a new house, which they might have been able to do otherwise," said Mr Kipnis who did the bulk of his research in Zouping district in Shandong province, among both middle-class and rural households. "It can be very intense. They often borrow from relatives. Of course some people have difficulty paying it back," said Mr Kipnis. A Euromonitor survey found that per capita annual disposable income in China rose by 63.3% in the five years to 2012, yet consumer expenditure on education rose by almost 94%. It's not just the parents' incomes. Educating a child has become an extended-family project. "It goes beyond tiger mothers, it also includes tiger grandmothers and grandfathers," said Todd Maurer, an expert on education in Asia and partner at the consultancy firm, Sinica Advisors. There is evidence of high levels of education spending in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Spending is also increasing in India and Indonesia. In South Korea, where the government believes "education obsession" is damaging society, family expenditure on education has helped push household debt to record levels. According to the LG Economic Research Institute, 28% of South Korean households cannot afford monthly loan repayments, and are hard pressed to live off their incomes. A huge proportion of that income - 70% of Korean household expenditure, according to estimates by the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul, goes toward private education, to get an educational edge over other families. Families cut back on other household spending "across the board," said Michael Seth, professor of Korean history at James Madison University in the US and author of a book on South Korea's education zeal. "There is less money to spend on other things like housing, retirement, or vacations." "Every developing country in Asia, specially China, seems to have a similar pattern," said Prof Seth. A highly competitive examination system and rising aspirations are often blamed. "The Korean education system puts enormous pressure on children," said Prof Seth." The only way to opt out of the system is not to have children. It is so expensive to educate a child that it is undoubtedly a factor in South Korea's very low birth rate," he said. The education obsession is so all consuming that the South Korean government has unsuccessfully tried to curb it, concerned about family spending on extra-curricular lessons and cram schools for ferociously competitive exams. While not yet at South Korean levels, China's education fever also puts pressure on family spending. A recent survey by market research company Mintel, found that nine out of 10 children from middle class families in China attended fee-charging after-school activities. Parents believe these activities will help their children when it comes to university entry. Children are being tutored for longer, starting younger. Where before it was for a year or two before the university entrance exam, now it can start in middle school or even primary. Matthew Crabbe, Asia research director at Mintel, says that people in China are using the savings that might have been put aside for healthcare. "But because the cost of education has risen and the competition for places at good universities have become so much more intense, they are investing more of their savings to make sure the child can get the grades they would need to get in." It does not stop there. Nearly 87% of Chinese parents said they were willing to fund study abroad. In the past an overseas education was confined to the most privileged. Now many more want foreign degrees to give them a shortcut to success. According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a third of Chinese students studying abroad in 2010 were from working-class families. This is a massive financial burden and parents may not realise the true costs. According to Zhang Jianbai who runs a private school in Yunnan province, parents in small provincial cities often sell their apartments to fund their children's study overseas. "Parents decide very early on that their children are going to go abroad and that requires quite a bit of money because [the preparation] cannot be acquired through the public education system," said Mr Maurer. It can include intensive English lessons, study tours to the US and significant payments for student recruitment agents. Last year an estimated 40,000 Chinese students travelled to Hong Kong to take the US college admissions exam, the Scholastic Assessment Test (SATS), which is not offered in mainland China. Chinese education company, New Oriental Education, organises SAT trips to Hong Kong for $1,000 (£627) on average, and parents spend up to $8,000 (£5,020) on tutoring. Once confined to affluent Beijing and Shanghai, it is an expanding market. The company expects its revenue to grow by over 40% in China's second and third tier cities. "Parents are surrendering their last resources to wager them on a child's future by sending them abroad," said Lao Kaisheng, an education policy researcher at Capital Normal University in Beijing. It means that when young people graduate there is great pressure on them to start earning. This is particularly an issue as record numbers of students graduate, seven million this year, and an overseas degree no longer has the status it had in the past. Many graduates languish in non-graduate jobs. But it is not easy to dampen education fever. In South Korea as in other East Asian countries, "it is deeply embedded in the culture. It's also based on reality that there is no alternative pathway to success or a good career other than a prestige degree, this was true 50 years ago, and it's just as true today". "As long as that's the case it's actually rational for parents to spend so much and put so much pressure on their children," said Prof Seth. </body>

      <title>Teachers in China 'highest status'</title>
      <description>Teachers in China are the most highly respected, in an international study comparing the status of teachers in 21 countries.</description>

      <body>Teachers in China have the highest levels of public respect, according to an international study comparing their status in 21 countries. Teachers in the UK were in 10th place in the global index which was compiled by the University of Sussex professor Peter Dolton. The study was based on surveys of 1,000 adults in each of the countries. This examined public attitudes to professional status, trust, pay and the desirability of teaching as a career. The study confirmed the high status of teachers in China, where there is a strong cultural emphasis on the importance of education. "Teachers are revered," says Prof Dolton. A large majority of adults in China believed that students would respect their teachers - in contrast to most European countries where only a minority believed that students would show respect. In the UK, only about one in five adults believed that students showed their teachers respect in school. And while teachers in China were compared with doctors, in the UK they were more likely to be bracketed with nurses and social workers. In the US, people compared teachers with librarians and in Japan the feeling was that they were on a par with local government officials. This reveals the cultural differences in how the role of teaching is perceived, says Prof Dolton, a professor of economics at Sussex University and senior research fellow at the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. The status of teachers in China was considerably above the next highest countries, which were Greece, Turkey and South Korea. The study, published by the Varkey GEMS Foundation, also included some results that might be thought of as unexpected. Finland, often seen as a model for recruiting high-quality, high-status teachers, was in the bottom half of the rankings, in 13th place. while Germany (16th) and Japan (17th) were ranked among the lowest countries. No countries from sub-Saharan Africa were included in the survey. The findings for the UK are based on a single national figure, rather than individual devolved administrations. They show a positive picture in public attitudes, with much higher levels of trust in the education system than in the US and most other European countries in the survey. There was a considerable level of public support for teachers - with a majority believing that they should be better paid and also underestimating the starting salary for teachers (currently about £22,000 in England outside London). More people thought that teachers' unions should have greater influence, compared with those who thought that they had too much influence. But a large majority were sympathetic to the principle of performance pay for teachers. Head teachers in the UK are particularly highly respected - more so than in any other of the countries surveyed. Former education minister, Lord Adonis, said the rankings showed the importance of the role of teaching in education reform. "To recruit the brightest and best, teaching needs to be a high status occupation, and we need to understand better what contributes to the social standing of teachers," said Lord Adonis. Sunny Varkey, founder of the Varkey GEMS Foundation, said: "It is my ambition that teachers are treated with as much respect as doctors. Sadly, in many countries around the world teachers no longer retain the elevated status that we used to take for granted." Prof Dalton says the public status of teaching will influence standards of education. "This informs who decides to become a teacher in each country, how they are respected and how they are financially rewarded. Ultimately, this affects the kind of job they do in teaching our children," he says. </body>

      <title>Stones and apples thrown at university reformer</title>
      <description>The tough struggle to modernise Kurdistan's education system</description>

      <body>Prof Dlawer Ala'Aldeen had tomatoes, stones and apples thrown at him. He faced countless demonstrations. The reason for this hostility, facing the microbiologist from the University of Nottingham, was his controversial attempt to reform the university system in his birthplace of Kurdistan. Prof Ala'Aldeen was the architect of plans to improve the quality and to internationalise higher education in Iraqi Kurdistan. He says he was up against "deeply entrenched interests, people, institutions and long stagnant cultures". The region, autonomous for two decades in the wake of the Gulf War, had inherited a post-Saddam university system that Prof Ala'Aldeen has described as "grossly outdated" and designed for a closed, centralised country. In 2009 Prof Ala'Aldeen was given a secondment away from his job as professor of clinical microbiology at Nottingham University in the UK. He stepped from academic life in the English midlands into the role of Kurdistan's higher education minister, a post he held until last year. Prime Minister Barham Salih, a good friend, chose him for his knowledge of the higher education system and the series of critical articles on education and governance he had written in the years up to his appointment. Barham Salih's election manifesto had included significant support for higher education and training to support Kurdistan's large population of under 20 year olds. There were already plans for more scholarships to send talented students to study overseas. Within a week of being appointed, Prof Ala'Aldeen had written up a radical vision document and it was quickly endorsed by the cabinet. Higher education in Kurdistan was suffering a major crisis of quality, capacity and infrastructure. There was a consensus in support of reform and it helped that Prof Ala'Aldeen had been very critical of the government in the past. The reforms, which planned to improve the quality and accreditation of university teachers, brought considerable opposition from student and teacher organisations as well as businesses linked with the burgeoning market in private universities. Several new private universities were threatened with closure, much to the anger of their staff and prospective students who had paid fees for their courses. "Many teachers had been licensed prematurely. There were 11 private universities when I started with 18 more waiting to be opened. These mushrooming private colleges were relying on the same pool of resources as the public universities which lacked staff and facilities," Prof Ala'Aldeen says. The problem of staffing was particularly acute in medicine, pharmacy and dentistry and in postgraduate studies. But Prof Ala'Aldeen faced protests and opposition. He was accused of trying to transplant the UK system onto Kurdistan, something he vehemently denies since he was educated and worked in his home region, before coming to study in the UK. "I knew the system from the inside and studied what had happened in similar countries. I wanted to apply international principles of quality, but tailor-made to Kurdish traditions," he says. He responded by redoubling his efforts to communicate the purpose of the reforms, which also included curriculum development, moving beyond a single teacher delivering a lecture to a class, the introduction of an electronic admissions system and reforming the teaching of PhDs. In the end, the government closed three private universities as well as five health-related colleges, three pharmacy colleges and two dentistry ones. "If we had allowed the system to keep evolving as it was it would have taken at least a generation to fix it - a generation would have been wasted. We knew we had to act fast. It was a risky policy, but it would have been far riskier to do nothing," he says. The speed of his action was criticised as were aspects of the efforts to improve teaching standards, such as student feedback being used to measure teacher performance and pay. There was also opposition to teachers being asked to engage in professional development once a week. Prof Brendan O'Leary, director of the programme in ethnic conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a longer process might have worked better. But he says it was against a background when unprecedented changes were happening in Kurdish society as the region opened up to foreign investment. "The Kurdistan region is going through a difficult and fast-paced transformation. "Ideally a long and rich discussion is needed to agree new institutional conditions to enable higher education to flourish in a region emerging from decades of destruction, war, genocide, internal fighting, academic isolation and lack of resources. "University and institutional reforms are more likely to succeed if all the stakeholders have clear ideas on what to do, when, and at what pace. One should not be surprised if people with vested interests fear reforms," said Prof O'Leary. Thomas Hill, assistant professor at New York University Center for Global Affairs, adds: "I do not believe there is consensus even now that the reforms the former minister wanted to implement would have been in the best interest of the Kurdistan region. "There are many, many people with very conservative views within the higher education sector in the Kurdistan region and many did not and do not like the progressive path the former minister was plotting." There were areas in which vested interests remained unmoved. Prof Ala'Aldeen could not increase the independence of universities. The government continues to choose university leaders and universities have been totally dependent on government funding. Prof Ala'Aldeen put together draft legislation on institutional autonomy, but says the challenge to the status quo was too great to push it through. He is in close touch with the current government and is pleased that the reforms to improve quality have been maintained, despite the fact that there is still not consensus in favour of them, and says the scholarship programme is already making a difference. "Almost 3,000 students have studied abroad, the majority in the UK. Half of these are or will be back by the end of this year. They will provide leadership and bring a breath of fresh air. They will link their institutions to the outside world and break Kurdistan's academic isolation." Although Kurdistan has its own particular circumstances, Prof Ala'Aldeen says that the problems facing the university system are not unique - and that the model for modernisation could be applied elsewhere in the Middle East. "The problems are generic and the solutions can be implemented anywhere in the world." Commentators on Kurdistan's politics agree. Prof O'Leary says: "The Kurdistan region, Iraq and several other states in the Middle East are going through dramatic changes, and in some cases, deeply regrettable authoritarian restorations. "Most institutions are highly politicised in these societies. If the Kurdistan region can successfully reform its education system, including higher education, it can provide a model for the wider Middle East." </body>

      <body>Keep up, keep up. If you've only just caught on to the concept of online university courses called Moocs, then you're in danger of falling behind again. Harvard, one of the world's most influential universities, is moving on to Spocs - which stands for small private online courses. Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go". And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc". Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up. Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection. But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered. Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts. The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted. It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses. At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds? Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands. It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits. Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model. Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students. Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials. Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information". These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work. Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus. It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences. Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX. He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility". And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution". "The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era." "What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue. It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications? The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says. "It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area." There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning. A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs. The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue". The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time. Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus. "What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?" If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"? Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective. Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests. "The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better." "Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem." </body>

      <title>UK enters online university race</title>
      <description>The UK's biggest online university project is being launched, with a partnership of more than 20 universities offering free courses.</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses. Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers. The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses. It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts. Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar". He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas. The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet. The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project. The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students. There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year. In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications. But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them. It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options. When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations. FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution. They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students. Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront". But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs. Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming. "Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor. "Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities. "Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study." Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course. FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting. He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture". This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content. This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University. "Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean. There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England. Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford. Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities. These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates. It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online. These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams. Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard. On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses. But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses. Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT. He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online. Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance. "The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow. "The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system." Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets." </body>

      <title>Gordon Brown's Syrian refugee school plan</title>
      <description>Syria's refugee crisis is also threatening to become a long-term education disaster.</description>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks. "A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon. As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school. Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks. It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school. But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (£319m). The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy. This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds. Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived. The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes. Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population. But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling. The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war. Forty years ago Médecins Sans Frontières established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones. Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief. Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations. Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence. On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees. In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds. It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world." </body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>

      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education? In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show. This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead. Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course. Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show. A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics". Showbiz lessons The show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience". She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show". The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids. It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive. This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week. Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education. And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning. Dumbing down? This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection. There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time. But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus? "When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university. "The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show." Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples. "In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course." Apocalypse studies Josh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show. "This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental." "This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters." Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning? "Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says. He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet. "The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says. Personal learning For the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online. "The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble. "The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that." These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students. Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities. But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected. William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs. And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate. They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says. Spoiler alert Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses. Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary. "The student must be able to sift the evidence. "For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says. Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment. But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected. With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert. </body>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied. The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies. There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea. The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place. This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies. One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard. This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone. This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (£20bn' 23.5bn euro). But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings. Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique. It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo. Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe. In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place. But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities. Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin. Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart. </body>

      <title>The scientists who escaped the Nazis</title>
      <description>A first-hand memory of the scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany</description>

      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority. The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel. They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history. Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research. The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers. Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule. He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics. Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis? "Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months." Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him. There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav. The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more". It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating. "They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way." When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders. "My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey." While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain. The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics. It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain. It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman. Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933. He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil. "It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people." He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living". The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs. This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy. According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939. Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard. There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him. Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort. In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won. Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen. There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake. In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen. Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls. But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue. Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism. What lessons should be learned from all this? Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year. It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions". There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said. The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world. But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve. His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society. His father, remembered for his science research, played Bach on the piano every day. These were internationalists, their ideas and research moving across national and political boundaries. Such a world proved fragile in the face of the Nazis. And Gustav Born says people can too often overlook that Germany had still been a young country in the 1930s, little more than 60 years old, and that it hadn't built the institutions able to resist its own "militaristic and nationalistic" tendencies. He is very much aware that he is now one of the few remaining people who can talk first-hand about such a legacy. "I'm sad that it almost ends with me. "I want them not to forget that things like this, the suppression of a country by a gang of murderous crooks and the victimisation of people of good nature and good intention, it could happen again." </body>

      <title>Education is a 'security issue', says UN</title>
      <description>Unesco chief says even though pledge for education for all will be missed, huge progress has been achieved.</description>

      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says. Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school. The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education. But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success. In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling. After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely. "By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco. But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million. "If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%." Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom. Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate. So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova. It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places. Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding. In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers. But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance. Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments. "Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism. "The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society." The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says. Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general. "Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis. "But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking. "We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education." Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls. Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls. Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem. "One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says. "It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn." And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal. "It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy. "There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect. "This is the best thing that could happen to humanity." The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute. A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school. It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong. A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict. In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls. In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed. The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students. Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed. Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward. This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results". But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school. It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow. "In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument." </body>

      <body>A new branch of thought, Becksistentialism, will be brought before the public by Cambridge University this week. David Beckham's imagined philosophical awakening during his time with Paris Saint Germain will be highlighted during the Cambridge Festival of Ideas. For its inventor Dr Andy Martin, Becksistentialism is "existentialism but with a very cool haircut". The lecture will be based on Dr Martin's blog, Becks in Paris. The blog "imagines Beckham's internal monologue as he collides with the Parisian intellectual tradition - the glittering surface of a footballing icon cracked open by existentialism. Golden boy deconstructed." Dr Martin, a lecturer in French philosophy at Cambridge University, began writing it after the former England star signed with Paris Saint Germain on a five-month deal before retiring from the game in May. Beckham was reaching a turning point, reasoned Dr Martin. Would he succumb to ideas of existentialist angst, meaninglessness and absurdity as defined by great French writers such as Sartre? Or would he find "the best of all possible worlds" like Voltaire's Candide? "I found myself identifying with Beckham, having lived myself in Paris in bygone days. As an east Londoner and having once captained a regional amateur team, I always felt if I hadn't got into philosophy I could have been a footballer," he told BBC News. "I could imagine myself living the life he was living in Paris. "It is impossible for a reasonably intelligent guy like Beckham not to have had some sort of revelatory encounter while he was there." Dr Martin says links between philosophy and football go beyond the personal. "Derrida used to follow Paris Saint Germain. "Philosophy aspires to the condition of football." He points out that Albert Camus, author of The Outsider and The Plague, once played in goal and that 2013 is the centenary of his birth. "Philosophy came to him as a kind of substitute when he was forced to give up football by tuberculosis. "Being an existentialist is normal. "It gives you a guide to life and a way to understand how you have screwed up. "Everything always goes wrong - and if you think about the England football team over the past few decades you can hardly disagree." He imagines the crises that Beckham may have been through during his football career, starting with his sending off during the 1998 World Cup: "I was at that game." Dr Martin regards the midfielder "as an exemplar or embodiment of a number of philosophical propositions" about crisis, conflict and identity. "The thing about Beckham is that he doesn't say much so you have to be a subtle interpreter of signs. "He has this ability to reinvent himself time and again - and every time he pops up his hair is different - a signal of his mutability. "My basic hypothesis to get into the soul of Beckham is to echo Descartes and to think that he thinks. "He couldn't be seen carrying a book as that would shatter his image but maybe he looked at The Outsider on his phone while he was in Paris." Dr Martin sees Beckham as having taken a similar journey to Voltaire's Candide, who starts out as the ultimate optimist but is forced by life to take a more complex view. "If you look beyond the shiny surface you find complexities which existentialism brings out and dramatises." The lecture, Becksistentialism, is one of 200 events planned for the Festival of Ideas which begins in Cambridge on Wednesday. </body>

      <body>A school was unable to open a time capsule in time for its 50th anniversary because no-one could remember where it was buried. The plastic ice-cream tub was originally placed in the garden of Writtle Junior School, near Chelmsford, 25 years ago. But teachers now think it may have been removed from its original burial place. Headteacher Nick Taylor said the "desperate search" was called off in case they destroyed their garden. The school called in metal detectorists but to no avail. Mr Taylor said: "I think we've dug about three holes around our school garden and we've had to stop because we were slowly destroying it in our desperate search for the capsule." Writtle Junior School decided to mark its 25th anniversary by filling a time capsule which was scheduled to be opened on its 50th anniversary. Pupil Chris Green won the competition to decide the contents of the plastic container which included first and second class stamps, coins, a newspaper and a toy car. It was buried in the school's garden under a slab, engraved with its date. But despite digging "a very, very deep hole", nothing was found under the slab, according to Mr Taylor. However, the garden has been remodelled in recent years and deputy headteacher Sue Evans said she believed the capsule may have been moved at that point. Former pupil Karen Patient was at the school when the capsule was buried. She said: "I have told the the headmaster where I think it was buried but they haven't tried there yet - as far as I remember it was in a different corner, underneath a bench." Mrs Evans said she was sure they would eventually find the capsule if they keep digging, "although our gardening club might not recover". A second time capsule has now been buried to mark the 50th anniversary. Mr Taylor said this time the school would keep very detailed records of its location. </body>

      <title>Call to improve RE lesson standards</title>
      <description>Religious education in schools in England needs to be more consistent, amid concerns the subject is being marginalised.</description>

      <body>Religious education in schools in England needs to be improved, says a group of RE specialists who fear the subject is being marginalised. The report calls for a more structured national framework for the subject and improvements in teacher training. Earlier this month Ofsted warned that more than half of schools were failing to give pupils good RE lessons. Report chairman John Keast says the aim is "securing the future of RE in our schools". The study, published by the Religious Education Council for England and Wales, is an attempt to tackle the "uneven quality" of how the subject is taught in England. The report proposes a curriculum framework which could be used as a "national benchmark". This suggests how pupils should be able to find out about different religions and their beliefs, festivals and symbols. It calls for improvements in how teachers are trained to give them more confidence in the subject. The National Association of Teachers of RE welcomed the idea of a consistent national framework for the subject, which would work in parallel to the revised national curriculum. "It is imperative that, in this tough age for RE, we provide teachers with a curriculum framework of high quality," said RE adviser, Lat Blaylock. The report also suggests that the current GCSE and A-level in religious studies should be reformed. There was controversy when the subject was not included in the GCSEs needed for the English Baccalaureate, with claims that it would lower its importance in secondary schools. Ofsted recently published a strong criticism of how the subject was being taught. The education watchdog said the subject should play "a key role in promoting social cohesion and the virtues of respect and empathy, which are important in our diverse society" but instead "many pupils leave school with scant subject knowledge and understanding". "Some schools boast good and outstanding RE, yet many cannot," said Mr Keast. "In recent years RE has fallen into a vacuum. Falling back on the safety net of statutory provision is not enough to ensure consistent high standards, strong teaching, adequate examination provision and clarity on what the subject covers. "Having a thoroughly reconsidered national curriculum framework is a means of changing both practice and attitudes to RE." "The modern world needs young people who are sufficiently confident in their own beliefs and values that they can respect the religious and cultural differences of others," says Education Secretary Michael Gove, in a foreword to the report. </body>

      <description>An exam body reveals that most A-level grade predictions from schools are incorrect when final results are published</description>

      <body>Most A-level grade predictions made by teachers are incorrect when the final results are published, according to data revealed by an exam body. Predicted grades are an important part of the university application process. Only 48% of predicted grades were correct for pupils taking the OCR exam board's A-levels in summer 2012, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Almost one in 10 of the wrong forecasts, more than 15,000 entries, were incorrect by more than one grade. For this one exam board, there were more than 186,000 incorrect forecasts for that summer's A-levels. These teacher forecasts were gathered by the OCR board in May, a few weeks ahead of the exam season. As such they should have been more accurate than the January predictions used in the university admissions system. The findings could re-ignite questions about the fairness of a prediction-based university application system, before pupils know their results. Although, the exam body says, it means more than 90% of forecasts were correct within a margin of one grade. The A-level statistics published by Cambridge Assessment, OCR's parent body, show that teachers were much more likely to be over-optimistic about results - with 39% over-predicting, compared with 13% whose predictions turned out to be lower than the actual grades. Independent school teachers were the most accurate in predicting the right grade, followed by grammar schools, academies, sixth form colleges and comprehensives. The lowest level of accuracy was for teachers in further education. Predictions from further education colleges, as the least accurate at both ends of the scale, were both the most likely to be over-optimistic and the most likely to be wrongly pessimistic. Independent and grammar schools were the toughest in terms of predictions, with the lowest levels of over-optimism. Teachers were much stronger at predicting the highest grades, A* and A, with more than 60% accuracy. For C-grades, only 47% had been correctly predicted. But the figures also show that over a range of subjects, when a pupil is forecast three A-grades or better, only 35% of these predictions prove to be correct. Oxford University said that there were other factors considered in applications, as well as predicted grades. "We look carefully at a range of factors when considering a student's application, including GCSE scores, aptitude test results, interview performance, teacher reference and Ucas statement, so that we are not reliant on predicted grades to select the very best students," said admissions spokesman, Matt Pickles. </body>

      <description>A woman who almost drowned in a school swimming lesson in Essex 13 years ago wins a landmark case at the Supreme Court.</description>

      <body>A woman who almost drowned in a school swimming lesson 13 years ago has won a landmark case at the Supreme Court. Annie Woodland was a pupil at Whitmore Junior School in Basildon, Essex, when she had to be resuscitated in 2000. She suffered severe brain damage. A claim for £3m damages was rejected in 2011 and that decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal last year. The latest ruling now paves the way for her to pursue compensation from Essex County Council. Her lawyers argue that the county council owed her a duty of care "in the capacity loco parentis" when Miss Woodland, then aged 10, took part in a school swimming lesson at a local pool. The swimming teacher and lifeguard who, it is claimed, negligently failed to notice Miss Woodland had got into difficulties, were not employed by the county council. Lawyers for Miss Woodland, who is now in her early 20s and lives in Blackpool, argued that the school still owed her a duty of care, even when third parties were contracted to provide teaching. When the case was dealt with in the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Tomlinson said the imposition of a non-delegable duty of care on the council could have a chilling effect on the willingness of education authorities to provide valuable experiences for their pupils. The issue before the Supreme Court justices at a hearing in July related to the criteria to be applied in "determining the circumstances in which a school's duty to its pupils under the National Curriculum can be delegated". In his ruling released on Wednesday, Lord Sumption found that the local authority owed a "non-delegable duty of care". "It is fair, just and reasonable to impose such duties," the ruling states. "It is consistent with the long-standing policy of the law to protect those who are inherently vulnerable and subject to a significant degree of control. "It is wholly reasonable that a school should be answerable for the performance of part of its own educational function. "Parents are required by law to entrust their child to a school and have no knowledge or influence over the arrangements that the school may make to delegate specialised functions, or the competence of the delegates." He concluded that if third parties were found to be negligent, Essex County Council would be in breach of a duty of care. Lady Hale said the decision was a "development of the law" and avoided the "unsatisfactory possibility" that one child could sue but another could not. An Essex County Council spokesperson said: "The Supreme Court has changed the law so that a public authority now has liability in certain circumstances for the negligence of its independent contractors where children or vulnerable people are involved." "This overturned the earlier decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal. "However, the question of whether Essex County Council is liable in this case remains to be decided and will be heard by the High Court next year." Miss Woodland's mother, Alison Morris, said she was "greatly relieved that justice has been done". She said: "It should never have come to this in the first place. No child should suffer in this way. This ruling will make such a difference to families in the future." Miss Woodland's father Ian said: "It has caused enormous damage to our family. "Up until this ruling, we had seen only injustice. How could the school not be responsible for our daughter during a National Curriculum lesson? "I hope that, in the light of this judgment, no other family has to go through the same as we have done." </body>

      <title>University sells study-free MBA</title>
      <description>An online university sold a top degree for thousands of pounds with no work required, a BBC Newsnight investigation reveals.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24618786</url>

      <body>A so-called university sold an MBA degree for thousands of pounds with no academic work required, a BBC Newsnight investigation has revealed. The American University of London (AUOL) awarded a fictitious person created by the programme a Master's in Business in exchange for a £4,500 fee. AUOL has insisted it is "not a bogus university" and defended the robustness of the qualifications it offers. Newsnight has found hundreds of senior executives listing AUOL qualifications. The programme contacted some of them, but they all insisted that they had had to study for their degrees. AUOL styles itself as a pioneer of distance learning, offering degrees and post-graduate qualifications in business, IT, law, education and liberal arts, humanities, and English to more than 100,000 students worldwide. Its website claims that that all of their courses "have been designed to the most exacting standards, in accordance with the most stringent criteria, in order to provide outstanding education at an affordable price". However, Newsnight found that getting the university to provide a qualification without any study at all was easy. The programme drew up a one-page fake CV for a management consultant Peter Smith, known as Pete, living in South London, which included 15 years of made-up work experience and a fictitious undergraduate degree from a UK university. The real Pete was actually a dog living in Battersea Dogs' Home. Newsnight sent "Pete's" CV to AUOL, along with a completed application for the Master's in Business (MBA) and £50 application fee. AUOL also requires applicants to provide photocopies of previous qualifications and a photograph of themselves. However, Newsnight was unable to provide either since the qualifications did not exist and the applicant was a dog. Despite these omissions, just four days after sending in the application, AUOL sent "Pete" an e-mail saying that his application for a degree based on previous experience had been successful and that once the university had received his £4,500 fee he would be registered as an MBA graduate within about two weeks. When Newsnight's reporter telephoned to check whether "Pete" would be required to submit any work, a university representative said: "No, no, apparently the APEL [Accreditation of Previous Experiential Learning] board awarded him the full degree immediately based on his qualification and his professional experience, so he doesn't have to do any courses." We showed our written application to Jan Bamford at London Met University which runs properly accredited MBA courses. She was incredulous that a degree could be awarded to someone "with such limited work experience and such a poor application". "I find it incredible that any organisation is awarding an MBA on what essentially amounts to the evidence that is on a piece of paper. That's appalling. Really appalling. And again it goes to the very heart of the fact the government needs to regulate this behaviour," she added. In order to hand out a British degree an institution has to be recognised by Parliament. However, it is perfectly legal to give the impression that a university is run in the UK even when in reality it is incorporated overseas. AUOL is one such place - seemingly based in London, but actually incorporated in St Kitts and Nevis in the Caribbean, as they state on their website. Despite its name, AUOL does not seem to have any physical presence in London. Newsnight found that the university's phone number is a Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, area code and that the bank that university fees are paid to is in Beaconsfield. According to public records, including the electoral roll, Professor Michael Nimier, who was the founder of AUOL, and Sonia Grimes, who is the registrar, live in the town. On its website, AUOL boasts some well qualified supervisors and says that "the university's academic staff are highly qualified and experienced". But when we contacted five Western academics on its list, all said they had never worked there and never agreed for their name to be used. George Gollin, an American academic with expertise in unaccredited education, told Newsnight that AUOL "did not stand up to scrutiny". "It doesn't have authority to award degrees. They are not degrees. They are pieces of paper and I'm guessing they are not able to sell very many degrees into countries where English is the first language." The university says most of its graduates study at independent colleges in countries overseas. Those affiliates are apparently independent with their own staff subject to their own local laws. AUOL simply takes a fee to help set the curricula and issue graduation certificates in its own name. On professional social networking sites Newsnight found hundreds of senior executives who said they had qualifications from AUOL. The programme spoke to a number of them, all of whom insisted that they did have to submit work to get their degrees. Dr Robert Oakes, a psychologist from Birmingham, who gives expert testimony in court cases, was awarded a PhD just five months after first submitting work. However, he told the programme that he had spent 18 months on his own background research prior to this and he was already a registered psychologist based on a previous degree. Dr Oakes said he believed AUOL was properly accredited, but that he has now taken the qualification off his CV. Dr Rita Bowser, a senior nuclear industry executive who was in charge of selling a new generation of reactors in the UK, was awarded a doctorate in business after submitting what she described as "significant amounts of coursework". Her employer, Westinghouse, said she is well qualified for her job based on 30 years of experience and two previous degrees including a master's from the respected Georgia Tech. Since AUOL is not properly accredited it is not possible to verify how much work they did, nor what standard was required. The university has claimed to be recognised by three different American institutions, but these institutions are themselves unofficial and unrecognised. The university is listed as "bogus" by the agency that values degrees for the Italian government and it has been blacklisted in five US states, including Texas where it is illegal to use any of its qualifications to get a job. In a statement AUOL told Newsnight: "We are not a bogus university… and have always been upfront about our status. We have not applied for accreditation with any American, British or other official agency. Many graduates go on to higher education or hold important positions on the strength of our degrees."

      <title>Call for free vitamins for children</title>

      <body>England's chief medical officer has said all children should be offered vitamin supplements to safeguard their health. Currently the NHS offers free vitamins A, C and D to all children under five from low-income families. It has been claimed up to 25% of children are vitamin D deficient, leading to a rise in rickets cases. In her annual report, Prof Dame Sally Davies says extending the scheme would protect more children and save money. But she warned people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of what she says is a "very worrying picture" of children's health. And she said the UK lags behind many other European countries. Under the current scheme, children aged six months to four years are eligible for free vitamins if their parents are on benefits. But Dame Sally said more needed to be done to give children a good start with their health, and acting early would save taxpayers' money. She has asked the medicines watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), to examine the cost-effectiveness of offering vitamins A, C and D to all children under five. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 4's Today programme "Vitamin D deficiency is not just about poverty". She said children with developmental issues due to being born prematurely, those from ethnic minorities as well as children being "covered up" to protect them from the sun thereby missing out on the benefits too, She added: "Children get very locked on to screens and it can be difficult to turf them out into the sunlight. But the sun in the winter doesn't give you as much vitamin D so this is necessary." "This would cost pennies a day and would undoubtedly save money in the long run." She said the giving parents vitamins for their children would "empower" them, giving them an extra boost during the winter months when there is less sunlight. In her report, Dame Sally also called for more research into mental health problems in adolescents. She is calling for a survey of young people's mental health, amid concerns about funding and services. Only 25% of children with clinical mental health disorders receive specialist help within three years. Dame Sally said her annual report - which this year is on child health - questioned whether our society had got the balance right and should act as a wake-up call. She said obesity stood out as one of the big issues, but the report also demonstrated the interplay between health, social environment, emotional environment and education. Some of the statistics, such as five more children aged up to 14 years dying each day of avoidable causes than in Sweden, were "absolutely shocking", she said. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 5 live: "The majority of deaths are in the first year of life, and these relate to prematurity." She said premature births could be reduced by stopping smoking during pregnancy and by improving the health and diet of pregnant women. The chief medical officer's annual report also calls for: National Children's Bureau chief executive Dr Hilary Emery said: "The UK must have greater expectations for children's health if we are to be the best place in the world for children to grow up. "As a nation we must be much more ambitious about giving every child the best start in life, and this should be a priority for all decision makers in central and local government." The report is entitled - Our Children Deserve Better, Prevention Pays. </body>

      <body>Children who are overweight or obese should be encouraged to keep a food-and-activity diary, say new public health guidelines for England. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says more needs to be done to tackle child obesity. It says getting parents and their children to track what they snack on and how much TV they watch could help. Although rates are levelling off, three in every 10 children aged between two and 15 are overweight or obese. The guidelines make a raft of recommendations, including greater support from local authorities, but say families are at the heart of managing the issue. Children from around the age of 12 - depending on their ability - should be encouraged to monitor their eating, physical activity and any sedentary behaviour, say the guidelines. "For example, encourage them to keep a record of time spent watching television or playing computer games, and what they snack on and when, to identify areas that need addressing," says NICE. For younger children, parents and carers should keep tabs. The guidelines also stress the importance of helping parents and carers recognise that their child is overweight. A National Opinion Poll involving more than 1,000 parents of children aged between four and seven showed that only 14% of those with an obese child considered that their child was overweight. Schools already monitor their pupils by measuring and weighing them at around age five when they start primary school and again as they leave at around the age of 11. NICE says all family members need to be on board, regardless of their own weight, to encourage healthy eating patterns and promote physical exercise - by walking to school, for example. Prof Mike Kelly, Director of the Centre for Public Health at NICE, said: "We are recommending family-based lifestyle programmes are provided which give tailored advice. "These programmes will also support parents to identify changes that can be done at home to tackle obesity - and maintained over the long term. Many of them are things we should all be doing anyway, including healthy eating, getting the whole family to be more active and reducing the amount of time spent watching TV and playing computer games. "Being overweight or obese has a significant impact on a child's quality of life. It can affect their self-esteem and they are more likely to be bullied or stigmatised." </body>

      <title>Peek-a-boo: A window on baby's brain</title>
      <description>What a baby's sense of humour can tell us about their brains</description>

      <body>A baby's first smile is an exciting moment. But what can it tell us about their understanding of the world? Boasting about the speed of childhood development is the sport of choice for many a doting parent. From the 12-week scan right through the early years, monitoring the physical and mental progress of their pride and joy is a source of both excitement and concern. Especially rewarding is the onset of smiles, squeals and laughter - the kind of milestones that make all the disturbed nights worth it. But is it all just wind? Apparently not, as researchers now think that laughter and games like peek-a-boo could be telling us something more, and giving us a way to peer inside the workings of their minds. "Laughter and smiles start incredibly early, just like tears," says Dr Caspar Addyman, a baby laughter researcher at Birkbeck College in London. "So this leads us to think that it's a form of communication," he told the BBC. Dr Addyman has collected nearly 700 questionnaires about baby smiles and laughter from around the world. He found that babies are smiling in response to pleasant feelings much earlier than expected, which can be as young as one month old. Soon after that, at between two to four months, social smiles develop that are used specifically to engage the parents. He now hopes to take the research further and use laughter as a new way of tracking what it is that babies understand about the world around them. The person who most greatly influenced our current view of childhood development was Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Careful observations of children at different ages led him to identify four stages that everyone must go through to reach the cognitive abilities of an adult (see box). In the earliest months of life, Piaget said that babies are only able to learn about the world by directly interacting with it through grasping, shaking and sucking. With each experience, he concluded, children gradually build up a picture of how the world works - a kind of naïve physics. But Dr Addyman thinks that studying babies' laughter can be just as effective at helping us pinpoint developments in the way their minds are expanding. "You can't laugh at something until you get the joke, so what they laugh at really tells us about their understanding of the world," says Addyman. As a result of having experienced so little, small children are for the most part quite content to accept the absurd as completely plausible. Dr Addyman, who sports a crop of bright blue hair, sees this regularly with his young volunteers. "Young babies would never laugh at my hair. But older children realise there's something wrong and that makes it funny." The ability of children to suddenly see the funny side, Dr Addyman believes, acts to highlight much more profound developments going on deep inside their brains. The Baby Laughter Project, which has surveyed parents from more than 20 countries, has shown that games like peek-a-boo are perfect for showing one such fundamental development - object permanence. The term describes the understanding that an object still exists, even if you can't see it. Very young children don't know this, which is why babies under around six months can look shocked and startled at peek-a-boo. They think that not being able to see mum or dad's face means that they've actually disappeared, making their sudden reappearance come as quite a surprise. However once a child understands (at around six- to eight-months old) that their parent is just hiding, then peek-a-boo becomes all about the anticipation of when they're going to come back. "Peek a boo is all the best things. It's mummy reappearing, but it's also about shared communication," says Dr Addyman. "You can't help but smile and laugh when a baby starts laughing with you, which is really valuable for them developing their ability to interact with other people." A potential link between laughter and language development suggests we've thus far underestimated babies' sense of humour. Joking requires an element of taking turns as well as other skills needed for advanced interaction, like imitation and eye-contact. "Children can pick up the rhythms of conversation through joking and playing games," says Dr Addyman. In fact, smiles and laughter could be important communication tools for infants before they develop language. Even primates seem to use laughter as a way of regulating social interaction. "Laughter in chimps is predominantly used in play and it tends to be the youngest members of the group who have time for playing," says Dr Katie Slocombe, a primate cognition specialist at the University of York. "It's been shown in chimps that laughter facilitates extended play, and we can't rule out that it has some sort of role in social bonding. When a chimp laughs, it seems to encourage their play partner to continue tickling or chasing them - just like a baby keeping an adult's attention for longer," she told the BBC. So should we try harder to interpret the deeper meaning in those burbles and titters? Dr Addyman suggests a certain level of caution. "Historically, we've certainly been guilty of projecting adult interpretations about what babies are laughing at, and it's a constant danger when doing this kind of research," he says. "You really have to look at this scientifically and at a range of ages to really start to understand what's going on in their heads." </body>

      <body>The music of ancient Greece, unheard for thousands of years, is being brought back to life by Armand D'Angour, a musician and tutor in classics at Oxford University. He describes what his research is discovering. "Suppose that 2,500 years from now all that survived of the Beatles songs were a few of the lyrics, and all that remained of Mozart and Verdi's operas were the words and not the music. Imagine if we could then reconstruct the music, rediscover the instruments that played them, and hear the words once again in their proper setting, how exciting that would be. This is about to happen with the classic texts of ancient Greece. It is often forgotten that the writings at the root of Western literature - the epics of Homer, the love-poems of Sappho, the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides - were all, originally, music. Dating from around 750 to 400 BC, they were composed to be sung in whole or part to the accompaniment of the lyre, reed-pipes, and percussion instruments. But isn't the music lost beyond recovery? The answer is no. The rhythms - perhaps the most important aspect of music - are preserved in the words themselves, in the patterns of long and short syllables. The instruments are known from descriptions, paintings and archaeological remains, which allow us to establish the timbres and range of pitches they produced. And now, new revelations about ancient Greek music have emerged from a few dozen ancient documents inscribed with a vocal notation devised around 450 BC, consisting of alphabetic letters and signs placed above the vowels of the Greek words. The Greeks had worked out the mathematical ratios of musical intervals - an octave is 2:1, a fifth 3:2, a fourth 4:3, and so on. The notation gives an accurate indication of relative pitch: letter A at the top of the scale, for instance, represents a musical note a fifth higher than N halfway down the alphabet. Absolute pitch can be worked out from the vocal ranges required to sing the surviving tunes. While the documents, found on stone in Greece and papyrus in Egypt, have long been known to classicists - some were published as early as 1581 - in recent decades they have been augmented by new finds. Dating from around 300 BC to 300 AD, these fragments offer us a clearer view than ever before of the music of ancient Greece. The research project that I have embarked on, funded by the British Academy, has the aim of bringing this music back to life. But it is important to realise that ancient rhythmical and melodic norms were different from our own. We must set aside our Western preconceptions. A better parallel is non-Western folk traditions, such as those of India and the Middle East. Instrumental practices that derive from ancient Greek traditions still survive in areas of Sardinia and Turkey, and give us an insight into the sounds and techniques that created the experience of music in ancient times. So what did Greek music sound like? Some of the surviving melodies are immediately attractive to a modern ear. One complete piece, inscribed on a marble column and dating from around 200 AD, is a haunting short song of four lines composed by Seikilos. The words of the song may be translated: While you're alive, shine: never let your mood decline. We've a brief span of life to spend: Time necessitates an end. The notation is unequivocal. It marks a regular rhythmic beat, and indicates a very important principle of ancient composition. In ancient Greek the voice went up in pitch on certain syllables and fell on others (the accents of ancient Greek indicate pitch, not stress). The contours of the melody follow those pitches here, and fairly consistently in all the documents. But one shouldn't assume that the Greeks' idea of tuning was identical to ours. Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD provides precise mathematical ratios for numerous different scale-tunings, including one that he says sounds "foreign and homespun". Dr David Creese of the University of Newcastle has constructed an eight-string "canon" (a zither-like instrument) with movable bridges. When he plays two versions of the Seikilos tune using Ptolemy's tunings, the second immediately strikes us as exotic, more like Middle Eastern than Western music. The earliest musical document that survives preserves a few bars of sung music from a play, Orestes by the fifth-century BC tragedian Euripides. It may even be music Euripides himself wrote. Music of this period used subtle intervals such as quarter-tones. We also find that the melody doesn't conform to the word pitches at all. Euripides was a notoriously avant-garde composer, and this indicates one of the ways in which his music was heard to be wildly modern: it violated the long-held norms of Greek folk singing by neglecting word-pitch. However, we can recognise that Euripides adopted another principle. The words "I lament" and "I beseech" are set to a falling, mournful-sounding cadence; and when the singer says "my heart leaps wildly", the melody leaps as well. This was ancient Greek soundtrack music. And it was received with great excitement in the Greek world. The historian Plutarch tells a moving story about the thousands of Athenian soldiers held prisoner in roasting Syracusan quarries after a disastrous campaign in 413 BC. Those few who were able to sing Euripides' latest songs were able to earn some food and drink. What about the greatest of ancient poet-singers, Homer himself? Homer tells us that bards of his period sang to a four-stringed lyre, called a "phorminx". Those strings will probably have been tuned to the four notes that survived at the core of the later Greek scale systems. Professor Martin West of Oxford has reconstructed the singing of Homer on that basis. The result is a fairly monotonous tune, which probably explains why the tradition of Homeric recitation without melody emerged from what was originally a sung composition. "What song the Sirens sang," is the first of the questions listed by the 17th Century English writer, Sir Thomas Browne, as "puzzling, though not beyond all conjecture". "The reconstruction of ancient Greek music is bringing us a step closer to answering the question." </body>

      <title>Warning children about online porn</title>
      <description>Can schools keep pupils safe and innocent?</description>

      <body>Concerns about children's exposure to graphic sexual images online have led to calls for primary pupils to hear about the dangers of pornography. So how should schools broach the subject and what is the right age to start? At Castledyke Primary in Barton, North Lincolnshire, head teacher Rosie Pugh has adopted a robust approach to building children's resilience to any explicit material they may see online and is in no doubt that it needs to start early. She fears there are children vulnerable to abuse among her pupils and describes some of the stories she has heard from families as "eye-popping". Her views echo fears voiced by Ofsted earlier this year in a report which found that a lack of quality age appropriate sex and relationships education in more than a third of schools risks leaving children vulnerable to inappropriate sexual behaviours and sexual exploitation. The BBC sat in on a session for seven- to nine-year-olds at Castledyke run by Lynnette Smith, who teaches sex education and trains teachers in the subject in North Lincolnshire and East Yorkshire. Her approach is cheerful, direct and accompanied by hand-drawn illustrations that look as if they might have been done by an off-duty artist from The Beano. Each picture presents a scenario to which the children are asked to give a thumbs up or thumbs down. Lynnette uses the same set of cards for presentations from four-year-olds in their first year of the infants, to 10 and 11-year-olds about to leave for secondary school. The children find it hilarious. There are gales of laughter, coupled with appalled cries of disgust, but the half-hour sessions, which involve the whole class of up to 30 children, their teacher and a learning assistant, tackle some serious issues. Classes like this may not be suitable for all primaries cautions Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT): "Innocence is precious. You don't want to start too young." "My bottom line is to ask, 'From what age are they vulnerable?'" says Ms Smith. "Our first card is a girl with no clothes on. She looks as if she is ready for the bath. Well I hope she is not going to school". Lynnette asks the children to list the body parts that they should not let people touch. "Your widger and your lucy," is the response. She encourages the class to use "scientific" names instead of colloquialisms. The class chorus words like genitals, penis and vagina. There is a point to this. Knowledge and understanding can help keep a child safe, says Lynnette. "Paedophiles will avoid an educated child." The cards tackle different forms of good and bad touching. A kiss with a smile, a boy giving another boy a flower. A thumbs up to all of this. Then, grabbing a woman's breasts, looking under toilet doors when someone is inside, pulling at a boy's underwear. Thumbs down to this, declare the class. The cards tackle subtleties like where it is OK to urinate, expose your genitals or underwear or indeed to "have a little rummage in your underwear" - not outside, in broad daylight, but somewhere private like the bathroom. What sort of photographs are OK? Smiling at the camera with all your clothes on gets a thumbs up. Showing your bottom to the camera, a thumbs down. "He could put it on the internet!" says a boy. "It's a private part of the body. Nobody should ever take pictures of the private parts of your body except perhaps if you get injured and have to go to hospital," explains Lynnette. The next card depicts an older boy apparently showing a younger child an unsuitable image he has downloaded on to a smartphone. "Wrong, wrong, wrong", yells one boy. "No-one should make you watch something like that. You must tell someone," says Lynnette. Each child is asked to think of someone at home and someone at school they would tell. The picture after that is the view from behind a sofa where two adults are watching a porn film. "There are films where the actors have no clothes on or are hurting each other that some grown-ups want to look at but it's not meant for children," says Lynette. "If this is grown-ups watching and you are not there then that's fine but not if it's your babysitter or older children." There are hints that some members of the class are already aware of this sort of film: "My brother looks at pictures like this. He's 20," one child says. When Lynette asks if the child is forced to look at the pictures, he says no. Lynnette says the attitude of most children and young people is the same as it ever was. "Most are the same naive little kids who just want to know more about their bodies and are totally appalled and repelled by the idea of sex. "There are still a lot like that even at 14. "But because I have been in sex education since the mid-90s, I have seen how it's progressing. In 2002 everyone got the internet and much younger children began to see pornography. "Ten- and 11-year-olds are often keen to tell you what they have seen." Sometimes, she says, this kind of exposure can lead to sexually inappropriate behaviour and make children vulnerable to sexual exploitation. At the very least, children are asking questions about sexual issues at a much earlier age, particularly if they have seen something online or in the media that they do not understand. Sex and relationship education, she argues, is in urgent need of updating as the current guidelines do not mention issues such as sexting (the sending of sexually explicit material via a mobile phone) or pornography. In her presentation to parents before the sessions with children, she explains how vital it is to talk to children about these issues in the early years of primary school. Ideally the parents should feel confident to answer their child's questions. "If you're not sure of an answer, research it, maybe together in a book," she advises. "Don't ever say, 'Ask me when you're older,' because that's like saying, 'Go and Google it.' "If they know that they can talk to you now they will keeping coming back to you for information into their teenage years. "Most parents get it about right until children are about five and then they get the jitters." Some of the mothers said they had been horrified when they first read the school's letter about Lynette's visit but were reassured by her explanations. "I thought, no they're only seven. My husband said thank heavens he was away," said one. "It was never like this when I was at school. You find sex on television even at seven in the evening. I don't know how to address it really but you have to talk about it," said another. Ofsted's report said some schools left children vulnerable to abuse because they did not teach them appropriate language or develop the confidence to describe unwanted behaviours. It also said sex education in some primary pupils left pupils "ill-prepared" for puberty. The NAHT has called for "conversations" about online dangers to start early in primary school but Mr Hobby says these should be "general warnings that they may see things they don't like online and advice on what to do about it when they do". With schools needing to walk a line between protecting children from harm and maintaining their innocence, Mr Hobby says: "It needs a decision for each primary school in full consultation with parents." For Castledyke's head teacher, encouraging parents and teachers to talk about the issue with children is key to helping protect youngsters in vulnerable families from becoming victims of abuse. "I am always really surprised about how coy some adults are, but once it's in the open it's quite simple. You just need to speak to children openly, honestly and confidently", says Ms Pugh. "We've got to stop it happening to another generation." </body>

Not only does it lack the basic structures needed to operate, it is said to be close to "collapsing". Al-Madinah is the second free school to be put into special measures, after Discovery Free School in May 2013. A further five out of the 24 inspected so far have been labelled "requiring improvement" - the next worse category. But then it is only two years into the programme. Across England the latest Ofsted figures show that 2% of state schools are in special measures - 383 out of 21,186 inspections. But no up-and-running free school has unravelled quite so publicly as this Derby-based Muslim faith school. It started with claims about female staff being required to wear hijabs, Islamic headscarves, but the focus has shifted to the "unacceptable" level of education the government and inspectors now say it is providing. The key thing that makes this Ofsted report stand out, is the fact that the findings come just a year after the school opened. Most schools that deteriorate tend to do so over a much longer period of time. And many of the problems it highlights seem to have implications for the particular nature of free schools and the extra freedoms they are allowed. The report's second line says: "This is a school which has been set up and run by representatives of the community with limited knowledge and experience." Education Secretary Michal Gove argued that taking schools out of the hands of bureaucrats would liberate innovators to push up standards through reform and experimentation. But the Ofsted findings in this case reflect exactly what detractors of such DIY school projects feared would happen. They asked how people who knew little about education could set up and run something so complex and important as a school. In addition, teaching, which the government sees as the most important engine raising attainment, was found to be "inadequate". "Many teachers are inexperienced and have not received the training and support they need," the Ofsted report said. This seems to highlight one of the most fundamental differences between free schools and regular state schools - there is no obligation to employ qualified teachers in England's free schools. The Department for Education argued that it gave free schools this freedom, which exists amongst independent schools, to enable them to employ industry experts. But this does not appear to have worked in the pupils' favour in the Al-Madinah case. The Ofsted report said: "Almost all teaching seen during the inspection, including in the Early Years Foundation Stage, was judged inadequate." It added that most teaching and lessons in the primary school were poorly planned and that teachers did not know how to use pupils' assessments to plan lessons and set work. Questions are now being asked about how the Department for Education could approve a school for opening one year, only for it to be found to lack the "basic systems" it needs to operate 12 months later. Were the checks necessary for ensuring the school would be fit for purpose undertaken in a sufficiently rigorous way? Judging from the pre-registration report undertaken by Ofsted in the July before it opened, no assessment was made by the inspectorate of the school's ability to educate pupils. But Ofsted did wave the red flag at this stage over child protection measures, saying that four regulations had not yet been met and that staff needed to undertake training on such issues. This was highlighted by shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt in an emergency question in the Commons. The DfE has insisted that it took all necessary steps to ensure the school was fit for purpose when it opened in September 2012. It said: "Ofsted recommended Al-Madinah should be registered as long as four requirements were met. "Ofsted often sets out a number of requirements it wants to see before new schools can open. In this case, [Al-Madinah Education Trust] provided the necessary evidence to show that these requirements were met." But the report also said the school had "not been adequately monitored or supported". Prime Minister David Cameron has taken to local radio to say that the school should close if it does not take immediate action to put things right. But he also said that this particular case should not be used as a "stick to beat the whole free school movement" as these were delivering a better standard of education than most state schools. He quoted figures hailed by the DfE earlier in the year which said three-quarters of the first free schools were rated good or outstanding - which a spokesman pointed out was a significantly higher proportion than all state schools. But a check of the latest Ofsted data reveals that a higher proportion of state schools (78%) are rated good or outstanding compared with 75% of free schools. But Mr Hunt said the education of children in Derby was being sacrificed for ideology. He added: "It's not just the Al-Madinah School which is dysfunctional, it's the education secretary's free school policy." </body>

      <description>Stagnating social mobility warning - are the young paying the price?</description>

      <body>Alan Milburn says he was asked by the coalition to "hold its feet to the fire" in examining its progress on social mobility and child poverty. But just how much will his words hurt? In this, the first of what is planned to be an annual "State of the Nation report", the commission led by the former Labour health secretary concludes that "Britain remains a deeply divided country", one where "being born poor often leads to a lifetime of poverty". The commission says austerity has made it even harder to break ingrained cycles of poverty, that "disadvantage and advantage cascade down the generations". It warns there is a danger that social mobility will go in to reverse after rising in the middle of the last century and "flatlining" towards the end of it. The post-war years saw a big expansion of the middle classes, as the professional jobs market grew and more people bought their own homes, but there has been little change in the last quarter of the century. Mr Milburn said over decades, the UK had become a wealthier society, but had "struggled to become a fairer one" and had more children living in poverty and lower levels of social mobility than "many other developed nations". A total of 2.3 million children (one in six) live in poverty, he said, and this made it essential that the pattern where "birth not worth" determined a person's chances in life was changed. Higher social mobility had become "the new holy grail of public policy". It is certainly something all parties now say they want to see. The report from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission has stinging words on some areas of government policy but they are sweetened with praise for others, including the fact that the coalition continues to "stick to its commitments" on ending child poverty and improving social mobility in "challenging times". Mr Milburn told journalists at a news conference the government "deserved credit" for that. But the target of ending child poverty by 2020 - begun under Labour and continued by the coalition government - would "in all likelihood" be missed, he said. His most stinging criticism seemed to be about the way the young were likely to pay the highest price for a lack of social mobility and poverty during the global financial crisis. He called for older generations to be asked to dig deeper. The number of young people who have been unemployed for two years or more is at a "20-year high", he said. And there was an "inter-generational unfairness" in terms of who was being asked to pick up the bill in the recession. He did not call for pension cuts, but Mr Milburn said politicians should be prepared to "break political taboos" to talk about whether wealthier pensioners should lose benefits currently available to all - particularly the winter fuel allowance and the free TV licence. Pensioners were usually more worried about their grandchildren than themselves, he said. The commission is also looking to employers to do more - to offer better training, pay higher wages and open up professions to a wider pool of people. Two-thirds of children living in poverty, the report says, are living in homes with a working parent. Schools and universities were also urged to do more. He said schools in some areas were letting down pupils from poorer homes and those from middle-income homes too. Schools should give more help to low-achievers from middle-income homes as well as the poorest, while the government should improve careers advice, give extra incentives for teachers to teach in the worst schools and pay colleges "by results they achieve for their students in the labour market - not the numbers they recruit". As for universities - which were the focus of an earlier report by the commission - he says the sector as a whole has drawn in more students from poorer homes but top institutions remain out of reach for too many. Each year, he said, there were 3,700 "missing" state school pupils who had achieved the grades needed to get in to universities in the Russell Group (which represents some of the UK's leading universities) but did not go to them. The commission called for the government to put social mobility at the heart of its policies and practices, so that it was a "golden thread" running through all it did. It concentrated on the overall UK picture, but pointed out that in Scotland and Wales, the issue "currently has a low profile". In an age of austerity, the report's authors suggest creating a fairer society will be a job for all - and far from pain-free. </body>

      <body>A school in Bath is reported to have banned pupils from handing out birthday party invitations at school unless the entire class is on the guest list. Father-of-three Ben Milne explores the social minefield of children's parties. It's one of the big questions for parents of small children. Do you invite the whole class to little Harry or Sophie's party, or do you face the fall-out? What the head teacher of Kingswood Prep School in Bath has proposed isn't that revolutionary. At my children's primary school, for instance, the policy is for the child to give their teacher the invitations, which will then be placed discreetly in the invitees' school bags or trays. Nobody feels snubbed, and everybody's happy. What could possibly go wrong with this plan? Oh yes. Children. There you are, waiting for the hordes to arrive, furniture all re-arranged, and party food out on the table. Then your little darling realises they've got a school bag full of invites they've forgotten to give to the teacher. This actually happened to my nephew on his 10th birthday. He was remarkably sanguine about this (the unexpected windfall of unlimited Wotsits seemed to soften the blow somewhat). And if you do invite the whole class, what then? Do you really want your living room used to re-enact Battle Royale with party bags? Or if you want to keep the repair bill down, do you throw large sums of money at the local multiplex or five-a-side pitch? So it's time to whittle down the list. There's the Katie Hopkins method (exclude any child who doesn't share a name with a minor royal) or else there's a process of intense negotiation down from the 200 closest friends your child announces they want to invite, down to the manageable four you had in mind. But is it so bad not being invited to parties? Like a lot of not-very-nice, but survivable things in childhood - not being picked for the team, being blamed for something you didn't do - a snub isn't nice, but it's a small but valuable lesson for the hardships life one day throws at you. As Nietzsche (or was it Kelly Clarkson?) said, "What doesn't kill us, makes us stronger." I don't think he had kids' parties in mind, though.
