      <body>Political leaders and unions have welcomed news that the Grangemouth petrochemical plant is to stay open after a deal was struck with workers. Operator Ineos had announced on Wednesday that the plant was to shut, with the loss of 800 jobs, after union members rejected a survival plan. But the decision was reversed after the union agreed to Ineos's conditions. Ineos founder and chairman Jim Ratcliffe said it was "a victory for common sense". He confirmed Ineos would now press ahead with plans to invest £300m in a new gas terminal at the site, following a "significant change in attitude" from the Unite union. He added: "We have had assurances from the union yesterday that the changes we have requested in order for us to invest in that facility have been agreed and we are delighted to announce that Grangemouth will restart today, both the refining and petrochemicals side." The announcement on Grangemouth's future was greeted by huge cheers from the workforce, who had gathered at the plant to be told the news. The move brings to an end a bitter dispute with the Unite union which began over the alleged mistreatment of a Unite official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but Ineos shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a survival plan, which was initially rejected by union members. Reacting to the announcement, Unite Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said: "Relief will ring right round the Grangemouth community, and across Scotland today. "Hundreds of jobs that would have been lost can now be saved and £300m will be invested into the plant." The main points of the Ineos announcement included: First Minister Alex Salmond described the development as a "tremendous fillip for the workforce and the whole Grangemouth community, following what could have been a potential disaster". He said it had been "a great team effort from all concerned", including the unions and workforce, the management and governments. "I am delighted that people have rallied round to protect these jobs, and now we can all agree that Grangemouth has an outstanding future," he added. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael also welcomed the announcement, saying that it was "the news that we all wanted". "The staff and their families have been through a very stressful and uncertain time," he added. The announcement came as BP said it had reached an agreement with Ineos which would ensure that oil and gas supplies from the Forties Pipeline System would be secured. The pipeline - which brings oil and gas ashore from more than 50 North Sea fields - as well as BP's processing plant at Kinneil depend on steam and power from Grangemouth. BP said "some key commercial terms" had been adjusted in an existing deal with Ineos, but did not elaborate. It added: "By doing this, we have ensured that over a third of the North Sea's total oil and gas supplies will be unaffected, and that our motorist and airline customers will enjoy supply security." Ineos' future plans at Grangemouth include investing £300m in a new gas terminal at the site. Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean said: "It is a huge investment and that investment was only rightly to be done if we had a long-term sustainable base. "What we have now done is given the chemicals business another 15 to 20 years on the back of new raw materials, new contracts and significant investment." Mr MacLean would not dismiss the prospect of redundancies, but said they would be "very limited". The company has also said that 2,000 contractors it laid off after shutting down the complex would be re-hired to support investment in its survival plan. According to Ineos, the Scottish government has indicated it would support its application for a £9m grant to help finance its gas terminal plans, while the UK government has given "pre-qualification approval" for a £125m loan guarantee facility. Falkirk Council, which had planned to set up a task force to respond to the threatened closure, said the Ineos announcement was "the best possible outcome for all concerned". Council leader Craig Martin added: "There has been a tremendous effort behind the scenes to secure the plant's future involving UK and Scottish governments and Falkirk Council, working together to ensure the plant's survival. "This partnership approach has paid off and a more stable and positive future for the workforce has been delivered." </body>

      <title>UK growth fastest for three years</title>
      <description>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show, the fastest growth since 2010.</description>

      <body>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show. The Office for National Statistics said there had been a "fairly strong" performance across all sectors. The data builds on a 0.7% GDP rise in the April-June period and is the best quarterly performance since 2010. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne tweeted: "This shows that Britain's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity." Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the figures "show that we are firmly on the road to economic recovery". The ONS data for construction was up 2.5% over the quarter, the second successive quarter of growth after a volatile performance over the past year. The BBC's chief economics correspondent, Hugh Pym, said: "This could signal that a recovery in that sector is really under way." House-builders have been buoyed by the Government's Help to Buy scheme, which recently launched a new phase offering mortgage guarantees. The ONS said that production grew by 0.5%, though this remains 12.8% off its 2008 level, while within this, manufacturing improved 0.9% in the third quarter. The services sector, which represents three-quarters of economic output, grew by 0.7%. Output from services is now 0.4% above its pre-crisis peak in the first quarter of 2008. Friday's figure is the first estimate, and could be revised up or down in subsequent months. Mr Osborne told the BBC: "It shows that we are on the path to prosperity. Lots of risks remain, so we have to stick with the economic plan that has got us this far. "What's encouraging about these figures is that it's not just services that are growing. Construction is growing and manufacturing is growing." Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: "After three damaging years of flatlining, it's both welcome and long overdue that our economy is growing again. "But for millions of people across the country still seeing prices rising faster than their wages, this is no recovery at all." Despite the further evidence that recovery is gaining hold, some economists remain cautious. The Institute of Directors' chief economist Graeme Leach said: "The outlook looks better than at any time since the onset of the financial crisis. Indeed, our members have more confidence in the economy than at any time since 2008. "However, strong headwinds remain and the annual growth rate year on year is nothing to get too excited about yet. Though inflationary pressures are likely to remain benign, debt and inflation are rising faster than earnings. "By far the biggest challenges remain on the supply side, not the demand side. Supply side constraints mean that the current growth spurt is unlikely to extend beyond next year. "This stage of our economic recovery is likely to be short and sweet, instead of long and strong." The director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, John Longworth, said: "This is the highest quarterly increase we've seen in three years, so the economy is clearly moving in the right direction. "But we are still behind a number of advanced economies, such as the US and Germany, that have managed to recover the output lost during the economic downturn. "Much more needs to be done to transform our economy from being good to being really great." Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said the figures confirmed the UK was enjoying "a period of healthy and well-balanced growth". He said it was likely that the UK recorded the fastest quarterly growth rate within the G7 countries in the third quarter. But he added that a squeeze on real incomes as wage growth lagged behind inflation, together with the fiscal squeeze and a stagnant eurozone, were likely to prevent recovery gathering much more pace. It echoed remarks by Bank of England governor Mark Carney on Thursday evening, when he said in a speech that the rate of growth was "towards the top end of the advanced economies", but "coming from a very very low base". </body>

      <title>Jack Straw to quit at next election</title>
      <description>Jack Straw is to stand down as Labour MP for Blackburn at the next general election, he announces.</description>

      <body>Jack Straw is to stand down as MP for Blackburn at the next general election. The former Labour home and foreign secretary 67, was elected in Blackburn in 1979 and has stood in eight general elections in the constituency. He said his "love affair" with the town was "not going to end on 7 May 2015, nor is my connection with it." Labour leader Ed Miliband paid tribute to Mr Straw's "eloquence and wisdom" and said he "will continue to serve our country in many different ways". Mr Straw said: "Whatever national position I have held, the citizens of this town, and their children, have always been my first priority. "I am deeply grateful to everyone in the town for the faith which has been placed in me." But he said he had made the decision to stand down after a great deal of thought and consultation with friends and family. He added he "couldn't go on forever" and it would be "a terrible wrench" to stand down. Mr Straw held the positions of home secretary, foreign secretary and leader of the House of Commons under Tony Blair. Gordon Brown made him justice secretary in June 2007, a position he held until Labour's defeat at the 2010 election. Mr Miliband said: "Jack Straw will be greatly missed from the House of Commons. "On behalf of the Labour Party, I want to thank him for his nearly 35 years service as an MP, his achievements in government and his eloquence and wisdom. "He is Labour through and through, and always displayed this in his words and deeds. "He will be sorely missed but I know he will continue to serve our country in many different ways." Mr Straw practised as a criminal barrister before entering the Commons and was an adviser to Labour minister Barbara Castle, his predecessor as Blackburn MP. </body>

      <title>Mosque bomber given life for murder</title>
      <description>Ukrainian student Pavlo Lapshyn is jailed for at least 40 years for murdering an 82-year-old man and carrying out a series of mosque bombings.</description>

      <body>A Ukrainian student has been jailed for at least 40 years for murdering an 82-year-old man and plotting explosions near mosques in racist attacks. Pavlo Lapshyn stabbed Mohammed Saleem in Small Heath, Birmingham on 29 April, five days after arriving in the UK. On Monday, Lapshyn, 25, admitted murder as well as plotting to cause explosions near mosques in Walsall, Tipton and Wolverhampton in June and July. At the Old Bailey, he was told he would be jailed for life. Mr Saleem was stabbed to death, just yards from his home, after attending prayers at his local mosque in Green Lane. Lapshyn, from Dnipropetrovsk in Ukraine, was living in Birmingham while on a temporary work placement in the city when he killed Mr Saleem, a grandfather of 22. He later planted three bombs near mosques in the West Midlands as part of a campaign he said was motivated by racial hatred. He was arrested almost a week after an explosion in Tipton. The third device, which exploded near the Kanzul Iman mosque in Tipton on 12 July, was packed with nails. Police said it was only because Lapshyn got the wrong time for Friday prayers that the blast did not cause mass injuries. Sentencing, Mr Justice Sweeney told him: "You clearly hold extremist right-wing, white supremacist views and you were motivated to commit the offences by religious and racial hatred in the hope that you would ignite racial conflict and cause Muslims to leave the area where you were living. "Such views, hatred and motivations have no place whatsoever in our multi-faith and multi-cultural society." He added Lapshyn held "views abhorrent to all right-thinking people which have no place in our multi-cultural society". During interviews, Lapshyn told police he had murdered the grandfather of 22 because he hated "non-whites". Prosecutor Peter Wright QC told the Old Bailey that PhD student Lapshyn had come to the UK on a work placement with software company Delcam. The firm's sponsorship programme in partnership with the National Metallurgy Academy in Ukraine is now under review following his crimes. Lapshyn's apartment, above Delcam's offices in Birmingham, were raided by police who found chemicals and bomb-making equipment for another three devices. They also discovered a camera containing 455 photographs and 98 videos. Some of them showed Lapshyn detonating homemade bombs in the Ukrainian countryside. The camera also included shots of him making bombs. The force's anti-terrorism unit also discovered apparent anonymous notes in the apartment which he planned to use to taunt police. One featured a photograph of the hunting knife, next to which Lapshyn had written "Mohammed Saleem was killed by". He also referred to a police reward for information, saying "£10,000 small price, maybe £1m", followed by a smiley face, and the phrase "white power". The court heard Lapshyn had a video game on his laptop called Ethnic Cleansing and also posed for white a supremacist website with the knife. Defending, Richard Atkins QC said "we accept that his crimes are grave" and "the appropriate penalty we submit is life with a substantial minimum term". Mr Atkins told the court that Lapshyn is being kept in segregation and that the only person he speaks to regularly is his father. In an interview with the BBC, Lapshyn's father, Sergey Lapshyn, said he did not believe his son was a racist. "Among his acquaintances were people of different ethnic backgrounds, and I have never seen that (racism)," he said. He added his son could be "a bit tight-lipped" but was not calculating, as police had described him. Speaking from his home in Dnepropetrovsk, Lapshyn's father confirmed his own mother was a Muslim during her childhood. Lapshyn's father said his son knew his grandmother was a member of the (largely Muslim) Tatar community at the time of the former Soviet Union. "We never discussed religious problems and we always considered them to be very intimate," he said. Mr Saleem's family said their father had not done anything to deserve to die, other than be a Muslim. In a statement read out in court, Mr Saleem's daughter Shazia Khan said: "The shock and sadness of the reality is impossible to accept, yet alone accept and move on. "We can't move forward, the murder has disabled our minds in every emotional way possible." Speaking after the sentencing, Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale from West Midlands Police said Lapshyn was "very definitely driven by an extreme right-wing ideology and white supremacist ideology". Asked to describe Lapshyn's manner in police interview, he said: "He was matter-of-fact, he was cold, he was callous. "I do not think he has shown any remorse or regret for the crimes that have taken place." </body>

      <title>Teachers suspend planned strike</title>
      <description>A planned strike by teachers in England before Christmas is suspended after ministers agree to meet unions.</description>

      <body>Teachers in England are to suspend a planned national strike after ministers agreed to discuss the dispute. Two of the biggest teaching unions, the National Union of Teachers and the NASUWT, had planned to stage a one-day walkout before Christmas in a row over pay, pensions and conditions. But they say a strike will be held by 13 February next year if the talks do not lead to progress. It comes after a series of regional strikes by teachers this year. In a statement, the unions announced Education Secretary Michael Gove had said he was "willing to discuss a basis for genuine talks". Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said: "The public demonstration of the anger and frustration of teachers and the commitment of members to the action have secured the prospect of talks with the secretary of state. "We look forward to securing progress in these talks as quickly as possible." Christine Blower, general secretary of the NUT, said: "The successful regional strikes already undertaken show the strength of teachers' anger and concerns about the changes being made to their profession. "We are giving government the opportunity to engage in meaningful discussions with us to resolve our ongoing dispute. "We have always been available for such negotiations and would have preferred that this was a route the government had gone down sooner rather than later." Teachers are objecting to proposals by Mr Gove to bring in performance-related pay, make changes to their pensions and other changes which they say will increase their workloads. The first walkout was at the end of June in the north-west of England. Unions said 2,765 schools close or partially shut, across 22 authorities were affected. A strike on 1 October saw 2,500 schools affected across 49 authorities in the east of England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber. The most recent walkout on 17 October involved 3,5000 schools in London, Cumbria, the South East, North East and South West. </body>

      <title>DNA test proves mystery girl parents</title>
      <description>DNA tests confirm a Bulgarian Roma couple as the parents of mystery child Maria, whose discovery in Greece last week made global news headlines.</description>

      <body>DNA tests have confirmed a Bulgarian Roma couple as the biological parents of mystery child Maria, found in Greece last week, Bulgarian officials say. They identified the couple as Sasha Ruseva and Atanas Rusev. The officials are investigating whether the mother had sold the child - a claim she has denied. Maria was found at a Roma camp in central Greece. Police noticed the lack of resemblance between the blonde girl and the adults she was staying with. The couple, Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulou, have since been charged with child abduction. They have insisted the girl was given to them legitimately. Maria - who was found near Farsala, central Greece - is currently being cared for by the Athens-based charity The Smile of the Child. There have been thousands of inquiries following an appeal to identify her. The case has also sparked concern over prejudice and racism towards Roma people. The child's parents - Sasha Ruseva and Atanas Rusev - and their eight children, had been filmed earlier by Bulgarian television at their home in the Roma district of the central town of Nikolaevo. Ms Ruseva, holding a child with red hair, told reporters that she and her husband had been working in the Greek city of Larisa four years ago when she gave birth to a girl. The girl was seven months old when they had to return to Bulgaria, and she said she could not afford to take the child with her. She said she was talking to a woman she worked with who told her: "Give me this child, I will take care of it. You can come and take it back any time you want. "But I had other children to take care of and I couldn't go... I have never got any money for it." Bulgarian officials said that during questioning, Ms Ruseva said she had recognised Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulou as the people she had left her child with. Prosecutors have pressed preliminary charges against Ms Ruseva for "deliberately selling a child while residing out of the country". In Greece, a lawyer representing the couple in the Roma camp near Farsala said on Friday they planned to seek legal custody of Maria. "Provided what we said is borne out, that it was not an abduction, then logically they will be released from prison and they will be able to enter a proper [adoption] process," Costas Katsavos was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency. "They truly and ardently want her back," he added. Maria's biological parents in Bulgaria also say they want to be re-united with her. However, the head of Bulgaria's social services department, Lidia Hristova, told Reuters: "After an investigation, we will decide what would be best for the child, whether to take her from the family, to offer social service, or so on." There will now be difficult questions for police both in Greece and Bulgaria, the BBC's Mark Lowen in Athens reports. He adds that clearly there will still be a legal case against the Greek couple, and possibly against Maria's parents as well. But Greek police could be left red-faced for making the initial allegations of abduction, our correspondent adds. Greek news site zougla.gr has published what it says is Ms Ruseva's identity card and a birth certificate for Maria from a hospital in Lamia, not far from Farsala and Larisa. The birth certificate says the girl was born in January 2009. Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulou have told police Maria was four years old, but the Smile of the Child charity say medical examinations suggest she is more like five or six. </body>

      <body>A small tsunami triggered by a quake has hit Japan's eastern coast - where the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant is located - but no damage is reported. The 30cm (1ft) waves reached the region after the 7.1 magnitude tremor struck at a depth of 10km (six miles), about 320km off the coast. A tsunami alert issued for several areas was later lifted. Workers at the Fukushima power station had been told to leave waterfront areas for higher ground. But a Fukushima spokesman later said there was no damage or change in readings at radiation monitoring posts around the plant, according to Reuters news agency. The Japan Meteorological Agency had warned that a small tsunami - up to one metre (3.3ft) - could reach the eastern coast after the tremor in the Pacific Ocean. The agency had also issued a "yellow" advisory for Fukushima and the prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi, Ibaraki and parts of Chiba. But it added: "Though there may be slight sea-level change in coastal regions, no tsunami damage is expected." The earthquake struck at about 02:10 local time on Saturday (17:10 GMT Friday). The tsunami advisory was lifted about two hours later. The Fukushima reactors were damaged by the earthquake and tsunami of March 2011. Since then, most of Japan's nuclear reactors have remained off, amid impassioned debate over nuclear energy. More than 18,000 people were left dead or missing in that disaster. </body>

      <description>Warnings of stormy weather in parts of England and Wales on Sunday night and Monday are extended to more areas.</description>

      <body>Warnings of stormy weather in England and Wales on Sunday night and Monday have been extended to more areas. A Met Office amber alert of high winds in southern Wales and southern England now includes much of the Midlands, the East, and London and the South East. People are being warned of the risk of falling trees and damage to buildings, with gusts of up to 80 mph (120 kph), possibly higher around exposed coasts There is also concern heavy rain could cause surface water flooding. A yellow alert predicting heavy rain on Monday covers the whole of England and Wales. It is the lowest level of the three warnings issued by the Met Office, and advises people to "be aware". An amber alert, advising people to "be prepared" for potentially hazardous conditions, is one level up from this. BBC Weather presenter Peter Gibbs said a strong Atlantic jet stream is providing the "driving force" for the storm, which is expected to hit central England and Wales UK late on Sunday night and run across the country in a north-eastwardly direction. The strongest winds are expected on the storms southern and western flanks. Forecasters say a "very intense low pressure system" brings the potential for strong winds, especially on exposed coasts in Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Hampshire, West Sussex, East Sussex and Kent. Temperatures of up to 15C on Monday will be above average. The Met Office said "the public should be prepared for the risk of falling trees as well as damage to buildings and other structures, bringing disruption to transport and power supplies". But there is still some uncertainty as to exactly when the storm will reach the country. Eddy Carroll, chief forecaster at the Met Office, said: "This storm doesn't exist at the moment, but our forecast models predict it is likely to develop in the west Atlantic on Saturday. "Then it's likely to rapidly intensify just west of the UK late on Sunday before tracking across England and Wales early on Monday. "There is still a chance this storm may take a more southerly track and miss the UK, bringing impacts elsewhere in northern Europe, but people should be aware there is a risk of severe weather and significant disruption." The AA said stormy conditions could cause "significant travel disruption on Monday morning... one of the busiest times on the roads". Darron Burness, head of the AA's flood rescue team, said: "Strong wind and torrential rain is an unpredictable and hazardous combination, which can be quite overwhelming when you're driving. "There's likely to be tree and other debris on the roads as well potential flooding, so it's very important to keep your speed down and drive with great care." There is more information about the forecasts for Sunday and Monday on the BBC Weather and Met Office websites.

      <title>Cameron shares 'spying concerns'</title>
      <description>David Cameron says he shares the concerns of other EU leaders about alleged US spying but defends the UK's transatlantic intelligence relationship.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has said he shares the concerns of other EU leaders about claims that US intelligence agencies monitored the phone calls of Angela Merkel and other European politicians. The prime minister said a statement released by all 28 leaders saying that trust must be rebuilt between Europe and the US was "good and sensible". Reports he was forced to sign up to the text are wrong, the BBC understands. The PM also stressed the UK had a "unique" security alliance with the US. Allegations that US agencies engaged in widespread tapping of phone calls by prominent European politicians dominated the two-day European Council summit in Brussels. Germany has said it is unacceptable that an ally eavesdropped on conversations made by its chancellor and has made clear that co-operation between the two countries in this area must change in the future. French president Francois Hollande has said trust needed to be "restored and reinforced" following the revelations by whistle-blower Edward Snowden about the activities of the National Security Agency (NSA). Both leaders want talks with US officials later this year to agree an "understanding on mutual relations". Speaking at a press conference at the end of the summit, Mr Cameron said the EU wanted a "good partnership" with the US in all matters, including intelligence. "I think what Angela and Francois want to do is entirely sensible and other European countries are free to join in with that," he said. "I was very struck by my colleagues how they don't want some breach between the EU and the US." Defending the work of the UK security services, he said every country had to be satisfied that their operations were subject to proper oversight and the UK had "strengthened" its controls. "I am satisfied our intelligence agencies are properly governed. The work they do is very important. Every year they helped obstruct, put off, major terrorist attacks, in our country and other European countries too." He added: "Britain has a unique partnership with the USA (on security). For us we are in the right situation, but I understand what others want to do and support that, as I think does President Obama." The Daily Telegraph has claimed that Mr Cameron was effectively forced to sign up to the joint statement on spying. But the BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said the prime minister had offered his support, unprompted, during the news conference and the text of the statement only emerged during conversations over dinner on Thursday. However, it is understood conversations on the subject were uncomfortable for Mr Cameron. Asked about separate claims that the UK had eavesdropped on the conversations of Italian politicians, Mr Cameron said he could not comment on specific national security matters. But he insisted that the UK's security services operated within the legal framework and pointed out that Britain shared its intelligence extensively with EU partners. The prime minister also insisted the Snowden revelations would make the world more dangerous as they signalled "to people who mean to do us harm how to evade and avoid intelligence and surveillance and other techniques". </body>

      <title>Funds 'mismanaged' at free school</title>
      <description>Flagship free school Kings Science Academy in Bradford is accused of financial mismanagement in a government report.</description>

      <body>One of the country's flagship free schools has been accused of serious financial mismanagement. An Education Funding Agency (EFA) report reveals allegations of financial irregularities and even possible fraud at Kings Science Academy in Bradford. As a free school it is state funded but not under local authority control. In a statement to Newsnight the school admitted there were problems in the few months after the school was set up, but said those problems had been addressed. Kings Science Academy, which is a co-educational school for 11 to 18-year-olds, opened in September 2011 and was one of England's first free schools. Newsnight spoke to a former staff member and also the school's ex-finance director both of whom voiced concerns about the running of the school. It was set up by Bradford-born teacher Sajid Raza, also known as Sajid Hussain, who is now the school's headteacher. Mr Raza said he wanted to provide a first class education to some of the city's most deprived children. The school has been praised by Prime Minister David Cameron and Education Secretary Michael Gove, both of whom have visited it. Alan Lewis, a successful businessman and the Conservative Party's vice-chairman, was a key benefactor and supporter. And the school is built on land owned by Mr Lewis and leased to the academy by his company at a cost of £296,000 a year for 20 years. A draft EFA report was leaked to the BBC's Newsnight programme, which is broadcasting an investigation into the school later on Friday, but the Department for Education (DfE) has now published a redacted final version of it on its website. In a statement attached to the redacted report the DfE said: "We found serious failings in financial management at the Kings Science Academy (KSA). We informed the police who decided no further action was necessary. "We required KSA to address these failings urgently. A plan is in place to recover funds and the school is undertaking its own investigation. Any necessary disciplinary action is a matter for the school." The DfE said that concerns about governance arrangements at the school had been flagged up to them by a whistle-blower in late 2012, and that they had examined the allegations on an already scheduled visit, arranged to look at the school's financial management. The findings of that visit combined with the school's own review of its accounting triggered a forensic investigation in early 2013, the DfE added. The school was paid a £182,933 grant when it opened in September 2011. The EFA investigation found that £59,560 of payments were not supported by any evidence of payments being made, and £10,800 of this was supported by fabricated invoices for rent. There was also a total of £26,775 which had been over-claimed against payments which had been made legitimately. And that therefore, there was a total of £86,335 which had not been used for its intended purpose. The DfE said that when the academy was spoken to about the discrepancies they were able to provide some evidence of legitimate payments which resulted in the total amount which could not be justified being reduced to £76,933. The DfE says there is a plan in place for the school to pay back that amount. The report also flagged up the fact that a number of Mr Raza's family members were hired to work at the school. His brother was on the board of governors, his sister was a senior teacher at the school, his wife also worked there and his father drove the school bus. Speaking on condition of anonymity a former staff member spoke to Newsnight about their time at the academy. "I think with the benefit of hindsight now looking back on it it's fair to say certainly the key decisions or the key power and authority was based around his family," they said. The EFA report does not say whether Mr Raza's family members were appointed through the usual processes or not. However, it did flag up that some staff were appointed without interviews. "We were informed that a small number of staff were employed by the academy without applying for posts, although they were interviewed by the governing board members to ensure their suitability," the report said. The school's former finance director Daud Khan also spoke to Newsnight. "Sajid would do a lot of things behind closed doors. He wouldn't get me involved or anybody else. And I don't know how much he was telling the governors and even if he was telling them the majority of them were all their friends anyway, so they would back him up," Mr Khan said. A statement issued on behalf of Mr Raza and the school said that the issues raised by Newsnight related to a period two years ago. "We acknowledge that there were poor governance issues during the start-up due to the pace of setting the new school up in two to three months," it said "These have since been addressed with the support of external auditors and accountants Deloittes and Crowe Clark Whitehill. All payments received from the DfE have been fully accounted for by the academy and any sums incorrectly claimed have been repaid." It added that the latest reviews by the local authority had been positive. A statement issued by Mr's Lewis' company said: "His contribution to the academy has been that of a benefactor. At no time has Mr Lewis had responsibility for the financial management of the academy." </body>

      <title>Man denies owning 3D printer gun</title>
      <description>A man suspected of possessing a 3D printer with component parts to make a gun says the seized equipment had "nothing to do with a gun whatsoever".</description>

      <body>A man suspected of possessing a 3D printer with component parts to make a gun said the seized equipment had "nothing to do with a gun whatsoever". It follows police raids in Greater Manchester on Thursday, in which officers seized computer equipment. The arrested man said the suspicious parts were simply parts for the 3D printer. Experts have also cast doubts on the claims, saying the parts were not sophisticated enough to make a gun. 3D printing technology works by building up layer upon layer of material - typically plastic - to create complex solid objects. Greater Manchester Police said the components had been sent to the National Ballistics Service for further examination. The results are expected in the next few days. The force said it "cannot categorically say" whether they had recovered the component parts that could make a "viable" gun. US based printer maker, MakerBot Industries, which makes the components, said the company had examined the photographs. Jennifer Howard, the firm's director of PR, said: "We've seen the photographs and they definitely look like parts for the printer. "The first one looks like a pin that goes with an extruder upgrade - there is an upgrade kit that is available to make your printer work better. "The second looks like a filament spool, certainly that is what people who 3D print recognise it as." Brian Derby, professor of material science at Manchester University, said the printer was a "hobbyist's machine". He said: "It would make something that would look like a gun but it would not work as a gun." "You would have to buy an expensive machine for about £50,000 but you could get a real gun. "What is made is not likely to work. It is dangerous and likely to harm the person using it." The arrested man, who does not want to identified, was held following a police raid in Wythenshawe. "I have no idea why they think it is part of a gun," he said. "It's designed by the company that makes the printer to go in the printer to make it better." Assistant Chief Constable Steve Heywood, who is a member of the national firearms group, said: "What I would say is that its actually incredibly difficult to create the whole weapon. "And even if you do create the weapon its still incredibly difficult to fire it because it tends to blow up in your face." He said officers were "absolutely legitimate to get a warrant from the magistrate go in and do the search that we did". A GMP spokesman earlier said if the tests showed the parts could make a functioning weapon it would be the "first ever seizure of this kind in the UK". Asst Ch Con Heywood said: "We need to be absolutely clear that at that this stage, we cannot categorically say we have recovered the component parts for a 3D gun. "What we have seized are items that need further forensic testing by national ballistics experts to establish whether they can be used in the construction of a genuine, viable firearm." "It is prudent we establish exactly what these parts can be used for and whether they pose any threat." The raid was part of GMP's Operation Challenger, which aims to "dismantle" organised criminal gangs. Desktop 3D printers can be bought on the high street for less than £1,000, but prices can be as high as £10,000. The world's first gun made with 3D printer technology was successfully fired in the US in May. At the time, Europe's law enforcement agency Europol said it feared criminals would follow suit as the technology became cheaper and more user friendly. </body>

      <body>Augusto Odone, who rejected medical opinion and created an oil to save the life of his son Lorenzo has died. The former World Bank economist died in Italy aged 80, said his family. Augusto Odone taught himself enough science to invent a treatment for his six-year-old son after he was diagnosed with a neurological disease and given two years to live. Lorenzo eventually died aged 30. The battle to help him was depicted in a 1992 Hollywood film, Lorenzo's Oil. Lorenzo Odone was diagnosed with adrenoleukodystrophy, or ALD, a neurological disease that progressively destroys the brains of young boys. The disease leads to the build-up of dangerous "long-chain" fatty acids, and within a year children are paralysed, blind and unable to speak. Doctors predicted that Lorenzo would die in childhood. But Augusto Odone and his wife Michaela refused to accept the prognosis for their son, and put all their energies into trying to find a treatment. Despite having no formal scientific training, Augusto Odone studied medicine and biochemistry, and concocted a mixture of acids from olive and rapeseed oils. The Odones eventually persuaded an elderly British chemist, Don Suddaby, to distil the formula, which became known as Lorenzo's Oil. After testing it on a family member, Augusto Odone gave the oil to Lorenzo, with dramatic results: his long-chain fatty acids started to drop to normal levels. Its success in delaying the onset of symptoms in Lorenzo was demonstrated by the fact he lived to the age of 30, far beyond what doctors had predicted. Scientific studies have shown that the oil has most effect on children who have the ALD gene but have not yet displayed any of the symptoms. The story of Augusto and Michaela Odone was depicted in Lorenzo's Oil, which starred Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon as the parents. After the death of his wife in 2000, Augusto Odone returned from the United States to his native Piedmont region of Italy, to be near his surviving children. </body>

      <body>A monkey that escaped from Belfast zoo has been recaptured, after zoo staff shot it with a tranquilliser gun. The animal fell from a tree after it was sedated by zoo staff at Gideon's Green in Newtownabbey, County Antrim. A hydraulic lift, supplied by the fire service, was used to help zoo keepers reach the monkey in the trees. It was one of six lion-tailed macaques that escaped from the zoo on Monday. Five have now been recaptured but one monkey is still missing. Up to 12 zoo staff arrived in Gideon's Green after the monkey was spotted up a tree on Friday afternoon. A large crowd gathered to watch their attempts to capture the animal. The missing macaques had been spotted several times in the north Belfast and Newtownabbey areas over recent days. On Thursday, one of the monkeys was captured by zoo keepers in the grounds of Belfast Castle. Another escaped macaque scaled a "peace line" fence outside a primary school in Newtownabbey. It was spotted, perched on the peace line, during the school run on Thursday morning. Children at Hazelwood Integrated primary school, on the Whitewell Road, enticed the monkey down from the fence by offering it bananas. However, the animal took the bananas and escaped before zoo staff arrived. </body>

      <body>Troubled Sunderland may have been anything but infallible this season, but one man appears to be keeping the faith. Pope Francis has been given a personalised Black Cats shirt ahead of this weekend's derby clash with arch-rivals Newcastle United. The shirt was presented to him by Father Marc Lyden-Smith, who is Sunderland Football Club's chaplain. He is in Rome with Bishop Seamus Cunningham and a group of pilgrims. Fr Lyden-Smith said: "We have 60 pilgrims from the North East in Rome at the moment visiting churches and shrines. As part of the pilgrimage we took part in the papal audience on Wednesday morning. "As chaplain of Sunderland Football Club, they asked if I could present him with a shirt that had his name on the back - Papa Francesco. "It was a bit of a miracle really. There were 120,000 people gathered in the square. We managed to get tickets up at the front and the pope was guided towards us. "Some people from the North East managed to shake his hand and then I asked if he would accept the shirt and he took it and waved it in the air to cheers." Asked if the pope would be supporting the team against fierce rivals Newcastle United at Sunderland's Stadium of Light on Sunday, he said: "He is very diplomatic and wouldn't say that. "He's a keen football fan - he was a season ticket holder before he was elected as pope." </body>

      <title>Serco chief executive stands down</title>
      <description>The boss of security firm Serco resigns after accusations of overcharging the government tens of millions of pounds for electronic tags for criminals.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24672344</url>

      <body>The chief executive at Serco, a security firm at the centre of an overcharging scandal, has resigned. Outgoing boss Chris Hyman said the best way for the company to move forward "is for me to step back". Serco is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) after claims it had overcharged the government by "tens of millions" of pounds for electronic tags for criminals. The government welcomed the news, describing it as a "positive move". In July, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said an audit had revealed a "significant anomaly in the billing practices" of both Serco and rival G4S. Mr Grayling said that since 2005, the companies had in some cases been charging for tagging offenders who were in prison, had left the country or were even dead. In September, the government handed information to the SFO for their assessment. On Friday, Serco announced plans to reorganise the company. The firm said it would split the government work into a separate business that could be more closely monitored. For the moment, Mr Hyman's position will be taken over by Ed Casey, who runs the US division, while the company looks for an external full-time replacement. A government statement said it would "take full account of all the changes Serco have made today". "Whilst it is early days in their programme of renewal, this is a positive move by Serco and a step forward." The statement added that its review of government contracts, announced in July by the Justice Secretary, was continuing and would "ensure government's contractual arrangements are robust and taxpayers' money is spent responsibly, in a vibrant, competitive market for public services". Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan called for ministers to provide assurances that no confidentiality deals or "other arrangements that avoided justice" were being done. Mr Khan also asked ministers to "publish immediately the PriceWaterhouseCooper report into the activities of G4S and Serco." Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz said he was "surprised" by the resignation of Mr Hyman, because he "always maintained there is nothing untoward with the contracts Serco holds with the government". He said Mr Hyman maintained the position "even after the company was referred by Secretary of State for Justice to the SFO". Shares in Serco, which has in excess of 120,000 staff in more than 30 countries, rose after the news. It has lost more than 10% of its value since May - when the government first voiced its concerns over the tagging contract. "They were always going to have to make some sort of major change," Cantor analyst Sam Thomas said. "This is about transforming their recently damaged reputation and I think in appointing an external new chief executive they are hoping to draw a line under the previous issues." Mr Hyman said he had "always put the interests of Serco first", adding that it was important the relationship with the government was rebuilt. He said: "I have been fortunate enough to have had the privilege of working at a great company with extremely talented people. I wish everyone at Serco the very best for the future." No new contracts are being awarded to either of the firms until the audit is completed, the government said in September. The UK chief executive at G4S, Richard Morris, also stepped down on Thursday. The latest development in the scandal is likely to fuel debate over the value to the government of outsourcing public services to private companies, after G4S failed to provide enough security staff for the 2012 Olympics. </body>

      <body>A spat between two former Conservative leaders continues after Iain Duncan Smith mocked Sir John Major's support for a "cones hotline" in the 1990s. Relations between the two men have been cool ever since Mr Duncan Smith led opposition to Sir John over the Maastricht Treaty on EU integration. On Tuesday, Sir John took a swipe at Mr Duncan Smith's welfare reforms, saying his "genius was unproven". Now Mr Duncan Smith has hit back in an interview in the Evening Standard. Asked about Sir John's comments, Mr Duncan Smith told the newspaper. "Well, as I say, I never really get too fussed about what people think about their own intellects. "I'm always happy to be in awe of someone whose own intellect delivered us the cones hotline, I must say." The cones hotline - a telephone number for motorists to ring if they were irritated by unattended road works - was one of the most mocked policies of the Major government. A source close to Mr Duncan Smith insisted to the BBC it was a throw away line and meant as a joke. There has been little love lost between the two men since, as a backbencher in the early 1990s, Mr Duncan Smith was one of a group of rebels who fought a long parliamentary campaign against the Major government's decision to sign up to the Maastricht Treaty - regarded as a landmark moment in European integration. The battles, which resulted in the Major government facing a confidence vote in the House of Commons, undermined Sir John's authority and led to the prime minister calling his opponents "bastards". He repeated the phrase in a speech to an audience of political journalists on Tuesday, saying his use of the word was "unacceptable" but "his only excuse was that it was true". In the speech, Sir John also questioned the likely outcome of Mr Duncan Smith's sweeping programme of welfare changes. "Iain Duncan Smith is trying to reform benefits," he said. "I truly wish him well. But it is enormously complicated and unless he is very lucky, which he may not be, or a genius, which the last time I looked was unproven, he may get some of it wrong." Mr Duncan Smith's Universal Credit is seen as one of the most ambitious, and potentially risky, policies the coalition has embarked upon. Chancellor George Osborne has denied reports in a recent book by the journalist Matthew D'Ancona that he had questioned whether Mr Duncan Smith had the intelligence to run a major department like work and pensions. Referring to the matter recently at the Tory conference, Mr Duncan Smith pointed out that both Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher had had their intellect questioned but had proved their doubters wrong. And Mr Duncan Smith told the Evening Standard on Friday: "I never make any claims for myself, I just say I think we should all look at each other and be a little more pleasant." </body>

      <description>Campaigners write to David Cameron demanding action on the "national crisis" of cold homes, as people are advised to keep houses well heated.</description>

      <body>Fuel poverty campaigners have written to Prime Minister David Cameron demanding cross-party action on the "national crisis" of cold homes. Campaigners said the UK was second only to Estonia for people struggling to pay their energy bills across Europe. It came as Public Health England urged people to keep their homes well heated this winter to avoid potentially fatal health problems. It said living rooms should be 21C (70F) and other home areas 18C (65F). Campaign group Energy Bill Revolution - an alliance of charities including Age UK and Barnardos - said the biggest problem in the UK was "leaky homes" and called for investment in a domestic insulation programme. Energy Bill Revolution said "woeful" levels of insulation had left Britain falling way behind comparable European countries such as Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands. Campaign director Ed Matthew said: "Our political leaders are falling over themselves to come up with headline-grabbing ways to cut energy bills yet they fall woefully short of a true solution to the energy bill crisis. "By far the biggest opportunity to cut energy bills is to fully insulate the UK's leaky homes. No other investment can do so much for so many. If the government is serious about solving this crisis they must make insulating homes the UK's number one infrastructure priority." Public Health England's advice came in its Cold Weather Plan for 2013, after four of the big six energy companies announced price rises. Age UK said older people in particular were increasingly anxious about the cost of heating their homes. Winter health risks range from flu to falls - but the cold can also make heart and respiratory problems much worse. On average there are about 24,000 excess winter deaths in England each year, many of which experts say are preventable. The plan has been produced in collaboration with the Department of Health, NHS England and the Local Government Association. It contains advice for the NHS and local government, as well as individuals. This includes having your flu vaccination if you are in an at-risk group, ensuring homes are properly insulated and making sure heating systems are routinely checked. From November, the Met Office will issue cold weather alerts if the temperature dips to 2C (35F) or less, or if there is severe winter weather such as heavy snow or widespread ice. Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection and medical director at Public Health England, said: "In colder weather, keeping yourself warm is essential to staying healthy, especially for the very young, older people or those with a chronic condition such as heart disease and asthma." Public health minister Jane Ellison said: "The elderly and those with long-term illnesses are particularly at risk during winter months so it's crucial that people stay warm." Age UK's charity director Caroline Abrahams said: "Being cold is a huge health risk for older people so it is absolutely essential that older people stay warm during the winter months. "But with fuel poverty blighting the lives of millions of households in the UK many older people are feeling increasingly anxious about the rising cost of energy. "The government must show it has a clear long-term plan to make low income homes more energy efficient." Labour's shadow energy and climate change minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: "People are being left in real hardship because David Cameron won't stand up to the energy companies. "Britain's energy is market is not working for families and business." </body>

      <body>A shake-up of English literature at A-level will result in teenagers studying a minimum of eight texts in depth, says a consultation paper. History A-level students will study a "chronological range" of at least 200 years, while science A-levels will include more maths. The changes, put forward by exam boards with advice from academics, flesh out government plans for A-level reforms. A-levels will depend on final "linear" exams after two years study from 2015. The changes have proved controversial and include the "decoupling" of AS-levels from A-levels to become a stand-alone qualification. The consultation document outlines revisions to 14 A-level subjects: art and design, biology, business studies, chemistry, computing, economics, English language, English literature, English language and literature, geography, history, physics, psychology and sociology. It follows a review of the content of A-levels earlier this year chaired by Prof Mark E Smith, vice-chancellor of Lancaster University, with input from the exam boards. The consultation translates the review's recommendations into proposals for each subject. Maths and language A-levels are being considered separately and will not be taught until 2016. In English literature, the eight texts to be studied in depth must include at least three works from before 1900 including a Shakespeare play, as well a work from after 2000. Students currently have to study 12 texts - six at AS-level and a further six for the full A-level. The new exam will also include an "unseen text". "To prepare for examinations with unseen texts, students will need to read widely, broadening their knowledge and their critical and comparative understanding of literature", says the consultation paper. English language A-level students will have to study six texts, including "non-literary" work such as essays or journalism. The new history A-level will no longer require students to study more than one period. Instead sixth-formers will be asked to study topics from a chronological range of at least 200 years. "This will enable A-level students to develop an understanding of historical events in the context of longer term and broader chronological changes," says the document. Business studies and computing A-levels will be renamed business and computer science. Students taking economics, computer science, biology, chemistry, physics and psychology A-levels, will have to use more maths. In art and design, there will be "a new emphasis on drawing". Professor Smith said: "The government has made clear that higher education should have a greater role in reforming A-levels. "I fully support an approach where universities play a key role, as we see first hand what A-level students have learned and the skills they have acquired. "I believe the proposals set out here update, modernise and improve A-level content." A separate consultation on A-level coursework and on the new AS-levels for the same 14 subjects was also launched on Friday by the exams regulator, Ofqual. This looks at "subject by subject arrangements that put in place a better balance between exam and non-exam assessment or coursework". The changes include the reintroduction of non-exam assessment of fieldwork in geography which will count for 20% of the final grade. In biology, chemistry and physics, practical skills will be assessed but the marks will be reported separately and will not count towards students' grades. AS-levels will be designed so that they can be taught alongside A-levels. Ofqual says: "In other words the content of an AS will be a sub-set of the content for the corresponding A-level." </body>

      <body>The adult-themed crime game, Grand Theft Auto 5, has won the top prize at the Golden Joystick awards. Rockstar's controversial game - where players commit crime in the fictional city of Los Santos - was presented with the Game of the Year gong at a ceremony in central London. Sony's The Last of Us also scooped two awards. Ken Levine - the man behind Bioshock and System Shock 2 - was honoured with a lifetime achievement award. The Golden Joysticks are the largest publicly-voted video game awards in the world, with this year more than 10 million people casting a vote. The Lifetime Achievement is a new addition to the ceremony. Mr Levine has been a high profile figure in the industry ever since he worked with designer Doug Church, on the first-person shooter, Thief: The Dark Project, credited with being one of the first titles to introduce the concept of stealth into video games. "The great thing about the still-maturing nature of video games is you get to be inspired by the work of novices and veterans alike," he said. "We're all figuring out day by day exactly what the medium is capable of." Now in its 31st year, the awards were first given out back in 1983, with the first Game of the Year award going to Jet Pac on the ZX Spectrum. Andy Robinson, editor of Computer and Videogames, said that three decades on, the awards still "represent the voice of gamers worldwide". "We've revamped the categories to reflect the diversity of modern gaming and also added the inaugural Lifetime Achievement award, which has made this year's ceremony the most thrilling for us yet," he said. The Golden Joysticks are not the only big awards for the video games industry. The British Academy of Film and Television Arts hands out its Video Game Baftas in the spring each year, although the majority of their awards are selected by a panel of experts, rather than a public vote. Grand Theft Auto 5, released last month, quickly became the fastest selling entertainment product ever, taking just three days to generate $1bn (£620m) in revenue. </body>

      <title>Dino impact 'also decimated bees'</title>

      <body>Scientists say there was a widespread extinction of bees 66 million years ago, at the same time as the event that killed off the dinosaurs. The demise of the dinosaurs was almost certainly the result of an asteroid or comet hitting Earth. But the extinction event was selective, affecting some groups more than others. Writing in Plos One journal, the team used fossils and DNA analysis to show that one bee group suffered a serious decline at the time of this collision. The researchers chose to study bees within the subfamily known as Xylocopinae - which included the carpenter bees. This was because the evolutionary history of this group could be traced back to the Cretaceous Period, when the dinosaurs still walked the Earth. Previous studies had suggested a widespread extinction among flowering plants during the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event 66 million years ago. And it had long been assumed that the bees that depended upon these plants would have met the same fate. Yet, unlike the dinosaurs, "there is a relatively poor fossil record of bees," said the paper's lead author Sandra Rehan, a biologist at the University of New Hampshire in Dunham, US. This has made the confirmation of such an extinction difficult. However, the researchers were able to use an extinct group of Xylocopinae as a calibration point for timing the dispersal of these bees. They were also able to study flower fossils that had evolved traits that allowed them to be pollinated by bee relatives of the Xylocopinae. "The data told us something major was happening in four different groups of bees at the same time," said Dr Rehan. "And it happened to be the same time as the dinosaurs went extinct." The findings of this study could have implications for today's concern about the loss in diversity of bees, a pivotal species for agriculture and biodiversity. "Understanding extinctions and the effects of declines in the past can help us understand the pollinator decline and the global crisis in pollinators today," Dr Rehan explained. </body>

      <body>It is a year to the day since the news that ash dieback had been found in Britain's native woodland was officially confirmed. The announcement sparked a deal of hand wringing and some dire predictions - it would be Armageddon in the countryside, as the disease that had decimated European forests let rip in this green and pleasant land. It was even claimed that a third of Britain's trees might be lost in little more than a generation.

      <body>Actors David Tennant and Olivia Colman have helped ITV's Broadchurch win four prizes - dubbed the Daggers - at the Specsavers Crime Thriller Awards. The pair picked up the best actor and actress awards for their roles in the drama, with co-star Andrew Buchan named best supporting actor. Broadchurch also won the TV prize, with Bond movie Skyfall named best film. Martina Cole and Wilbur Smith were also inducted into the Crime Writers' Association Hall of Fame at the event. The pair were honoured in recognition of their contributions to the genre. The awards - which marked the culmination of ITV3's Crime Thriller Book Club - included a new award for the club's best read, which went to Malcolm MacKay for The Necessary Death Of Lewis Winter. After beating books by Linwood Barclay, Megan Abbott, Christopher Fowler, Diana Bretherick and Andrew Taylor, the author said it was "a huge honour and thrill to win". Mick Herron picked up the coveted Gold Dagger award for best crime novel of the year for Dead Lions. "My shelves are crammed with Gold Dagger-winning novels of the past - The Mermaids Singing, Black and Blue, Bones and Silence. I can't quite believe I get to put my own book next to them," he said. The best new crime writer prize went to Derek B Miller for his debut novel Norwegian By Night Roger, while Roger Hobbs's Ghostman was named best thriller of the year. Other awards went to Amelia Bullmore, who won best supporting actress for her role in ITV's Scott and Bailey, while Danish series The Killing III won the best international TV prize.

      <title>IVF and the marketing of hope</title>
      <description>Five million babies have been born thanks to IVF. But few people talk of the many more times the treatment doesn't work, says Lisa Jardine.</description>

      <body>Five million babies have been born thanks to IVF. But few people talk of the many more times the treatment doesn't work, says Lisa Jardine, the departing chair of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. Modern medicine can achieve extraordinary feats in repairing and protecting the human body, from hip replacements to life-extending cancer treatments. But for most of us, I think, there are two areas of medical intervention that have a very special status and deserve the closest ethical attention: birth and death, the creation of life and its termination. Just such close scrutiny was given to an amazing breakthrough in the treatment of infertility - the birth of the first "test tube baby", Louise Brown, in Oldham in 1978. As further successful IVF births followed, it was quickly decided by the British government that some sort of ethical and legal oversight was needed. Treating infertility by combining egg and sperm outside the womb, and then replacing the resulting embryo in the mother, was an established clinical reality. The question was, is it ethically acceptable to carry out the procedure, and what limitations and controls should be placed upon it to satisfy public concern? In summer 1984, the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Human Fertilisation and Embryology - the Warnock Report - was published. The task of the committee had been "to examine the social, ethical and legal implications of recent, and potential developments in the field of human assisted reproduction". The report highlighted the "special status" of the human embryo, and proposed the establishment of a regulator. The legislation derived from the report continues to govern In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) in the UK 30 years later under that regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, or HFEA. PDF download The Warnock Report[770KB] Dame Mary Warnock - now Baroness Warnock - turned out to be the ideal person to steer the public moral debate on IVF. As commentator Andrew Brown wrote in 2003: "Her distrust of grand schemes and theories [made] her much in demand as a kind of philosophical plumber to the establishment - whenever some tricky problem arose, she could be trusted to get things flowing again." Born into an old-fashioned, well-to-do family, Warnock studied Classics at Oxford, and became a lecturer in philosophy at St Hugh's College in 1949. Turning her attention to schooling after the birth of her five children, she became head of Oxford High School in 1966, and spent six years championing girls' secondary education. In the 1970s, she moved into public life and began to demonstrate her considerable skills as a committee chair capable of dealing with tricky political and ethical issues. She chaired a Home Office Commission of Inquiry into the use of animals in laboratory experiments, and a government commission on the education of children with special needs. Her clear-headedness and keen intellect helped dissect the issue and structure the agenda in whatever controversial arena she engaged in. These talents were complemented by her administrative skill, and her shrewd grasp of politics. She knew which recommendations would work administratively while being politically workable too. Even she probably did not anticipate the furore the Warnock Report would cause. There was opposition from religious figures, politicians and the general public to the very practice of this way of creating new life. It is a real tribute to the care with which the report was written that eventually legislation to regulate IVF went on to the statute book, and the regulatory body to oversee it - the HFEA - was set up. "Perhaps the greatest achievement of the Warnock committee is that it managed to get an ethical consensus that people understood as well as shared," observed a former HFEA chair. The results of Warnock's astuteness are to be seen in the formal structure of the HFEA as established in 1990. It must have expert medical and scientific representation, she advised, but it ought to be led by a lay chair - someone with strong ethical beliefs, but outside the IVF sector. Each of its decision-making committees should also have a lay majority. I have served as chair of the HFEA for the past six years. Next month will be my last authority meeting. So it seems an appropriate moment to reflect on my experience in that role. I have seen at first hand how the regulation of IVF uses the most elegant features of UK regulatory legislation to best advantage. Legislation is passed which lays down a broad-brush picture of a sensitive area's activities and how they need to be monitored. Then the specialist regulator monitors those activities on a day-to-day basis - in the case of IVF, recording the details of every one of the 60,000 cycles carried out in a calendar year, inspecting and licensing clinics in both the NHS and the private sector and approving research involving embryos. In a fast-changing field, decisions on difficult or anomalous cases are taken on an individual basis, with the best available expert advice, and policy is developed to cover new techniques and circumstances as they emerge. The most important consequence of the close scrutiny the HFEA gives is that public confidence is robustly maintained, even as the possibilities given to those unable to have children naturally, but desperate to do so, expand at a giddying speed. Baroness Warnock will have been barely aware in the 1980s of clinical possibilities which now enable parents who carry a rare genetic defect to have their embryos screened, and an undamaged one selected, so that the baby will not die in infancy. She could not have imagined the technique of mitochondrial replacement - removing the nucleus from an egg with mitochondrial abnormalities, and placing it in a donor egg. Over the past two years, the HFEA has carried out a consultation process with clinicians, scientists and the public in order to advise the present government on whether this technique - which has up to now only been allowed in the research laboratory - should be introduced into clinical practice. Perhaps surprisingly, the public supported the new technique, if it could prevent serious illness. They had little objection to its being approved for clinical use, as long as it was scrupulously overseen by an appropriate regulatory body. Like any outgoing chair, there are, of course things I regret not having achieved. My personal mission when I took up the post was, inevitably given my interests, public engagement - disseminating as widely as possible both the benefits and disadvantages of all aspects of assisted reproduction. This proved to be unexpectedly difficult to do. There is an extraordinarily high level of coverage of any story involving IVF in the media - celebrity births, tales of miracle babies after years of trying, and above all, breakthroughs in clinical practice which may bring hope to thousands wishing for their own child. This is a sector that trades in hope, and the papers and women's magazines are full of encouragement. Yet the success rates for IVF remain discouragingly low. The last figures we have show that for every cycle of IVF, fewer than a third of patients will emerge with a baby (the figures are somewhat higher for women under 35). That leaves two thirds of would-be mothers and fathers with the heartbreak of "failure". And the costs are high - 60% of IVF treatment in Britain is carried out in private clinics, but the HFEA has no control over the prices charged. A couple - and nowadays that means same-sex couples as well as traditional partnerships - is likely to have spent something of the order of £15,000 for the three cycles it is likely to have taken should they be fortunate enough to become pregnant. I would have loved to have been able to have spoken more often and more publicly, with more words of caution for those proposing to undertake IVF, or postponing their family because IVF seems a reliable option should natural conception fail. Columnist Zoe Williams wrote a telling piece about the heartache of unsuccessful treatment last month, headlined Where's all the grief going? But newspapers today want banner headlines and excitement. Public information is nowhere on their agenda. Try as I might, I have not been able to talk at length to all those families out there who are about to enter the world of IVF, or who are undergoing treatment and being persuaded to try again and again when it fails, or who are entering their 40s and hoping IVF will allow them to start a late family. The world of IVF is a market, a market in hope. Those who enter it deserve to be fully informed of its potential to deliver grief and a sense of failure, as well as success.

      <body>Welcome to The Loop, the Magazine's letters column, including the best of your thoughts from Twitter and Facebook. Readers will, we hope, excuse confusion on our part this week when we saw this tweet from Noel Lynch. He wrote: "A lion tamer friend of mine once told me that lion urine works very well." But what was he referring to? Something to do with how to deter foxes from your garden, perhaps? The Magazine spoke to a fox expert who specialises in removing them in ways that will not harm the animal. They call it "humane deterrence" and don't like to be labelled as pest controllers. The trick is to disturb the wily creatures' normal behaviour. The piece singularly failed to discuss how one might humanely collect lion urine, however. So we thought perhaps the tip was something about how to deal with problematic housemates, as the Magazine had also noted that the high cost of rent in the UK forces many people into multiple-person houseshares. Avoiding picking a duff housemate can be tricky, but there could be a few signs to look out for. @Philly_Spurr: "If they come to view a flat with their annoying partner and casually enquire about a double bed, its a no go!" Housemates' partners can be trouble makers, as John Morris pointed out: "I shared a house with two girls in Shooters Hill in the 1970s. One day I came home and one of the girl's boyfriends had adorned the living room and hall with posters for the Socialist Workers' Party. I left." Amy Wilson for Leamington Spa is having a much more positive experience, though. "I currently live in a house share with 20 other people. Our little community comprises international students, young professionals and the odd nutter. The biggest thing I have learnt is compromise. The kitchens may not always be clean and food goes missing, but the experience of living with so many different people and cultures makes up for it tenfold. I have learnt so much from the people I live with I can forgive the odd mouldy cup!" After pondering Noel's tweet at length, we thought it might be referring to the story about exotic pastries - a new generation of French pastry chefs are reinventing their craft with audacious creations. Anyone for a caramel popcorn, pistachio orange or pecan eclair, or an olive-oil macaroon with mandarin orange and cucumber water? Perhaps these new flavours are crying out for a secret ingredient. Ingredients - particularly bitter ones - are popular with drinks such as the Aperol spritz, the Negroni, and a host of cocktails flavoured with "bitters". The taste of Negronis was the subject of a conversation by readers on Facebook. Could someone please help Sanjeev Prakash out? "Alright, I 'fess: I like Campari as an aperitif, but what the blazes is a Negroni..? Gin +______?" Jane Shepherd, perhaps, who loves Negronis. "When I was 23 I came back from an Italian break with a bottle of Campari, a drink I'd enjoyed in Rome and Sorrento. Instead of sipping it sedately and making it last, I made a big bucket of Negroni (not so easy on the gin) with my flatmates and felt no pain whatsoever." One thing we know a Negroni is not made from is lion urine. C'mon Noel Lynch, help us out here. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>Garth Crooks has criticised Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho for their response to the Yaya Toure racism row. Arsenal manager Wenger wants to wait for "more proof" that Manchester City midfielder Toure was racially abused by CSKA Moscow fans on Wednesday. And Chelsea boss Mourinho has played down talk of black players boycotting the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Crooks, trustee of anti-racism campaign group Kick It Out, said he was "disappointed" by their comments. "How many more times are black players going to have to suffer this nonsense in order to play football," said BBC football expert Crooks, who played for Stoke and Tottenham. "For Wenger to ask for further evidence is extraordinary given the fact that Yaya heard the evidence reported and his club have backed their captain on the night. "I am equally disappointed with Jose Mourinho's comments, about how he feels that black players should go into a hostile racial environment in order to show them how good they are. "Now there is a man who has never had to suffer racial abuse. "I really expected modern managers such as Wenger and Mourinho to support Toure and other Premier League players." "If that is the best they can say on this issue, I suggest they stick to what they know." Toure claimed he was racially abused in Moscow and suggested African players might boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Asked on Friday if a boycott was still a possibility, the Ivory Coast player told BBC Afrique: "We're not here yet." He added: "Let's leave Fifa and Uefa to do their work." Mourinho insists boycotting the 2018 World Cup is not the way to combat racism in football and urged players not to punish "billions" for the "disgraceful behaviour" of thousands. "The history of football was made equally by many races," he said. "And the black players have a fantastic contribution of what football is. "You go to the World Cup, the World Cup is the biggest expression of national team competitions - races, people from different parts of the globe, people from every continent. And the black players are very, very important for that. "Who is more important, the billions of people in love with the game around the world? Or a few thousand that go to football stadiums and have disgraceful behaviour in relation to black players. "If I was a black player I would say the other billions are much more important, so let's fight the thousands, but let's give to the billions what the billions want. And the billions want the best football and the best football without black players is not the best football, for sure." Wenger added that Uefa must complete its investigation before there is any more talk of a boycott. "I don't know what really happened there, but you cannot tolerate racism of any kind and you have to fight against it. How do you do that?" he said. "Honestly I believe Uefa is taking action in the right way and to go as extreme as a boycott, it's a bit early to do that because it's not proven what happened. I believe that Russia itself has to fight against that and of course you want everybody to be active on that." Toure spoke to referee Ovidiu Hategan during the 2-1 win over CSKA to complain about the behaviour of the home fans, although the Russian club have denied any racist abuse took place. The Romanian official chose to do nothing at the time, but Uefa, which governs European football, has since opened disciplinary proceedings against CSKA Moscow for the "racist behaviour of their fans". </body>

      <body>South Africa have been penalised five runs for ball tampering during the third day of the second Test against Pakistan in Dubai. Replays showed Faf du Plessis rubbing the ball over a zip on his trousers. After talking to Proteas captain Graeme Smith during Pakistan's second innings, umpire Ian Gould awarded the additional runs to Pakistan. But South Africa vice-captain AB de Villiers said: "We are not a team that scratches the ball." The decision meant the umpires had decided the ball's condition had been changed contrary to the game's rules. It is expected the umpires will lay a charge against Du Plessis to match referee David Boon after the day's play, with an immediate hearing to follow. "We don't cheat, it is as simple as that," De Villiers continued. "I know Faf du Plessis very well, he's the last player on the field who will try something like that. "It is part of his responsibility to shine the ball and get it to swing. It's not an easy job and I thought he did it very well." Gould and fellow umpire Rod Tucker, who also ordered the ball to be changed, took the unusual action at the start of the evening session in Dubai, where South Africa are on the verge of completing a comfortable victory. After bowling Pakistan out for 99 in their first innings, Smith hit 234 and AB de Villiers 164 as South Africa made 517 in reply. Pakistan were 132-4 at the close on day three, needing a further 286 to avoid an innings defeat. "As per 42.1 of the ICC playing conditions, the umpires replaced the ball and fined the South Africa team five penalty runs for ball tampering," an ICC spokesperson confirmed. The last time a five-run penalty was issued for ball tampering was during the 2006 Oval Test between England and Pakistan, when the tourists were adjudged the guilty party. Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq reacted angrily and decided not to continue the Test in protest. Australian umpire Darrell Hair duly awarded the game to England - the only forfeited match in Test history. This month, the ICC amended its laws regarding the condition of balls, saying "if a player responsible can be identified" the ball will be changed, a five-run penalty will be awarded and the player responsible will be reported. Altering the condition of the ball is a level two offence under the ICC's code of conduct, which carries a penalty of 50-100% of their match fee and/or suspension from one Test or two one-day internationals for a first offence. </body>

      <body>Sebastian Vettel would not be "afraid" of taking on one of Formula 1's other leading names as his team-mate but insists he has nothing to prove. The German can clinch a fourth world title in India on Sunday but has to face claims his remarkable success is largely down to having the best car. Red Bull resisted opportunities in the last 18 months to sign Lewis Hamilton, Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso. "One day maybe I will race alongside Kimi or Fernando," Vettel said. "It depends how long we stick around. But I am not afraid of that because you want to beat the guys on the track and you want to find out who is the best." Vettel, who has won the last five races in a row, needs only a fifth place in the Indian Grand Prix to be absolutely sure of the title. Only Ferrari's Fernando Alonso is mathematically able to beat him, but is 90 points behind with only 100 still available. The Spaniard needs to out-score Vettel by 16 points on Sunday to prolong the championship to the next race in Abu Dhabi next weekend. Vettel, who was talking in a BBC Sport interview to be broadcast ahead of the race on Sunday, rejected a suggestion that he needs to take on Alonso, Hamilton or Raikkonen in another car to prove his greatness to any doubters. "You can think about this a lot," he said. "I think we don't have to prove anything. I think we have proven enough. "We have had three fantastic years. This year has been fantastic. I believe things happen for a reason. "For sure you need the right package. We had a very strong package the last couple of years. I believe we had a very strong package in 2009, when we finished second in the championship. "With the experience I have today maybe 2009 would have been different. At the time I did the best I could. I did mistakes, I still do now, but the most important thing is I learn from them. "You can find lots of difficulties I had to face. [Last year] we got sent to the back of the grid in Abu Dhabi and had to come back, we had a nightmare race in Brazil. "We managed to come back [and seal the championship]. It was a bit tight in some places, a bit lucky. We worked very hard for what we have achieved basically, as a team. "For sure some people will think you have to do this and that. The most important is to prove something to yourself." Asked how he felt he compared as a driver to Hamilton and Alonso, Vettel said: "It's difficult because I don't know what they do. I can see what they do on the track. I don't know how much time they spend setting up the car, how much they care. "I'm sure we all care because no-one wants to drive a car that is set up badly, but for sure some people invest more time and some less. I don't think there is a right and wrong, it is what you feel happy with."

      <body>England coach Steve McNamara cut short his news conference ahead of their World Cup opener against Australia. McNamara walked out after six minutes as he was questioned on his selection decisions. Second row forward Gareth Hock was removed from the squad after a breach of discipline following England's 15-14 defeat by Italy in a warm-up game. Prop James Graham has not been selected for Saturday's opener with the Kangaroos at the Millennium Stadium. Hock told the BBC that he does not think his breach of discipline was serious enough for him to be removed from England's World Cup squad. The forward, 30, said he and some team-mates went on a night out after England's surprise defeat by Italy. McNamara refused to discuss the disciplinary issues during the media conference and no players were made available to speak. The England coach was questioned about absence of Graham from his 19-man squad, amid speculation that the former St Helens forward had been involved in the post-Italy game incident. "There are seven very good players not playing this week," McNamara said. "I'm certainly not going to talk about any individuals among those seven. "They are all great players, great people and I'm sure they'll get a part to play during the rest of the tournament." McNamara denied it had been a tough week for him ahead of the opener with Australia and has faith in his squad despite disciplinary issues. "It's been a week as a coach, simple as that, preparing a team getting ready to face Australia and a team that under-performed last week against Italy," he said. "That's been the nuts and the bolts of the job this week. "I think the world of that squad, every single one of them and they will all play a part during this World Cup." McNamara became frustrated as he was questioned on disciplinary issues and said: "I'm not going to answer any more questions on it. If you want to continue asking the questions, then we'll wrap up now." McNamara briefly went on to talk about the match against Australia but ended the session abruptly when asked about Hock. Australia coach Tim Sheens denied he was pleased to see England's troubled build-up to Saturday's game in Cardiff. "I made the comment earlier in the week that an embarrassed side is a dangerous side," he said. "Anyone involved in sport understands that when things go wrong, it can have the exact reverse effect." </body>

      <title>Fifa heading into choppy World Cup waters</title>
      <description>Fifa faces difficult years ahead with World Cups in Brazil, Russia and Qatar, says sports editor David Bond</description>

      <body>It is almost three years now since Fifa awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar respectively. In that time, world football's governing body has had to withstand numerous allegations of corruption surrounding the joint vote that decided the hosts of both tournaments. To add to the discontent, there has also been a purge of Fifa's executive committee, with eight members either suspended or forced to resign following claims of misconduct. Fifa president Sepp Blatter,  in England for the Football Association's 150th anniversary gala dinner on Saturday, will tell you that his beleaguered organisation is moving in the right direction. Or, to borrow one of his favourite analogies, he is steering the ship towards calmer seas. But, in many ways, the waters ahead look even choppier. By choosing Russia and Qatar to follow next year's World Cup in Brazil, Fifa has guaranteed itself another decade of problems and negative headlines. Fifa sources will tell you privately that for all the bad publicity around the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, there are far more concerns within the governing body about the tournament in Brazil. Never mind the street protests and social unrest, which are almost certain to be an issue next year, there are still question marks over transport, organisation and infrastructure in the South American country. Former England coach Fabio Capello, now in charge of the Russia national team, told reporters recently that he was worried about Brazil's creaking transport system and the demands of playing games in different parts of such a vast country, where temperatures and conditions vary greatly. That is not to say that Qatar is without its own problems. Fifa may have parked any decision on moving the 2022 World Cup from the stifling heat of a Qatari summer to the cooler temperatures of spring or winter, but the Gulf state's treatment of migrant workers following a Guardian investigation alleging slave labour is still to be addressed. No doubt that topic will be on the agenda next month, when Blatter heads a Fifa delegation that will meet Qatar's new ruler, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. As for Russia, it has received relatively little attention so far. All that has changed after Yaya Toure raised the possibility of a boycott of the 2018 World Cup after claiming he was racially abused during Manchester City's Champions League game against CSKA Moscow this week. While such incidents are sadly not new, it is the first time this issue has been so prominently linked to the World Cup. The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi are already facing the prospect of widespread protests aimed at Russia's new anti-gay legislation. But racism and attitudes towards homosexuality in Russia are just two examples of a deeper concern in the west about Vladimir Putin's government. Once the Sochi Games are out the way, Russia will find itself under even greater international scrutiny in the run-up to the 2018 World Cup. As emerging economies like China and Brazil become more and more powerful, so sports bodies have been trying to use their premium events to break into new territories and markets. Brazil, Russia and Qatar reflect that ambitious shift. But, by choosing these countries as hosts for the World Cup, Fifa has ensured it will be fighting major battles on three fronts. </body>

      <body>A man has been found guilty of murdering his business partner and throwing her down a well shaft in an attempt to gain a £1m inheritance. A jury at Reading Crown Court found Christopher Symons, 63, of Cambridge Street, Aylesbury, had killed Patricia Goodband, 76, in December. Her body was found concealed in the well in the grounds of her home near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, in January. Symons, who had denied murder, will be sentenced on Monday. The court earlier heard allegations that Symons "used" his sister Kathleen Adams and his lover Jennifer Creasey to hide his crime. Ms Adams, 74, of Aylesbury Road, Princes Risborough, was found not guilty of one count of perverting the course of justice. Creasey, 73, of Hale Road, Benson, Oxfordshire, was found guilty of one of two counts of the same charge. Symons' friend Robert Taft, 59, of Kings Close, Westcott, Aylesbury, had previously admitted perverting the course of justice and possession of ammunition without a certificate. Taft and Creasey will also be sentenced on Monday. Ms Goodband, who was last seen on 17 December, was reported missing by her daughter on 9 January. Her body was found on 21 January. During Symons' trial, the court heard Ms Goodband had been friends with him for more than 30 years and had run a road haulage and agricultural business with him from her home in Woodham. The prosecution said he killed her on 22 December in a "cold blooded, planned murder for financial gain", and his "motive was clear". A post-mortem examination found she died from head injuries. The defence had said much of the evidence against Mr Symons was "circumstantial and incomplete". Symons told police he dropped Mrs Goodband off at Milton Keynes station so she could go away over Christmas. His defence admitted this was untrue, but said Mr Symons was a man who lived a life of pretence and the fact he had lied did not mean he was guilty of murder. Det Supt Chris Ward from Thames Valley Police said Symons' actions were "pre-meditated and motivated purely by greed". "In order to inherit her property and share of their business, [he] devised a cruel and calculated plan to murder Patricia and make it appear as if she vanished without a trace," he said. "This has been a complex inquiry in which we have had to unpick all of Symons' lies in order to uncover the truth." </body>

      <title>Teenager sentenced for acid attack</title>
      <description>A 16-year-old boy is sentenced to eight years for an acid attack on a woman in Romford, east London.</description>

      <body>A 16-year-old boy has been sentenced to eight years and three months for an acid attack on a woman in east London. Tara Quigley, 28, suffered injuries to her face and upper body when acid was thrown at her as she answered the door at her home in Romford on 30 April. Liam Robert Sibbons pleaded guilty to a charge of throwing corrosive fluid on a person with intent to do grievous bodily harm (GBH). Sibbons will serve six years and three months in custody. He will be released on licence for the remainder of his sentence. The teenager can now be named after Judge David Radford lifted a reporting restriction. Prosecutor Martin Whitehouse told Snaresbrook Crown Court: "This was a horrific attack, involving a degree of brutality and callousness rarely encountered. "Almost, one might say, beyond comprehension." Miss Quigley, who did not know the teenager, has been left permanently scarred and will need regular treatment over the next four years. She suffered burns to 7% of her body, including her right arm, forearm, shoulder, chest, neck and face. The court heard that most of the burns went almost all the way through her skin and Miss Quigley has had two skin grafts which have only been 85% successful. In a victim impact statement, Miss Quigley, who was in court, said: "The attack has left me feeling as though my life has been blown apart." She added she was in constant pain and did not feel safe returning to her home. "I will have to live with this attack and the scars it has left me with for the rest of my life and nothing I can say or do will change that," she said. "I truly hope that the man responsible knows just what he has done and the grief and anguish he has caused to me and my entire family." Mr Whitehouse said Miss Quigley had been at home when she saw someone approaching the house. When she opened the door she was asked by the person if she was called Michelle. She replied no and the person walked off, however 10 minutes later there was a loud knock on the door. The prosecutor said: "Miss Quigley opened the front door and saw the same man. He was holding onto a white bottle with both hands. "He then pointed the bottle at Miss Quigley and squeezed." Mr Whitehouse said Miss Quigley felt an almost immediate burning sensation when the liquid came into contact with her skin. The court heard she shut the door and began to scream, and then ran into the kitchen and started splashing water on her face. An ambulance was called and Miss Quigley was taken to hospital for treatment. Sibbons received an acid burn to the left side of his chest during the attack. He had four previous convictions and was on bail at the time of the incident. Judge Radford said Sibbons had refused to explain why he carried out the attack. The judge said: "It was, in my judgment, a truly wicked offence, which clearly was premeditated." He added that the attack could have been a case of mistaken identity and a large amount of money had been found after the teenager was arrested. "Whether this was because you were being paid to commit this offence and there was some kind of mistake about the identity of the victim is a matter for speculation in the absence of candour and honesty on your part," the judge said. </body>

      <body>Scottish councils have imposed a pay deal on their staff after almost a year of negotiations failed to reach an agreement. Council staff other than teachers will get a 1% rise backdated to April of this year - and a further 1% rise next April. The decision was taken at a meeting of the council umbrella body Cosla. Cosla said it could not allow the "dragging of feet" by the Unison union to continue. "This cannot continue any longer - our employees deserve their pay rise now," said Cosla's human resources spokesman, Councillor Billy Hendry. "We have been in negotiations with the Scottish Joint Council trade unions for almost a full year after making an initial offer in November 2012. "The unions remain divided and the time has come to apply the deal." Mr Hendry added: "I am particularly pleased with the ground-breaking award of a living wage of £7.50 per hour in 2013/14, which will deliver real benefits for employees at the lower end of the pay scale, and an agreement to match the recommended figure due next month from the Living Wage Foundation for 2014/15, which will see a further living wage increase for the lowest paid." The pay deal does not apply to teachers. Earlier this week the largest teachers' union, the EIS, rejected changes to their terms and conditions of employment. The pay deal was conditional on accepting these changes. Mr Hendry continued: "It is deeply frustrating for me that I am not in a position to announce a pay increase at this time for our teaching workforce. "The decision by the EIS not to agree a deal has resulted in what we believe is an unnecessary delay. "Talks will continue in November which we hope will also bring this matter to a conclusion." </body>

      <title>Four jailed over weapons stash</title>
      <description>Four men are jailed after a stash of weapons and ammunition - including an Uzi sub-machine gun with silencer - was found at a railway station.</description>

      <body>Four men have been jailed after a stash of weapons and ammunition - including an Uzi sub-machine gun with silencer - was found at a railway station. Serving soldier William Dempsey left bags of weapons at Carlisle station after getting off a train to Glasgow. He collected them from James Ashdown in Kent. They were destined for Barry Kelly and Craig Colquhoun in Scotland. Dempsey and Ashdown were each jailed for eight years. Kelly was given nine years and Colquhoun seven years. Dempsey and Ashdown had previously admitted conspiracy to buy or sell illegal firearms. Kelly and Darvel were found guilty by a jury of the same offences earlier this month. Liverpool Crown Court heard how Dempsey, 29, from Paisley, left two Army camouflage bags containing the Uzi sub-machine gun, silencer, a handgun and a sawn-off double-barrelled shotgun with two cleaners at the station. He asked them to look after the bags for him as he thought he was being followed. The court heard that the mortarman with the 5th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, was dressed in desert combat uniform and had been exhibiting "somewhat bizarre behaviour". He told staff there were snipers at the station. He had collected the firearms from his friend Ashdown, 32, in Canterbury, where Dempsey's barracks were. The court heard how the bags, found on 17 August last year, also contained Dempsey's identification papers and 194 rounds of ammunition which had his name embroidered on them. They were destined for Kelly, 34, from Darvel, Ayrshire, and Colquhoun, 28, from Barrhead. A search at Dempsey's barracks uncovered a handgun-shaped crossbow, several metal tipped arrows and large military batteries. The battalion duty officer confirmed to British Transport Police that no weapons were missing from the armoury. British Transport Police said Dempsey's mobile phone revealed messages between him and Ashdown regarding large cash payments for "toys" - items believed to be the firearms seized at Carlisle. Further investigation revealed links to both Colquhoun and Kelly. On 16 August last year Colquhoun was captured on CCTV at the Royal Bank of Scotland in Paisley paying £3,500 into Dempsey's account. While arresting Kelly, Ashdown and Colquhoun police found £20,000 hidden in the loft of Kelly's house. Prosecutor Nicholas Kennedy said it was not known where the Uzi and handgun were from but the shotgun had been stolen in a burglary at farm buildings in Maidstone in February 2007. Sentencing the four, Judge Robert Warnock said: "I am wholly satisfied that they [the weapons] were destined for use in serious crime and had a clear potential for causing serious injury and death. "Had these firearms reached their intended recipients, I have no doubt they would have significantly contributed to the upward spiral of gun crime in this country." The judge told Demspey he had used his uniform to hide what he was doing on the day he was arrested. "For reasons principally to do with your abuse of alcohol and drugs, you abandoned the firearms at Carlisle station," he said. "I make it clear, however, that these actions were not motivated by remorse or insight but your befuddled and confused thinking brought on by your alcohol and drug abuse and your consequential paranoia and instability." The judge told Kelly he was "clearly a relatively sophisticated criminal who is well-versed in the use and abuse of mobile phone technology". He said his "employee" Colquhoun was a peripheral player in the conspiracy. The court heard that Ashdown, of no fixed address, was an active street dealer of drugs who was motivated to make money to fund his cocaine habit. He was jailed for an additional three years for possession and intent to supply cocaine in a separate case. Mitigating for Dempsey, David Thompson said his client had joined the Army at the age of 17 and had served in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. He was described as a "reliable and competent soldier" but his life began to go downhill last July. He had alcohol and drug problems and had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after his battleground stints. At the time he entered the firearms conspiracy he had accumulated a drug debt of £5,000. Mr Thompson said he was exposed to influences in his home town of Paisley - which he had joined the Army to get away from when he was younger. He said Dempsey "in effect abandoned the consignment at the rail station and disappeared into town." "He tells me he knew he was going to be arrested and was enjoying a final pint of beer." Mr Thompson said it was "a crying shame" that the defendant had become involved in a conspiracy "diametrically opposed" to the 12 years of service he had given to his country. "He is filled with remorse for getting involved and the shame he has brought upon his regiment," the barrister said. The court heard that Kelly maintained his innocence. Following sentencing, Det Ch Insp Simon Taylor, who led British Transport Police's investigation, said: "These four clearly intended to put illegal firearms on to the streets of Scotland and it is a fair assumption that they would have been used to commit criminal acts or to intimidate people. "In uncovering and unravelling the complex conspiracy BTP, in partnership with Kent Police and Police Scotland, have taken this potential threat out of circulation and ensured the conviction of four dangerous men." </body>

      <body>A second letter bomb addressed to a serving senior police officer has been discovered at a mail sorting office in Northern Ireland. The package was found at a Royal Mail depot in Lisburn, County Antrim. It comes hours after a device in a package addressed to the PSNI chief constable was intercepted at a sorting office in north Belfast. Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr said it was thought that dissident republicans were behind both incidents. He also blamed dissidents for pipe bomb attacks on police vehicles in Londonderry and the outskirts of Belfast over the last three days. "All four, along with other attacks this months, have been designed to kill police officers," he told a press conference on Friday. "We are very lucky we are not dealing with a fatality this morning." An Army bomb team dealt with the device at Mallusk, north Belfast, early on Friday. It had been addressed to Matt Baggott at police headquarters in Knock, east Belfast. Later, a delivery office at Linenhall Street, Lisburn, was evacuated following the discovery of a suspicious object. The police said that both packages contained a viable device. Justice Minister David Ford said of the first device: "Those who sent this device have no concern whatsoever for the staff at the Mallusk sorting office, whose vigilance is to be commended." Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said the Mallusk attack was "callous and reckless". "Those responsible for this device have almost no support and have demonstrated a blatant disregard for the safety of those who could have been injured," she said. "The chief constable undertakes a challenging role in delivering community policing in a difficult environment." A spokeswoman for Royal Mail said: "The Northern Ireland mail centre at Mallusk was evacuated overnight due to a suspect package. "Unfortunately there will be an effect on deliveries today and we apologise for any inconvenience this may cause." Police have appealed for the public to be vigilant and report anything that looks suspicious. </body>

      <body>A man has been found guilty of the attempted murder of County Armagh woman Natasha McShane and her friend Stacy Jurich in Chicago three years ago. Heriberto Viramontes, 34, was convicted at Cook County Criminal Court in the US city on Thursday. The pair were attacked and robbed in the early hours of 23 April, 2010. Ms McShane, who had been attending the University of Illinois at the time of the assault, has been left with severe brain damage. Just before 18:00 local time - midnight UK time - on Thursday, her family, along with Stacy Jurich and her family, were called for the verdict. The trial lasted five days, it took three and a half hours to find Viramontes guilty on all charges. There were emotional scenes as the verdicts were delivered. Shortly afterwards, a statement written by Natasha's brother, Conor, was read out to the press by the state's attorney. "This crime against my sister has changed my life forever. It has had a devastating impact on our entire family," the statement said. Conor McShane said the family was pleased and relieved at the verdicts. But he also said that Natasha's life had been ruined by the attack. She has been left unable to talk or walk unaided. Stacy Jurich said that the time since the attack had been the most difficult in her life. "We have had a lot of support from our families, friends and complete strangers," she said. "But the last three and a half years have been the hardest time in my entire life. Not only was it a struggle for me, but it has been a struggle to face what happened to my best friend, Natasha - something I will never forget." Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez said: "Chicago is a beautiful city, it is a shame that someone like Natasha McShane, who was here to continue her schooling, someone who was visiting from Ireland, that she was not able to enjoy all the beauty that Chicago has to offer. "Instead of welcoming our visitors with an open heart, she was confronted with a baseball bat. I am very pleased that this man has been held responsible for the brutal and senseless beating of both Stacy Jurich and Natasha McShane." Viramontes faces between six and 120 years in prison. In July, his accomplice Marcy Cruz was jailed for 22 years after pleading guilty to two counts of attempted murder over the attack. </body>

      <body>A recycling firm has been fined £90,000 after an employee lost an arm in an accident which was "waiting to happen". Neath Port Talbot Recycling Ltd was also ordered to pay £50,000 costs following the incident in 2011. Swansea Crown court heard a similar incident happened in 2007 and over the following years the firm had been warned about its health and safety measures. The company said it deeply regretted what happened to employee Stephen John. The court was told how the 57-year-old was asked to clean a conveyor belt which had become blocked with a sticky black substance known as flack. The company did not have any risk assessment or safe system of work for completing this task, and experienced employees like Mr John had developed their own way of cleaning the conveyor belt roller. This system of work was devised partly because the control switch was located some distance away from the actual conveyor. To clean the rollers, one employee stood by the control switch, which is out of sight from the conveyor, and a second person inserted a bar and scraped the flack from the roller. He then inserted his arm to wipe away the flack. A command was given to the switch controller and the conveyor was started and stopped quickly. The process was repeated until the roller was clean. The court heard on the day of the incident, Mr John inserted his arm and was wiping the flack away. He then passed the bar to a work colleague. The switch controller misinterpreted this as a signal and started the conveyor. Mr John's right forearm was trapped and amputated by the conveyor belt. Speaking after the hearing, Health and Safety Executive (HSE) inspector Sarah Baldwin-Jones said the potential for greater harm or a fatal accident was also a realistic possibility. "The company failed to fully guard the conveyor around the tail end roller and this failure resulted in employees having access to dangerous parts of the machine," she said. "The risk of entrapment is well known in the industry, and this company could have taken simple steps to fit guarding. "There was also no line of sight between Mr John and the employee operating the machinery and the company failed to carry out a risk assessment when the conveyor was installed. "They also failed to devise a safe way of cleaning the rollers and to instruct employees on how to clean them safely." Neath Port Talbot Recycling of Crymlyn Burrows, Swansea, pleaded guilty to two safety breaches. Managing director Will Watson told BBC Wales the company deeply regretted what had happened and that issues at the plant had now been addressed. </body>

      <body>A Welsh government minister has been criticised for giving "evasive" answers to an assembly committee. The assembly's environment committee said Natural Resources Minister Alun Davies gave them contradictory information about his portfolio. Members condemned his department for financial management and planning failures, including "basic errors" in its draft budget. The Welsh government said issues raised were "flawed and inaccurate". In a letter to the Finance Committee about the Natural Resources department's budget, the AMs said: "We are disappointed with the timeliness of information provided by the minister, and the oral evidence session, where a number of questions were evaded or contradictory information provided. "We believe that this is an indicator of problems at the heart of financial management and planning of this department and we will continue to keep a very close eye on these issues both in-year and at future budget rounds. "We believe the department's approach to financial management hinders general transparency. We are therefore unable to assess whether the budget is appropriately prioritised and is providing value for money." Mr Davies was criticised after £342m of farm subsidy payments were left out of the government's supplementary budget earlier this year due to what he called an "administrative error". Committee members said that while the minister said there would be no impact on farmers, "there is a discrepancy between officials and the minister about whether or not this shortfall will need to be covered from other areas within the Welsh Government budget". The Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, William Powell, said that Mr Davies' performance before the Environment Committee was "embarrassing" and showed a "lack of competence". "The Minister's budget included a number of basic errors, such as referring to schemes and policy areas that have ceased to exist," said Mr Powell. The Welsh government responded strongly to the critical letter. A spokesperson said: "The majority of the issues raised are simply flawed and inaccurate and we do not accept them. "The content and tone of the letter are also wholly misleading. "The Minister for Natural Resources and Food will be writing to the Chair of the Environment Committee shortly to address the issues raised." </body>

      <title>Militants raid north Nigerian city</title>
      <description>Militants engage security forces in a long gun battle in a key city in northern Nigeria, while the army says it has killed 74 militants elsewhere.</description>

      <body>Suspected Boko Haram militants have engaged security forces in a lengthy gun battle and raided a hospital in the northern Nigerian city of Damaturu. Residents told the BBC that it was a "big, audacious attack" and that assailants stole drugs from the hospital and drove off in ambulances. Meanwhile, the military said it had killed 74 suspected Boko Haram militants in a raid in Borno state. Authorities have recently stepped up their campaign against the militants. North-eastern Nigeria is the focus of an insurgency by the group that began in 2009 and aims to create an Islamic state. President Goodluck Jonathan urged the military to up its campaign against Boko Haram five months ago. Damaturu is the main city in Yobe state, which lies to the west of Borno. It has been calm for more than a year, and there is a large military presence in there. Nonetheless, gunfire rocked the city for some seven hours after a group of about 20 gunmen - some in military uniform - targeted the hospital late on Thursday. Clashes between militants and the security forces spread to other parts of the city. A health worker described seeing a police vehicle ferrying corpses to the mortuary. The resident who described the attack as "audacious" said the gunfire was heavy, continuous, and loud. He also said that people in Damaturu were surprised that it had taken the military at least an hour to respond. Authorities later imposed a 24-hour curfew, and streets were deserted on Friday. The military raid in Borno state involved "ground and aerial assault" and "led to the destruction of the identified terrorist camps," said army spokesman Lt Mohammed Dole. Lt Dole said the latest raid had been carried out on Thursday and that two soldiers had been wounded. The BBC's Will Ross reports from Nigeria that it seems surprising that Boko Haram camps are still being found, given all the resources available to the army. The army's claims about military operations against the group are hard to verify - there has been no mobile phone network in Borno state since the latest offensive was launched. Nigeria's campaign has been criticised by human rights groups. Amnesty International said earlier this month that hundreds had died in detention in north-eastern Nigeria, some from starvation or extra-judicial killings. Nigeria's interior said the report was "not true". </body>

      <description>Kenya's interior minister fires 15 immigration officers over security lapses as investigations into the Westgate shopping centre siege continue.</description>

      <body>Kenya's interior minister has sacked 15 immigration officers as investigations into the Westgate mall siege continue. Joseph Ole Lenku said the officials had endangered national security by issuing ID documents to illegal immigrants. He also said the government would start repatriating Somali refugees to prevent further attacks. At least 67 people died when militants from the Somali Islamist al-Shabab group attacked the Nairobi shopping centre last month. Kenya is host to the largest refugee camp in the world, Dadaab - home to about half a million people - near the Somali border, while it is believed that more than 30,000 Somali refugees live in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, alone. Mr Lenku said the sacked immigration officers would appear in court to face the law. The government would also be carrying out a thorough audit of identity cards and passports issued in the country in the last two years, he said. "This exercise will enable us flush out all those who have been issued with illegal passports and other identification documents," Kenya's Star newspaper quoted him as saying. "We have welcomed with open arms, refugees fleeing from insecurity in neighbouring countries but we won't allow them to harm us," he added in his address to journalists in Nairobi. "Because of the returning calm in some parts of the Federal Republic of Somali, the process of repatriating Somali refugees has started," he said. Kenya has about 4,000 troops in the south of Somalia as part of the UN-backed African Union force which has made significant advances against al-Shabab in the last two years, recapturing the area's main cities. But the militants still control many smaller towns and large rural areas of southern Somalia. The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Nairobi says this is not the first time those fleeing the violence in neighbouring Somalia have been thrust uncomfortably into the spotlight. Even before Westgate, some politicians had blamed elements in the country's Dadaab refugee camp for attacks inside Kenya, he says. Previous attempts to repatriate Somali refugees have met with strong resistance, both from the UN and Kenya's own courts, our reporter adds. But more than a month after the attack on the shopping mall, the Kenyan government is under pressure - both its handling of intelligence and its response to the attack itself have been called into question, he says. Somalia's envoy to Kenya, Mohamed Ali Nur, has warned against blaming the refugees. "These refugees who are in the camps are innocent people. I want to say that the refugees themselves have been victims. Some of them were killed, some women were raped, and kids were killed," Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper quoted him as saying on Tuesday. Al-Shabab, which is part of the al-Qaeda network, is banned as a terrorist group by both the US and the UK and is believed to have between 7,000 and 9,000 fighters. Its members are fighting to create an Islamic state in Somalia and the group said it had staged the Westgate attack in response to Kenya's presence on Somali territory. Officials initially said 10 to 15 gunmen were involved, but CCTV footage appears to show only four militants, who the Kenyan military say all died by the end of the siege. The BBC's Newsnight programme has revealed that one of the four attackers is suspected of being a 23-year-old Somalia-born Norwegian national, Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow. </body>

      <title>China court rejects Bo Xilai appeal</title>
      <description>A high court in China has rejected the appeal of top politician Bo Xilai, jailed for life for bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power.</description>

      <body>A Chinese court has rejected the appeal of former politician Bo Xilai and upheld his life sentence for bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power. The former Chongqing Communist Party leader was convicted of the charges in September. He was removed from office in 2012 amid a scandal which saw his wife convicted of a British businessman's murder. The high court in Shandong, the province where Bo's trial was held, accepted his appeal earlier this month. "The facts of the first instance verdict are clear, the evidence is reliable, sufficient and the sentence is appropriate," the high court said in its ruling, which was posted on its website. "The court rules as follows: reject the appeal, uphold the original verdict. This verdict is the final ruling." The hearing appeared to have been brief, with the verdict coming about an hour after a convoy believed to be carrying Bo was seen arriving at the court. Footage from state broadcaster CCTV showed Bo's elder son, Li Wangzhi, in court with other relatives. Bo only receives one chance to appeal and his sentence is now final. He could submit a complaint to the Supreme People's Court in Beijing, but the vast majority of such complaints are rejected and do not result in another trial, reports the BBC's Celia Hatton in Beijing. Correspondents said few expected Bo's conviction to be overturned. The courts are controlled by the ruling Communist Party, from which Bo was expelled from last year. Bo Xilai, the charismatic former party chief in the city of Chongqing in south-western China, was a member of the powerful politburo - one of the 25 most senior party officials in the country. But he was removed from office last year amid a scandal which began when his deputy, Wang Lijun, sought refuge in the US consulate in Chengdu. The incident prompted an investigation into the death of British businessman Neil Heywood. Bo Xilai's wife, Gu Kailai, was eventually convicted of Mr Heywood's murder - a crime caused, the court said, by a financial dispute. Wang was also jailed for 15 years for helping Gu cover up the murder. Bo himself was found guilty of taking bribes amounting to 20m yuan ($3.3m, £2m) either personally or through his family. He was also accused of abusing his office by using his position to cover up for his wife's crime. Bo's supporters, however, believe he is the victim of a political purge. His downfall came as China prepared for its once-in-a-decade leadership transfer, as one generation of leaders made way for the next. Bo had been seen as a candidate for the very top, until his fall from grace. It was the biggest political shake-up to hit China's ruling elite in decades. The final verdict in the Bo case comes weeks before the Communist Party holds a major meeting in November to set economic policy. </body>

      <title>North Korea returns six S Koreans</title>
      <description>North Korea returns six South Korean men, aged between 27 and 67, to their homeland, South Korean officials say, in a rare handover.</description>

      <body>North Korea has returned six South Korean men to their homeland, South Korean officials say, in a rare move. The men, between the ages of 27 and 67, were handed over on Friday at the truce village of Panmunjom, on the border between the two countries. Their names were not released and details surrounding their detention in the North remain unclear. The two Koreas remain technically at war, as the 1950-53 conflict ended in an armistice and not a peace treaty. Pyongyang's Red Cross informed Seoul that the men would be handed back via Panmunjom on Thursday, a statement from South Korea's Unification Ministry said. Officials said the group would be taken to South Korea's spy agency to face questions over their presence in North Korea. The South Korean government said that at first glance, the men were not on the list of those abducted by the North. One possibility is that they may have crossed into North Korea illegally from China, the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul says. Unofficial travel to North Korea by private citizens from South Korea is illegal, Pyongyang's state news agency announced the detention of several unnamed South Korean nationals in 2010 and there is speculation that they may be among those returned, our correspondent adds. The move by North Korea is seen as a gesture of reconciliation following the cancellation of reunions for families split by the division of the Korean peninsula at the end of the Korean War which were planned for last month. Tensions between the two Koreas rose earlier this year, after North Korea's third nuclear test in February. </body>

      <title>US spying 'may harm terror fight'</title>
      <description>EU leaders meeting in Brussels say distrust of the US over spying could harm intelligence-gathering in the fight against terrorism.</description>

      <body>EU leaders meeting in Brussels said distrust of the US over spying could harm the fight against terrorism. A statement agreed by the leaders said that "a lack of trust could prejudice" intelligence-gathering co-operation. German spy chiefs are travelling to Washington next week to press for action over the alleged monitoring of Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone. Both Germany and France want talks with the US to find a new "understanding" by the end of the year. As well as the bugging of Mrs Merkel's phone, there are claims the US National Security Agency (NSA) has monitored millions of telephone calls by both German and French citizens. Spain on Friday followed Germany and France in summoning the US ambassador to explain reports of spying on the country. The UK's Guardian newspaper has reported that it obtained a confidential memo from the NSA suggesting it had monitored the phones of 35 world leaders. The latest revelations have been sourced to US whistleblower Edward Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who fled the country earlier this year and is now in Russia. US state department spokesperson Jen Psaki said a review of US intelligence gathering, called for by President Obama, would look at how it affects foreign policy. The "high level group of outside experts... will consider as part of this how we can maintain the public's trust, how the surveillance impacts our foreign policy, particularly in an age when more and more information is becoming public," she said. The EU leaders' statement, released earlier on Friday, reflected their conclusions following talks on Thursday. It said the recent intelligence issues had raised "deep concerns" among European citizens. The statement said the leaders "underlined the close relationship between Europe and the USA and the value of that partnership". "[The leaders] stressed that intelligence-gathering is a vital element in the fight against terrorism," it continued. And it went on: "A lack of trust could prejudice the necessary cooperation in the field of intelligence-gathering." "The heads of state or government took note of the intention of France and Germany to seek bilateral talks with the USA with the aim of finding before the end of the year an understanding on mutual relations in that field," the leaders' statement also said. "They noted that other EU countries are welcome to join this initiative." French President Francois Hollande said the aim of the initiative "is about knowing about the past and setting a framework for the future and putting an end to monitoring mechanisms that are not controlled". Germany and France said they are proposing talks with the US to settle the row by the end of the year. But Mrs Merkel stressed Berlin and Paris would be making their own separate approaches to Washington. BBC Europe editor Gavin Hewitt says the French and Germans are looking for a new set of rules with a "no spying pact" at the core. He says this would mirror an arrangement the United States has had with Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada since just after World War II. That secret intelligence-sharing operation is known as Five Eyes. Mrs Merkel said she did not know the exact details of the Five Eyes arrangement so could not say whether that is exactly what Germany is seeking, but added: "We need something clear-cut, in line with the spirit of an alliance". UK Prime Minister David Cameron acknowledged the UK's "unique partnership" with the US regarding security but said: "I understand what others want to do and support that, as I think does President Obama". When asked by the BBC if the US had ever monitored Mr Cameron's phone, White House National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said: "His communications have not, are not and will not be monitored by the US." 'Look to the future' The spying revelations have overshadowed other issues at the EU summit in Brussels, including the Mediterranean migration problem, which framed the agenda of Friday's talks. Italian authorities said they had intercepted some 800 migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean as the EU leaders prepared to meet. A number leaders indicated their support for the French and German position. Belgian Prime Minister Elio di Rupo said: "The objective must remain the same - to fight against terrorism but also respect privacy. "Everyone can understand the need for exceptional measures given the danger of terrorism... but we are not in the position where we should spy on each other." Swedish PM Fredrik Reinfeldt said it was "completely unacceptable" to eavesdrop on the leader of an ally, a view echoed by Italian PM Enrico Letta, who added: "We want the truth." Other leaders signalled the need to move on. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said: "The main thing is that we look to the future. The trans-Atlantic partnership was, and is, important." Mrs Merkel had raised her concerns with US President Barack Obama in a call on Wednesday. White House spokesman Jay Carney later said Mr Obama had assured Mrs Merkel that her phone was not being listened to now and would not be in the future. However, his statement left open the question of whether calls had been listened to in the past. </body>

      <title>Women gain as gender gap 'narrows'</title>
      <description>The gender gap is narrowing across the world, a World Economic Forum report suggests, with Nordic countries leading the way but Arab nations lagging behind.</description>

      <body>The gap between men and women has narrowed slightly in the past year in most countries, according to a World Economic Forum (WEF) report. Iceland, Finland and Norway top the list of 136 nations, based on political participation, economic equality and rights like education and health. The Middle East and North Africa were the only regions not to improve in the past year, with Yemen at the bottom. The Philippines and Nicaragua both feature in the top 10. The WEF has produced the report annually for the past eight years. The release of this year's edition comes as the BBC rounds off a month-long focus on women and gender around the world with a major event at Broadcasting House in London. One hundred women from all around the world are gathering for a day of debate and discussion as the 100 Women season comes to an end. Iceland's position at the top of the WEF rankings was the fifth year in a row the country has been named the world's most equal. Report founder and co-author Saadia Zahidi told the BBC that since the WEF began compiling the index in 2006, 80% of countries had made progress. "What's worrying though is that 20% of countries have made no progress or are falling behind," she said. She singled out the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia as countries that had invested in education and health, but had not integrated women into the economy. Nadia al-Sakkaf, editor of the English-language Yemen Times, in London for the 100 Women conference, told the BBC that she had stopped counting the years her country had languished at the bottom of the equality list. "It comes down to everyday life. We had three women running for president in 2006. We have lots of women in senior positions," she said. "But our levels of maternal mortality are very high, and 35% of girls aged 6-14 years old are not in school." Human capital Saadia Zahidi of the WEF said that by contrast many sub-Saharan countries had not invested in women, but through necessity they played a major role in the economy. Nordic countries continued to lead the way because they had a long history of investing in people, she said. "They are small economies with small populations; they recognise that talent matters, and that talent has to be men and women. Overall, the report, entitled Global Gender Gap Report 2013, found Iceland to be the most advanced country in the world in terms of gender equality for the fifth year running. Iceland, Finland (second), Norway (third) and Sweden (fourth) had all closed over 80% of the gender gap, where 100% would represent full equality. The highest-ranked Asian nation was the Philippines (fifth), praised for its success in health, education and economic participation. Asia's major economies performed poorly, with China in 69th place and Japan 105th. Nicaragua in 10th place was the highest positioned country in North and South America, and was praised for a "strong performance" in terms of political empowerment. Among major world economies Germany ranked 14th (down one), the UK held its position at 18, with Canada at 20 and the United States 23rd. On matters of health and survival, the report finds that 96% of the gap has now closed. In terms of education, the global gender gap is 93% closed, with 25 countries now judged to deliver equal treatment to boys and girls at school. It is a different picture on the core issue of economic equality, where the gender gap has closed by 60%. In developing and developed countries alike, women's presence in economic leadership positions is limited. And while women have made small gains in political representation - 2% this year - only 21% of that global gender gap has closed Ms Zahidi said the idea of the report was not to remind poor countries that they had fewer opportunities than rich countries, but to give them a tool to improve the situation. "Women make up one half of the human capital available to any economy and any company; if that talent isn't integrated, that is going to be a loss for both women and men," she said. </body>

      <body>At least one person has died and dozens more are injured in an explosion and fire that tore through a sweet factory in northern Mexico. A boiler is believed to have exploded in the Dulces Blueberry factory at an industrial park in Ciudad Juarez, causing the ceiling to collapse. About 300 people were said to be in the factory at the time and several are still unaccounted for. Fire crews and about 30 ambulances were at the scene. Ciudad Juarez Civil Protection Director Fernando Mota said firefighters found a body inside the factory and that six of the injured were in a serious condition. He said several workers were missing and could be trapped inside the building. "We're still searching the area to see if there are more dead," he added. Footage from the scene showed local people gathering outside, many of them in tears as they awaited news of friends or relatives. Paramedics were treating the injured, some of whom were badly burned. Ciudad Juarez is in the state of Chihuahua on the border with the US state of Texas. Factories such as the one affected, known as maquiladoras, are located in a free trade zone between the United States and Mexico. They are estimated to employ more than one million Mexicans. The BBC's Will Grant in Mexico City says maquiladoras are often criticised by labour rights groups for their low wages and poor working conditions, as they try to compete with China to manufacture cheap goods for the US market. </body>

      <title>Cuba to scrap two-currency system</title>
      <description>Cuba is to scrap its divisive two-currency system in the latest financial reform rolled out by President Raul Castro, official media report.</description>

      <body>Cuba is to scrap its two-currency system in the latest financial reform rolled out by President Raul Castro, official media report. Since 1994 Cuba has had two currencies, one pegged to the US dollar and the other worth only a fraction of that. The more valuable convertible peso (CUC) was reserved for use in the tourism sector and foreign trade. Now its value will be gradually unified with the lower-value CUP, ending a system resented by ordinary Cubans. The Cuban economy is almost entirely state-run and the tourism sector has boomed since the collapse of the Soviet Union plunged Cuba into economic isolation and hardship. The two-currency system was supposed to protect Cuba's fragile economy but angered locals paid in the much lower-value CUP and denied access to goods only available for those with convertible pesos. The policy exacerbated the creation of a two-tier class system in Cuba which divided privileged Cubans with access to the lucrative tourist and foreign-trade sectors from those working in the local economy - all-too-visibly contradicting Cuba's supposedly egalitarian society. The council of ministers has approved a timetable for implementing "measures that will lead to monetary and exchange unification", the official Communist Party newspaper Granma said. Unification is "imperative to guarantee the re-establishment of the Cuban peso's value and its role as money, that is as a unit of accounting, means of payment and savings", it said. It gave no details of how quickly the change would be implemented, though Reuters news agency quoted Cuban economists as saying it would take about 18 months. </body>

      <title>Car bomb targets Syrian mosque</title>
      <description>At least 20 have been killed and many others injured in a car bomb blast outside a mosque in Syria's Damascus province, activists say.</description>

      <body>At least 20 people including children have been reported killed in a car bomb blast in Syria, outside a mosque in a town in Damascus province. The blast, in the town of Suq Wadi Barada, came just before the end of Friday prayers and brought down the mosque's entrances. It was not clear who had carried out the attack. Meanwhile, Norway has turned down a request to help the UN dismantle Syria's chemical weapons arsenal. The UN has set a deadline of mid-2014 for the weapons to be destroyed. Sweden has offered to provide an air force unit to transport the weapons. But Norway, asked by the US to help destroy the arms, said it was "not the most suitable location" for the work. At least three children were among the dead and dozens more wounded in Friday's car bombing, UK-based activist group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. While Suq Wadi Barada was under opposition control, government forces were positioned just outside the town, it said. State news agency Sana said one of the victims was aged seven. It blamed opposition forces, saying the bomb exploded while it was being assembled. Rebel leaders blamed government troops. Car bombs have become a common, deadly occurrence in the long-running conflict. Earlier this week, a truck bomb in the central city of Hama killed at least 30 and wounded dozens more. Observatory figures show the 31-month conflict has killed more than 115,000 people. More than five million people are displaced inside Syria, and another two million have fled the country as refugees, according to the UNHCR. In other developments on Friday, government troops appeared to have ambushed a rebel position near the capital, part of an offensive on rebel-held areas around Damascus. State media said 40 rebels had died, while activists reported 20 deaths. The area is part of Eastern Ghouta region, scene of August's poison gas attack which killed hundreds of civilians and prompted a UN Security Council resolution calling for the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal. Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) issued a warning Friday that continuous heavy bombing had forced 130,000 people out of al-Safira in the north. They said aid agencies could not cope with the numbers as winter approaches. "These people arrive in areas that already host a large number of displaced people, where the rare humanitarian players that are present are faced with huge needs," Marie-Noelle Rodrigue, MSF head of operations said in a statement. Fighting has also spread to northern Lebanon. The northern city of Tripoli has seen five days of street battles between supporters and opponents of the Syrian regime, killing five and injuring more than 40. </body>

      <title>Syria: Polio epidemic fears grow</title>
      <description>The number of suspected cases of polio among children in Syria is believed to have risen sharply, with at least 22 people now thought to be suffering from the disease, health officials say.</description>

      <body>At least 22 people - most of them babies and toddlers - are now believed to have contracted polio in Syria, the World Health Organization has reported. If confirmed, it would be the first outbreak of the disease there in 14 years. Syria's Health Ministry began an immunisation drive on Thursday. Before Syria's civil war began in 2011, some 95% of children were vaccinated against the disease. Now, Unicef estimates 500,000 children have not been immunised. WHO said the suspected outbreak centres on the eastern province of Deir Ezzor. "There is a cluster of 22 acute flaccid paralysis cases that is being investigated in that area," WHO spokesman Oliver Rosenbauer told Reuters news agency. "Everybody is treating this as an outbreak and is in outbreak response mode." Two cases have already been confirmed by laboratory tests while the WHO expects final laboratory confirmation on the remaining 20 cases next week. There are more than 100,000 children, all under age five, now at risk of polio in Deir Ezzor province alone, which has been caught in fierce battles between Syrian government forces and opposition fighters. The city of Deir Ezzor remains partially controlled by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, while the countryside is in the hands of the opposition. The WHO is now working with the UN, Syria's Health Ministry and other agencies on a mass immunisation programme. But it is expected to be a difficult undertaking, says the BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva, given the widespread insecurity and estimates that over half of Syria's medical professionals have left the country. More than four million Syrians have been displaced internally by the conflict and generally live in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. The WHO has already reported increases in cases of measles, typhoid and hepatitis A. Aid agencies are also developing emergency immunisation plans for Syrian refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Egypt. "Obviously, we're extremely worried about the situation," Simon Ingram, a spokesman for Unicef's operations in the Middle East, told the BBC. "People are flooding across borders in an uncontrolled manner and this increases the possibilities and means by which the virus can spread." The highly contagious disease is most often spread by consuming food or liquid contaminated with faeces. Polio has been largely eradicated in developed countries but remains endemic in Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Worldwide, polio cases have fallen from an estimated 350,000 at the start of a WHO-led immunisation campaign in 1988 to just 223 reported cases last year. There is no known cure, though a series of vaccinations can confer immunity. Young children are particularly susceptible to paralytic polio, the most serious form of the disease. </body>

      <body>A former National Security Agency (NSA) chief giving off-the-record interviews on a high-speed train has had his remarks reported live on Twitter. General Michael Hayden was talking off-the-record to journalists by phone when he was overheard by another passenger, a former political activist. Tom Matzzie said he waited half an hour before live-tweeting comments about US renditions and a "famous BlackBerry". The comments went viral on news websites and late-night television. Gen Hayden, who was alerted to the Twitter feed within about 15 minutes, then offered an interview to Mr Matzzie, who is now head of a company called Ethical Electric. "I just had a very nice conversation with Michael Hayden. He was a gentleman and we disagree," Mr Matzzie later tweeted. The two men were on a high-speed Acela train travelling from Washington, DC to New York late on Thursday afternoon. Mr Matzzie began tweeting details of the conversations from what he said was a distance of 8ft (about 2.4m) away. "On Acela listening to former NSA spy boss Michael Hayden give 'off record' interviews. I feel like I'm in the NSA. Except I'm in public," Mr Matzzie's Twitter feed read. The National Security Agency has come under intense criticism after revelations by ex-CIA contractor Edward Snowden that US intelligence conducted extensive web and phone surveillance on targets at home and abroad. Mr Snowden now faces espionage charges in the US and has been granted temporary asylum in Russia. Gen Hayden has defended his former agency's operations in the past and Mr Matzzie wrote that Thursday's interviews were also focused on NSA surveillance of foreign allies. As the former head of MoveOn.org Political Action, Mr Matzzie once campaigned against the US-led war in Iraq. He made clear his own feelings about the former NSA and CIA chief with a tweet reading, "There is a faint smell of sulfur on the train." He said Gen Hayden asked journalists to refer to him as a "former senior administration official" for comments described as "disparaging" to President Barack Obama's administration. Gen Hayden later gave a statement to the Reuters news agency saying he "didn't criticise" the president. "I actually said these are very difficult issues. I said I had political guidance, too, that limited the things that I did when I was director of NSA. Now that political guidance is going to be more robust. It wasn't a criticism," Gen Hayden said. </body>

      <title>JonBenet parents 'should be charged'</title>
      <description>In 1999 a Colorado grand jury voted to charge the parents of slain child beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey in her 1996 murder, court documents show.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24675182</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70722000/jpg/_70722945_jonbenet.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>A Colorado grand jury was prepared to charge the parents of a slain six-year-old beauty queen in her death, newly released court documents in the 17-year-old murder case show. The panel voted in 1999 to charge JonBenet Ramsey's parents with fatal child abuse and "accessory to a crime". But prosecutors declined to try John and Patsy Ramsey on any charges. JonBenet's body was found brutally beaten and strangled in her Boulder, Colorado, home in December 1996. The Ramseys always maintained their innocence. Lin Wood, a lawyer for John Ramsey, said the documents released on Friday meant "absolutely zero" to the investigation. "The documents today are a mere historical footnote, a small glimpse into the grand jury proceedings," Mr Wood said in a statement. "It's four pages of what would have likely been hundreds of volumes of testimony and exhibit." The prosecutor at the time, Alex Hunter, has not commented about the newly released documents. Patsy Ramsey died of cancer in 2006. The investigation into JonBenet's death gained national attention in the US after grisly details of the crime and videos of the girl performing in beauty pageants were publicised. The Ramseys were never charged, and DNA evidence eventually suggested someone else killed the girl. In 2008, prosecutors formally exonerated them in the murder and publicly apologised. Her killing remains unsolved. The release on Friday of the grand jury indictments came after a lawsuit by the Boulder Daily Camera newspaper and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP). The 1999 documents show the grand jury moved to charge Mr and Mrs Ramsey with child abuse resulting in death and with being an accessory to a crime. The documents allege the couple placed their daughter "in a situation which posed a threat of injury to the child's life or health" which led to her death, and then helped the killer evade discovery and prosecution. Alex Hunter, the Boulder County district attorney at the time, declined to sign the indictments, effectively dropping the charges. "I and my prosecutorial team believe we do not have sufficient evidence to warrant the filing of charges against anyone who has been investigated at this time," Alex Hunter, the Boulder County district attorney, said in 1999. Analysts say it is uncommon for a district attorney not to sign off on a grand jury decision. US grand juries are convened in secret and tasked with determining whether enough evidence exists to bring a suspect to trial. But prosecutors must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict - a substantially higher bar. JonBenet's body was found in the basement of her home on 26 December 1996 after her parents reported her missing. Her skull was fractured and she had been strangled. The couple offered a $100,000 (£61,700) reward for information about the killer. The Boulder police were also faulted for botching the initial search of the Ramseys' home. In 2008, former District Attorney Mary Lacy publically apologised to the Ramseys after new DNA evidence suggested the killer was not a family member. </body>

      <body>Long before the Metro, the steam trains of Petite Ceinture ("Little Belt" in English) connected Paris's main railway stations carrying people around the city along the path of its ancient walls. The circular line went into gradual decline from the 1930s, when competition arrived in the form of the more modern underground Metro system. For 32km (almost 20 miles) the tracks of Petite Ceinture snake through bustling Paris, isolated and largely unseen from street level in deep trenches, long tunnels, and bridges. Nature has reclaimed the space and it has become a haven for wild flowers and animals. The line is officially off-limits to the public, but this hasn't stopped many people attempting to explore it. There is now a fierce debate in the French capital about what to do with the tracks and stations of the Petite Ceinture that still remain. A small section opened as a park in August 2013 and the mayoral elections offer competing plans for cycle routes and parks. Associations set up to preserve the space would prefer to see the line reopened for pedestrian services. BBC News joined Thomas Jorion - a photographer who has been documenting the line since 1996 - on a tour of what he calls the last great wasteland in Paris.

The rating means Iceland is the country where women enjoy the most equal access to education and healthcare. It is also where women are most likely to be able to participate fully in the country's political and economic life. Iceland is joined at the top of the The Global Gender Gap Report, 2013 by its Nordic neighbours Finland, Norway and Sweden. Overall, the gender gap narrowed slightly across the globe in 2013, as 86 of 133 countries showed improvements. However, "change is definitely slow", says one of the report's authors, Saadia Zahidi.

      <title>How do leaders cope with bugging?</title>
      <description>Why world leaders don't like using secure phones</description>

      <body>The most common reaction to news that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged by the US National Security Agency appears to be world-weary resignation. Followed by a sly suggestion that someone of her experience and stature should have known better. Kurt Volker, former US ambassador to Nato 2008-2009, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme "every country spies" and he could not believe that the revelations were a surprise to anyone. Lord West, a security minister under Gordon Brown, said he had "always worked on the assumption" that people were listening to his phone calls. "I know they jolly well were," he told Today. "I don't think it's surprising that people try and listen. If you are a head of state there are lots of people, not just other states, who are listening. "There are companies, all sorts of people, who want to hear what you are saying and I think you have to be extremely careful." A former senior British diplomat, who did not want to be named, told the BBC News website he always worked on the assumption that his phone calls were being listened to. This could sometimes be turned to the British delegation's advantage, he explained, by reinforcing the message that they were trying to get across in negotiations in supposedly private phone conversations, knowing full well that they would be intercepted. But at the same time, it was worth remembering when reading reports of what the representatives of other nations were saying that they were probably up to the same game, he added. Former Home Secretary David Blunkett recently revealed that Nicolas Sarkozy, the then French interior minister, tried to save time in negotiations over the closure of the Sangatte transit camp by saying he already knew the British position because the French secret service had intercepted unencrypted Home Office emails. But not everyone is quite so sanguine. Clare Short, who made headlines and provoked fury in Downing Street in 2004 when she revealed that the British secret service had bugged the office and telephone of then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, says she was genuinely "shocked" by the Merkel revelations. The former international development secretary also rejects the argument that Mrs Merkel's anger is for the benefit of the German public, many of whom are still haunted by the memory of the Stasi. "I am sure she was very angry and upset. These were her friends and now [she finds] they don't trust her," says Ms Short. Ms Short said she was regularly given intelligence reports about what Mr Annan was saying in the supposed privacy of his office but she became increasingly uncomfortable about this in the run-up to the Iraq war. She recalls the surreal and disturbing experience of chatting to Kofi Annan on her mobile phone and realising that someone would probably be listening in and transcribing every word. She says she can not recall any examples of being handed intelligence reports about what friendly powers were saying to each other on the phone during her time in office, from 1997 to 2003. But she says she was approached by "successive Cs" - the code name for the head of MI6 - offering to spy on the leaders of friendly nations in Africa. "I told them, 'No of course not. We don't want to spy on the people we are working with,'" she tells the BBC News website. She also explodes one popular myth about notorious technophobe Tony Blair - that he did not carry a mobile phone during his years in power. "I don't really believe that," she says, adding that it might be part of Downing Street myth-making: "It makes him more emperor-like." All heads of state, in the Western world at least, will have access to encrypted mobile phones and other secure lines. The problem, for security staff, is convincing world leaders to take the espionage threat seriously. Shortly after taking office in 2008, Barack Obama managed to convince the secret service to let him keep his own Blackberry, despite fears it would broadcast his location and make him vulnerable to hacking. Mr Obama is said to be frustrated about having to live in the White House "bubble", cut off from the outside world and unable to communicate with normal people. The President's Blackberry is often seen on his belt and he is sometimes pictured scrolling through his messages as he travels in his limousine. In France, senior officials have access to a secure intranet and phone network - but the country's leaders are reported to be reluctant to use the slow and restrictive system, which can take up to 30 seconds to place a call. President Francois Hollande is said to have followed predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy by holding on to his personal smartphone. Mobile phones are banned in No 10 - you have to hand them in at the door - over fears foreign powers are listening in. All calls in and out are routed through a secure switchboard staffed by officials - a system which continues when the prime minister is travelling. Downing Street is remaining tight-lipped about the latest bugging revelations. Asked earlier if the prime minister was still using his mobile phone, Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: "I haven't seen him use a different one". </body>

      <title>Corden on singing like Paul Potts</title>
      <description>James Corden on becoming Paul Potts</description>

      <body>James Corden talks about bringing Britain's Got Talent winner Paul Potts to the big screen, singing with Keira Knightley and his admiration for Meryl Streep. Corden admits he had his doubts about playing talent show contestant-turned-opera singer Potts in his new film One Chance. "I think my reaction was the same as everyone else's when they hear there's a Paul Potts film," laughs Corden. "I was like 'Really? Are you sure this is a good idea?" But after director David Frankel, of The Devil Wears Prada fame, convinced him the film would focus on the build-up to that famous audition - Potts' journey from a bullied, opera-obsessed young boy to a YouTube sensation - he was in. "It's a sports movie basically, where the sport is... opera," says Corden. Potts was a mobile-phone salesman when he entered and won the first series of reality show Britain's Got Talent in 2007, and the film uses footage of judges Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden and Piers Morgan's genuine reactions to that "watercooler moment". It also boasts British talent such as Julie Walters and Colm Meaney as Paul's parents, MacKenzie Crook as his friend (and manager in Carphone Warehouse) and Alexandra Roach as his love interest. Corden had to practise wearing his clip-in fake "Paul Potts teeth" for six weeks to conquer any lisping - Potts famously got his fixed with his BGT prize money - but they were "tremendously useful" for getting into character. Pulling off Potts' operatic singing voice proved a bit more challenging. "When I said yes to the film I was a little bit bullish and thought, 'I can do this'," reveals Corden. "So they got me some singing lessons with this brilliant teacher in New York. After about eight or nine lessons some producers came down to hear my opera. "I got about a third of the way through Nessun Dorma and they just went, 'Yeah we're going to get someone else to do this'. It wasn't great." So Corden sang "with the microphone turned off" during filming, "and then Paul sort of synched to my lips really". "We were all a little bit worried - will it work, will they buy it?" admits Corden. "Actually you kind of do." The film is backed by Hollywood heavyweight producer Harvey Weinstein, who Corden is said to have impressed while on stage in last year's hit play One Man, Two Guvnors. But he's quick to rubbish internet rumours that Weinstein will be running any sort of Oscar campaign for him. "For this?" he laughs. "I would be very surprised, I can't imagine that will be anywhere close to the case. "We've made a really nice, light, humorous film and I'm immensely proud of it, but I think you can start to get ever so slightly carried away with those sorts of things and I'm definitely not, in any way." It must be hard for Corden to keep his feet on the ground though, when he is currently turning up to work at Shepperton Studios with the likes of Johnny Depp and Meryl Streep. Nine director Rob Marshall has cast him in "a dream of a role", as The Baker in a big-budget film version of Broadway musical Into the Woods. "It's certainly the biggest thing I've ever done. It's ridiculous, I spent a long time just waiting to be fired really," says Corden. "I thought someone would go, 'This is silly, we should get someone who's actually famous'." But he's still in the job, along with Chris Pine, Anna Kendrick and Emily Blunt. However it is Streep who has really impressed him. "I would be a robot if it didn't affect me, I think she's probably the greatest actress alive," he says enthusiastically. "But (the reason) she's so incredible, is that she's just so unbelievably welcoming and encouraging and puts you at ease. (She is) a team player, she encourages a company spirit. I genuinely can't speak highly enough about her." Having misspent some of his youth in various, slightly dubious boybands, Corden can actually hold a tune. He'll be doing so in Into the Woods and alongside Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo in another film, Can a Song Save Your Life?, due out next year. "I play Keira's old friend from home who's a struggling musician in New York. I sing, but I'm not - there's a pattern emerging here - I sing but I'm not very good," he laughs. "Keira's really got the best songs in it - her voice is unbelievable, genuinely. People are going to be so shocked when they hear it. I think it's her best performance. "It's written and directed by John Carney who made the film Once, which I'm a huge fan of. I'm very proud to be in it," says Corden. In fact, these days Corden seems rightly proud of all his work. With flops like Lesbian Vampire Killers and his ill-fated sketch show Horne and Corden better left out of it, he currently has his fingers in many successful pies. New BBC Two comedy The Wrong Mans is a return to form for the Gavin and Stacey co-creator - currently enjoying positive viewing figures and favourable reviews. And co-written with Mathew Baynton, it gives him the chance to do what he likes best: "Being at the seed of an idea, and writing it and shooting it and editing it, seeing it through. That is probably where I'm probably most creatively fulfilled." There's also hosting Sky One sports quiz A League of Their Own, and another year of the Brit Awards in 2014 before he hands hosting duties over to "someone younger and better looking". His plans to return to the stage - "I think in 2015" - sound like they've been mapped out with precision, but Corden denies that is the case. "I've never really had a career plan, which I'm sure won't come as a shock to anyone," he says. "Mainly my plan is to have fun and enjoy it. I couldn't think of anything worse than not enjoying it really." </body>

      <description>Meeting the faces behind technology's most iconic voices</description>

      <body>Millions of people hear their voices every day - but would you recognise them if you saw them walking down the street? Well maybe now you will. The BBC met the faces behind four of the most famous and iconic voices heard in technology today. Siri, Apple's voice-powered personal assistant, made its debut in June 2010. Since then, millions of the devices with the feature have been sold worldwide. In the UK, the voice you will hear responding to commands belongs to Jon Briggs, an illustrious voiceover artist whose portfolio includes the likes of the Weakest Link, Radio 2 and Channel 4. Jon had offered up his voice to a firm that specialises in computer-generated speech - that is, taking Jon's voice but moulding it to say virtually any possible phrase. Apple, when creating Siri, picked out Jon - unbeknownst to him. "I discovered that I was being used as the voice of Siri when Rory Cellan-Jones, the BBC technology correspondent, suddenly started demonstrating it on BBC Breakfast. "I thought 'I recognise that voice!', and so it was true - and it's a slightly bizarre journey since then." It means that while his voice is now being played out countless times a day all over the country, Apple has not paid him - he only received the fee earned he when recording the original material. But, he says he's excited to be "in early" on what he believes is changing how we use technology. "You can take a photograph of your desk - there is a screen a keyboard and a mouse. "You will show it to your children or your grandchildren and they will laugh and go 'you had a thing called a mouse? What's that funny thing with letters on?'" In contrast to the received pronunciation of her "Tube" voice, Emma Clarke's speaking voice is in fact Northern - growing up, as she did, in Sale near Manchester. Her voice can be heard across the Bakerloo, Central and District lines of London's iconic Underground network. The process of getting the job was long and painstaking - months of focus groups and whittling down possible candidates. During the selection, each possible voice was given a codename. Emma's, apparently, was 'Marilyn'. "Had they named me 'Brenda' I'm not sure I'd have got the gig," she jokes. She now gets fan mail from all over the world, particularly from Texas. "People initially thought I was actually on the train!" she says, "Or in some kind of central control room. I don't know where they thought it was." She says she is proud to lend her voice to the network, but adds that she hopes some of the lines she recorded never have to be heard by the public. "There were a couple of emergency announcements, that I remember when I read them on the script I thought 'oh god, imagine how these people will feel when they hear these announcements. "I felt such a sense of responsibility, of calming people down." Unlike the other voices in this piece, Terry Green is the only one who doesn't consider his voice to be his profession. He found his way to audio fame indirectly. He specialises in customer service, and the systems used in shops to get things moving and punters through the tills. And so it was, when the company he was working for needed a male voice to beckon people to the till, he stepped forward: "Cashier number three, please..." "We just sat down with a digital voice recorder, laid down the track, and that was it! I was on the prototype system, and then suddenly rolled out to 8,000 shops." They recorded up to cashier number 25 - but now the system goes much further. Indeed, around the world, the company's technology is used in thousands of stores - although with local voices instead of Terry's. Now he makes his living as a leading expert on the study of shoppers' behaviour. "My voice was on all these systems that we were rolling out, so I was becoming more and better known. I started writing white papers, and eventually I came to write a book." One morning, Sara Mendes da Costa was listening to Terry Wogan on Radio 2 when he mentioned that a competition would be held to find the new voice of the Speaking Clock. "A little bell rang in my head and I went 'oooh!'" She wasn't alone - within moments she had had calls friends and family saying she should put herself forward. She won, and from 2007 she took over the voice of the Speaking Clock, which is called up approximately 60 million times each year. It was a job she was excited, but nervous, to take on. "Brian Cobby, who sadly passed away last year, had the most beautiful, rich, Shakespearian voice. "Then I came along - I have visions of people going 'oh...'!" "But they wanted something different, someone a bit more of the moment, a little bit more who we are now." Sara uses the Speaking Clock regularly in her day-to-day work, and admits she just can't resist listening to each and every word. "I listen until when it goes through to 'precisely' - and only then I can hang up! "It's just a weird thing that I've got." Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <body>A new mobile phone concept that would give users a chance to choose from a range of components, and replace or upgrade them when necessary, has generated enormous interest online. But could this sustainable, modular device ever become a reality? Six months ago, the Dutch designer Dave Hakkens took apart his favourite camera. "I noticed all these little parts," he says. "And everything was good except for the lens motor. That had broken." But when Hakkens contacted the manufacturer to get a replacement motor, he was advised to just replace the whole camera. "With your bike you repair the tyre, you don't throw the bike away," he says. "But for some reason this is what we do with electronics." Hakkens realised that if a device could be taken apart and upgraded more easily it would last much longer, minimising electrical waste. And so the idea of Phonebloks was born. The concept - Hakkens hasn't figured out how to actually make it - is for a phone with a replaceable screen and easily moveable, changeable "bloks", each containing a different element such as battery, chipset, gyroscope and so on. In the video Hakkens made to publicise Phonebloks, the bits fall into place on the backplate of the phone like pieces of Lego. The bloks vary in size and can be made to tessellate in any number of combinations. "Let's say this is your phone and you do everything in the cloud - why not replace your storage blok with a bigger battery blok?" asks the voiceover. "If you're like this guy and love to take pictures, why not upgrade your camera?" Last month, Hakkens set about showing off Phonebloks using the "crowd speaking" platform Thunderclap. Users donate their social reach to a project they support, allowing the site to commandeer their Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook accounts to broadcast a message at a single, predetermined moment. Hakkens was aiming for 500 people to sign up to his Thunderclap, but the Phonebloks video went viral, gaining seven million views in three days. He has now amassed 950,000 Thunderclap supporters and on Tuesday the Phonebloks video will ping across social networks 375 million times. "It comes down to a consumer signal," says Kyle Wiens, the founder of iFixit.com, a repository for user-generated repair manuals to the latest gadgets. "The market needs to indicate to manufacturers that we care about modular, repairable hardware." Phones have never been as modular as computers, but Wiens says they used to be sturdier and more repairable. Take batteries. Until the iPhone came along in 2007, batteries on all handsets could be readily removed. With every new phone the power source is a little bit harder to get to, stuck down with more glue, or tucked away in a case that's more impregnable. To get the battery out of the HTC One, the geeks at iFixit had to mangle the phone's casing and remove the motherboard. "I wish batteries were more replaceable than they are," says Bruce Harvey, an electrical engineer at Florida State University. "The reason they're not is in order to make the phone so small, the battery's shape is conformed to fit in there, rather than be a square block [like Phonebloks]." It is consumer preference for a small phone that has pushed manufacturers to hide their batteries away. In the same way, our craving for ever-slimmer, speedier phones has led them to pile hardware - such as the central processor, memory and wifi - on to the same chip, not separate them out into blocks. Harvey believes that Phonebloks is a technical challenge but an achievable one. The bloks could talk to one another if they were all designed to work with the same signalling system. However, he says the real difficulty would be in making a modular phone robust enough to survive the "harsh environment" of the trouser pocket. Each component would have to be encased in a material such as plastic, adding thickness and making the device less sexy. "It's one of those things where if people look at it they say, 'Wow, I can be more ecologically sound, I get upgrades when I want to…'" he says. "Then someone shows them that their phone's going to be six-tenths of an inch (1.5cm) thick or something like that. Reality will meet up with hopes and dreams." The challenge of marketing a modular system doesn't end with the chubbiness problem. "We sadly live in a disposable society and people do have an expectation that they will change their phone every so often," says Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight (and proud owner of more than 800 handsets going back two decades). How long people hang on to a handset varies across the world. On average it's just over three years, but in the US it's just 20 months. Although new devices are almost always bought on a contract, people have come to regard their new phone as a "free upgrade". Lots of us wait impatiently for upgrade day - phone technology is advancing so fast that multiple components, though still functional, feel outdated after a couple of years. However, this trend may not continue indefinitely, Wood says. Mobile phones could be approaching an "innovation plateau" where the basics like speed and screen resolution are as good as they can get. Add to this the regular software "drops" that make our phones feel like new, and people might start hanging on to their handsets for longer. In this kind of market, Phonebloks might become viable, Wood argues. Home computers reached an innovation plateau some years ago, but while we replace our computers less frequently than we used to, not many of us exploit the modular nature of our PCs and upgrade the modules. However, in Hakkens's view that's because it isn't easy enough - only "die-hard geeks" are willing to reach for a screwdriver to unscrew their memory or motherboard. Price is arguably the least important factor in the mobile phone market, but it may represent another challenge for Phonebloks. In the long run, you might think consumers would save money with a modular system that can be continually upgraded and never needs chucking out, but this may not be the case. Big phone companies achieve enormous efficiencies of scale by negotiating special rates with parts manufacturers, buying up production capacity for months at a time. In return, the parts manufacturers get investment for research and development and a guarantee of future business. The idea of marketing "bloks" to end-consumers through a "blokstore" might not be so appealing to these companies, which might in turn prevent similar economies of scale being achieved. Hakkens recognises that neither the big phone companies nor the manufacturers that work with them are likely to jump at his idea - he sees it as a chance for other electronics companies to enter the fray. He says he has been approached by a number of companies and individuals excited about getting involved. "Right now, I'm thinking about what would be the best next step," he says. "Would it be to build it myself, open-source, online - or partner up with companies and collaborators?" He seems to have been caught off guard by the attention his little idea is receiving. "I wasn't planning to do a next step," he admits, "but now I have all these people offering help." Kyle Wiens and Ben Wood are enthusiastic about Phonebloks, but they both believe the concept might end in a half-way house - a phone in which the battery and screen, and possibly the memory and camera, can be easily replaced. For Wiens, the key to making a green phone is different - a design durable enough for the device to reach a second-hand market. "The whole phone doesn't need to be modular so long as it can be repaired and kept in service," he says. Dave Hakkens doesn't pretend to have all the answers, or even certainty that Phonebloks will see the light of day. "Half of the world says it's possible, the other half says it's not possible," he says. "I don't think anyone really knows because no-one's really tried it. So that's the next thing to do - just figure it out." Dave Hakkens spoke to Click on the BBC World Service - listen again to the programme on iPlayer or get the Click podcast.

      <body>There's been a wave of popularity for drinks like the Aperol spritz, the Negroni, and a host of cocktails flavoured with "bitters". Why are people turning their backs on sweet cocktails in favour of a bitter taste? The last two decades have seen an extraordinary resurgence in cocktail-making on both sides of the Atlantic, with everything from Cointreau-sweetened Cosmopolitans to sugary Mojitos being drunk in vast quantities. But there is now a definite trend towards bitter drinks. People are ordering whisky or gin-based drinks paired with vermouths. And there is growing interest in the US, UK and other European nations in Italian amari. These complex, herbal, bittersweet drinks, with names like Averna, Ramazzotti, Montenegro and Fernet Branca, are usually consumed as aperitivi or digestivi - drinks thought to either encourage the appetite before dinner or help with digestion afterwards. Their bitter mixer cousins, Cynar, Campari and Aperol, are increasingly being used in cocktails. Aperol - based on bitter orange and rhubarb and containing classic bitter ingredients like gentian and cinchona (a source of quinine) - has rocketed in popularity in recent years following a push by owner Gruppo Campari. Sales rose 156% in the UK in 2012 and 56% in the US. This year's figures, announced soon, are expected to be even bigger. A poster campaign in the UK encourages people to try an Aperol spritz - prosecco sparkling wine and soda water mixed with Aperol. A fundamental point of the spritz is its low alcohol content. Aperol's slogan is "poco alcolico", roughly meaning a little bit alcoholic. "I think the Aperol spritz was probably the most asked-for drink in the outdoor areas of most decent bars in London this summer," says World Duty Free mixologist Charlie McCarthy. Laura Tallo, from Nonna's Italian Cucina in Bath, says many British drinkers have returned after holidays in Italy, having seen certain drinks paired with tavola calda - the selection of hot, freshly-baked food. "People are definitely beginning to embrace the Italian custom of drinking aperitifs. We have seen a definite trend emerging of people choosing classic Italian pre-dinner drinks such as an Aperol spritz, Negroni [equal parts Campari, gin and sweet vermouth], Americano or Martini," she says. Such drinks are not to everyone's taste, of course. While many Italians have been brought up around the tradition of amari, they can baffle non-Italian palates at first taste. "They say of a Negroni the first two or three sips you despise, and after you have had two or three drinks you start to like it," says Tom Ross, bars manager of the Polpo restaurant group in London. The taste of Fernet Branca - vaguely minty but with pungent undertones of cough medicine - is so powerful that comedian Bill Cosby constructed a seven-minute anecdote around his initial horror on encountering the drink in Italy. And yet Fernet is loved by many, being drunk with cola in Argentina and - accompanied by a separate shot of ginger beer - known as the "bartender's handshake" in San Francisco. One of the first recorded definitions of a cocktail was in a New York journal in 1803, which classified it as a mixture of any "spirituous liquor", with water, sugar and "bitters", known at the time as a bittered sling. You can find the descendant of these traditional bitters (with the term typically referring to both singular and plural) in any decent bar in the UK or US. There'll be a rather unusual bottle among the others - small with a yellow top and an oversized label covered in small print. It is the world's most famous cocktail bitters, Angostura. This bitters is the key ingredient in pink gin, the traditional officers' cocktail in the Royal Navy. It's also the bedrock of famous cocktails, including the Old Fashioned, beloved of Mad Men's Don Draper, and the Manhattan. A supply shortage in 2009 caused panic throughout the world's bartending community, according to McCarthy, and prompted bartenders to start making their own. The current wave of speakeasy-type bars inspired by the prohibition years in the US, has prompted interest in traditional and hitherto forgotten cocktails. This in turn has prompted demand for more unusual bitters. Bob Petrie, of Bob's Bitters, started in 2005 when he was approached by the Dorchester Hotel to create a range. Traditional bitters are very complex, with aromatic flavours brought out from a combination of barks, roots, herbs, and spices by macerating them in alcohol. He looked at pairing them with the "botanicals" in gin, and came up with a range including cardamom, chocolate, coriander, ginger, grapefruit, lavender, liquorice, orange and mandarin, peppermint and vanilla. "Single flavours are a lot easier for the barman as it gives a lot more scope," Petrie says. "What they can do with mine is mix and match." Rochdale-born US celebrity mixologist Gary Regan is another who was prompted to make his own to replicate the orange bitters in some old cocktail recipes. "When I realised it was hard to get good ones I decided to make my own. I stole a recipe from the Gentleman's Companion of 1939. I had about four different trials and eventually got something I liked. "This shift towards bitter has been going on for eight years," Regan estimates. "[But] most bitters aren't that bitter. They taste herbal. In fact, they are a bit on the sweet side sometimes." Fee Brothers in Rochester, New York, has been making bitters since 1863, with a short break for prohibition. Joe and Ellen Fee are the fourth generation. Their 92-year-old father still regularly visits the plant. Joe Fee says there has been a marked increase in sales over the past seven years. "Just about anything can be made into a bitters. They are your spice rack behind the bar." "I am the Willy Wonka of the cocktail mixers," boasts Ellen Fee, who conjures up the new flavours. "I like to think in terms of what flavour is already bitter. Cocoa powder is bitter, cranberry is bitter. You add to that and make it more interesting." The plethora of these cocktail tinctures and potions shows the tastes of aficionados have shifted. But there are other flagbearers for a more bitter palate. Many James Bond fans attempt to recreate the Vesper Martini from Casino Royale. Bond asks for it to be made with strong gin, vodka and the bitter Kina Lillet. Lillet took out much of the bitter quinine in the 1980s and fans tend to use Cocchi Americano Italian vermouth instead. And the Queen has followed in her mother's footsteps by drinking gin and Dubonnet - the quinine-bittered French aperitif. Just a few years ago, her choice was seen as unusual. Now she's part of an established trend. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <description>What is the point of government consultations?</description>

      <body>What is the point of government consultations? I pose the question at the end of a week in which ministers responded to three official consultations on three controversial proposals - and appeared to ignore the results from them all. On Monday, the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) published its response to a consultation on planned changes to the assessment of people with disabilities in determining their entitlement to benefits. The government had conducted the consultation, it said, "in a fully open-minded manner". Ministers had carefully considered all the views expressed. The consultation focused on plans limiting entitlement to extra help for mobility needs to those who cannot walk 20m. The overwhelming response was that this was a bad idea. "Respondents felt there was no evidence to support the use of 20m," the consultation reported, pointing out "that other government policies use 50m as a measure of mobility". In a section entitled "What you told us", the DWP notes concern that the plan "could increase isolation and reduce independence, have significant financial impact, and cause deterioration in their physical and mental health". Respondents warned that the 20m criteria would mean some disabled people needing support from other public services, increasing the cost for the government. "The most common suggestion made by respondents", the DWP reports, "was to extend the qualifying distance for the enhanced rate from 20m to a longer distance". Nowhere in the government's response to the consultation is there evidence that anyone thought the 20m criteria was the right policy. "Having considered all these factors", the DWP response concludes, "the government believes that the use of 20m is the best way of identifying those whose physical mobility is most limited". It is, of course, the democratic right of ministers to consult and to listen and then ignore. The arguments put forward by the DWP may be compelling. But it does lead some to ask whether the consultation really had much value. A similar question might be posed following the government's response on Tuesday to consultations on two proposals concerning immigrants. The Home Office published the results of the public consultation on plans for a levy on temporary non-EEA migrants as a contribution towards the costs of possible NHS care while in the UK. It is a move that ministers claim enjoys considerable public support, but the consultation came back with a rather different view. On the principle of a levy, "34% felt that temporary migrants should make a direct contribution to the costs of their healthcare. Sixty-two per cent disagreed," it found. The Home Office notes differences depending upon the "type of respondent". Among the general public, 65% were against the plan. Among organisations that responded, 77% were opposed. Health-sector respondents, however, were in favour - 66% felt temporary migrants should contribute to the cost of their healthcare. It is the view of 235 health sector respondents, representing around 12% of the total, that appears to have swayed ministers most. "We have considered all responses to these questions carefully but remain convinced that only permanent migrants should be automatically eligible for free NHS care." Consultations are not referendums. In a way, it seems odd the Home Office should go to such trouble to quantify the proportions for and against the policy since the exercise is not designed as an X-factor style public vote. But having conducted a public consultation and expressing gratitude to all those "who have taken the time to respond and to those who have contributed their experience and insight to what is a complex issue", one is left wondering what the point was. The government response to a separate consultation, also published on Tuesday, invites the same question. This time the proposal under scrutiny was the introduction of a legal obligation on landlords to check the immigration status of tenants. "While between one-third and two-fifths of respondents supported the proposal," the Home Office response states, "slightly more than half of all respondents disagreed." The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors considered it "inappropriate to use private landlords and lettings agents to help deliver the government's immigration policy". The majority of landlord representative organisations were opposed. "The most widely expressed concern by third sector organisations," the Home Office reveals, "was the potential to impact on vulnerable people, such as those who were homeless, those with learning difficulties and those fleeing domestic abuse". The response? "The government has carefully considered the responses to the consultation and remains convinced of an urgent need for action to deter illegal migration and to safeguard the legitimate housing market." The consultation may lead to ministers including an amendment designed to counter discrimination against foreign national tenants. But on the broad proposal, it seems the exercise has not shifted government thinking one jot. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), "public consultation is one of the key regulatory tools employed to improve transparency, efficiency and effectiveness of regulation". But there has long been scepticism as to whether such exercises are anything more than cosmetic. The public consultation is an opportunity for ministers to test their ideas with experts, those directly affected and voters more generally. Community participation on proposed legislation is seen as a key component of "citizen power". But formal public consultation exercises very rarely result in a government re-think - even if they reveal profound concern. That is not the point of them, and we should not pretend otherwise. </body>

      <title>Sifting through the data mountain</title>
      <description>What is the use of performance figures to patients?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24651405</url>
      <date>1382661465</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70694000/jpg/_70694637_files.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>The Care Quality Commission has gathered together a mountain of data. A total of 161 hospital trusts have been assessed against 150 measures from mortality and infection rates to errors and patient survey results. Even taking into account the fact that not all the data was applicable to every trust there is still well over 12,000 bits of data to wade through. So how can patients navigate their way around it? The first thing to say is that this is not a final judgement on hospital trusts. That will come over the next two years as the inspection programme is rolled out. Instead, the CQC has referred to it as a screening tool rather than diagnosis - it is to be used to prioritise which trust to visit first. But that does not mean it cannot and should not be used by patients. What the regulator has done is pull together all the key bits of information already available on performance and provided an analysis of which hospital trusts are furthest outside the expected range. Until the inspection process is complete, it is perhaps the most comprehensive and informative assessment of what is happening in the NHS at the moment. But it does not mean the exercise is fool-proof. That much is clear already. For example, four of the trusts put into special measures earlier this year because of serious concerns about standards did not make it into the highest risk band one category. In fact two (Burton Hospitals and George Eliot) ended up in band three. Although all were subsequently bumped up to band one because of the issues already identified. When the final ratings are produced it is likely some of those judged low risk will get a bad rating, while some of the high risk ones will be given a good or outstanding rating. One of the reasons for this may be related to the fact the different measures have not been weighted for seriousness. For example a trust with a high sickness rate or poor uptake of vaccination among its staff would get the same risk rating as another with a high mortality rate. In some ways, that is understandable. For example, a trust with high absence rates is likely to have a problem with morale and management. That is not good for patients. The problem is that we just do not know yet whether it is an accurate way of risk profiling. The regulator has promised to fine-tune its system as it goes along. Of the first 18 trusts to be inspected, there is an even spread between the top two bands, the middle two and the bottom two. That will give it an early indication of the accuracy of its methods. In the meantime, patients can pour through the individual reports that have been produced for each trust here. There is a summary page of the risks identified, setting out the areas for which the trust has a poor record. It will be up to patients to decide what to do with the information and whether they want to exercise choice where they can. But as one person who is heavily involved in analysing data for the NHS put it to me: "If you can avoid it, why would you go to a hospital where there is much more evidence of risk than another?" </body>

      <title>US spying 'may harm terror fight'</title>
      <description>EU leaders meeting in Brussels say distrust of the US over spying could harm intelligence-gathering in the fight against terrorism.</description>

      <body>EU leaders meeting in Brussels said distrust of the US over spying could harm the fight against terrorism. A statement agreed by the leaders said that "a lack of trust could prejudice" intelligence-gathering co-operation. German spy chiefs are travelling to Washington next week to press for action over the alleged monitoring of Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone. Both Germany and France want talks with the US to find a new "understanding" by the end of the year. As well as the bugging of Mrs Merkel's phone, there are claims the US National Security Agency (NSA) has monitored millions of telephone calls by both German and French citizens. Spain on Friday followed Germany and France in summoning the US ambassador to explain reports of spying on the country. The UK's Guardian newspaper has reported that it obtained a confidential memo from the NSA suggesting it had monitored the phones of 35 world leaders. The latest revelations have been sourced to US whistleblower Edward Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who fled the country earlier this year and is now in Russia. US state department spokesperson Jen Psaki said a review of US intelligence gathering, called for by President Obama, would look at how it affects foreign policy. The "high level group of outside experts... will consider as part of this how we can maintain the public's trust, how the surveillance impacts our foreign policy, particularly in an age when more and more information is becoming public," she said. The EU leaders' statement, released earlier on Friday, reflected their conclusions following talks on Thursday. It said the recent intelligence issues had raised "deep concerns" among European citizens. The statement said the leaders "underlined the close relationship between Europe and the USA and the value of that partnership". "[The leaders] stressed that intelligence-gathering is a vital element in the fight against terrorism," it continued. And it went on: "A lack of trust could prejudice the necessary cooperation in the field of intelligence-gathering." "The heads of state or government took note of the intention of France and Germany to seek bilateral talks with the USA with the aim of finding before the end of the year an understanding on mutual relations in that field," the leaders' statement also said. "They noted that other EU countries are welcome to join this initiative." French President Francois Hollande said the aim of the initiative "is about knowing about the past and setting a framework for the future and putting an end to monitoring mechanisms that are not controlled". Germany and France said they are proposing talks with the US to settle the row by the end of the year. But Mrs Merkel stressed Berlin and Paris would be making their own separate approaches to Washington. BBC Europe editor Gavin Hewitt says the French and Germans are looking for a new set of rules with a "no spying pact" at the core. He says this would mirror an arrangement the United States has had with Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada since just after World War II. That secret intelligence-sharing operation is known as Five Eyes. Mrs Merkel said she did not know the exact details of the Five Eyes arrangement so could not say whether that is exactly what Germany is seeking, but added: "We need something clear-cut, in line with the spirit of an alliance". UK Prime Minister David Cameron acknowledged the UK's "unique partnership" with the US regarding security but said: "I understand what others want to do and support that, as I think does President Obama". When asked by the BBC if the US had ever monitored Mr Cameron's phone, White House National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said: "His communications have not, are not and will not be monitored by the US." 'Look to the future' The spying revelations have overshadowed other issues at the EU summit in Brussels, including the Mediterranean migration problem, which framed the agenda of Friday's talks. Italian authorities said they had intercepted some 800 migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean as the EU leaders prepared to meet. A number leaders indicated their support for the French and German position. Belgian Prime Minister Elio di Rupo said: "The objective must remain the same - to fight against terrorism but also respect privacy. "Everyone can understand the need for exceptional measures given the danger of terrorism... but we are not in the position where we should spy on each other." Swedish PM Fredrik Reinfeldt said it was "completely unacceptable" to eavesdrop on the leader of an ally, a view echoed by Italian PM Enrico Letta, who added: "We want the truth." Other leaders signalled the need to move on. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said: "The main thing is that we look to the future. The trans-Atlantic partnership was, and is, important." Mrs Merkel had raised her concerns with US President Barack Obama in a call on Wednesday. White House spokesman Jay Carney later said Mr Obama had assured Mrs Merkel that her phone was not being listened to now and would not be in the future. However, his statement left open the question of whether calls had been listened to in the past. </body>

      <title>Militants raid north Nigerian city</title>
      <description>Militants engage security forces in a long gun battle in a key city in northern Nigeria, while the army says it has killed 74 militants elsewhere.</description>

      <body>Suspected Boko Haram militants have engaged security forces in a lengthy gun battle and raided a hospital in the northern Nigerian city of Damaturu. Residents told the BBC that it was a "big, audacious attack" and that assailants stole drugs from the hospital and drove off in ambulances. Meanwhile, the military said it had killed 74 suspected Boko Haram militants in a raid in Borno state. Authorities have recently stepped up their campaign against the militants. North-eastern Nigeria is the focus of an insurgency by the group that began in 2009 and aims to create an Islamic state. President Goodluck Jonathan urged the military to up its campaign against Boko Haram five months ago. Damaturu is the main city in Yobe state, which lies to the west of Borno. It has been calm for more than a year, and there is a large military presence in there. Nonetheless, gunfire rocked the city for some seven hours after a group of about 20 gunmen - some in military uniform - targeted the hospital late on Thursday. Clashes between militants and the security forces spread to other parts of the city. A health worker described seeing a police vehicle ferrying corpses to the mortuary. The resident who described the attack as "audacious" said the gunfire was heavy, continuous, and loud. He also said that people in Damaturu were surprised that it had taken the military at least an hour to respond. Authorities later imposed a 24-hour curfew, and streets were deserted on Friday. The military raid in Borno state involved "ground and aerial assault" and "led to the destruction of the identified terrorist camps," said army spokesman Lt Mohammed Dole. Lt Dole said the latest raid had been carried out on Thursday and that two soldiers had been wounded. The BBC's Will Ross reports from Nigeria that it seems surprising that Boko Haram camps are still being found, given all the resources available to the army. The army's claims about military operations against the group are hard to verify - there has been no mobile phone network in Borno state since the latest offensive was launched. Nigeria's campaign has been criticised by human rights groups. Amnesty International said earlier this month that hundreds had died in detention in north-eastern Nigeria, some from starvation or extra-judicial killings. Nigeria's interior said the report was "not true". </body>

      <title>DNA test proves mystery girl parents</title>
      <description>DNA tests confirm a Bulgarian Roma woman as the mother of mystery child Maria, found in Greece last week.</description>

      <body>DNA tests have confirmed a Bulgarian Roma couple as the biological parents of mystery child Maria, found in Greece last week, Bulgarian officials say. They identified the couple as Sasha Ruseva and Atanas Rusev. The officials are investigating whether the mother had sold the child - a claim she has denied. Maria was found at a Roma camp in central Greece. Police noticed the lack of resemblance between the blonde girl and the adults she was staying with. The couple, Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulou, have since been charged with child abduction. They have insisted the girl was given to them legitimately. Maria - who was found near Farsala, central Greece - is currently being cared for by the Athens-based charity The Smile of the Child. There have been thousands of inquiries following an appeal to identify her. The case has also sparked concern over prejudice and racism towards Roma people. The child's parents - Sasha Ruseva and Atanas Rusev - and their eight children, had been filmed earlier by Bulgarian television at their home in the Roma district of the central town of Nikolaevo. Ms Ruseva, holding a child with red hair, told reporters that she and her husband had been working in the Greek city of Larisa four years ago when she gave birth to a girl. The girl was seven months old when they had to return to Bulgaria, and she said she could not afford to take the child with her. She said she was talking to a woman she worked with who told her: "Give me this child, I will take care of it. You can come and take it back any time you want. "But I had other children to take care of and I couldn't go... I have never got any money for it." Bulgarian officials said that during questioning, Ms Ruseva said she had recognised Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulou as the people she had left her child with. Prosecutors have pressed preliminary charges against Ms Ruseva for "deliberately selling a child while residing out of the country". In Greece, a lawyer representing the couple in the Roma camp near Farsala said on Friday they planned to seek legal custody of Maria. "Provided what we said is borne out, that it was not an abduction, then logically they will be released from prison and they will be able to enter a proper [adoption] process," Costas Katsavos was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency. "They truly and ardently want her back," he added. Maria's biological parents in Bulgaria also say they want to be re-united with her. However, the head of Bulgaria's social services department, Lidia Hristova, told Reuters: "After an investigation, we will decide what would be best for the child, whether to take her from the family, to offer social service, or so on." There will now be difficult questions for police both in Greece and Bulgaria, the BBC's Mark Lowen in Athens reports. He adds that clearly there will still be a legal case against the Greek couple, and possibly against Maria's parents as well. But Greek police could be left red-faced for making the initial allegations of abduction, our correspondent adds. Greek news site zougla.gr has published what it says is Ms Ruseva's identity card and a birth certificate for Maria from a hospital in Lamia, not far from Farsala and Larisa. The birth certificate says the girl was born in January 2009. Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulou have told police Maria was four years old, but the Smile of the Child charity say medical examinations suggest she is more like five or six. </body>

      <body>The FBI has issued wanted posters for a man they say is behind an eBay car scam that has netted $3m (£1.8m). Authorities in the US also want to track down six other fugitives in relation to the charges. The gang were described as "masters of illusion" who convinced people to pay for cars that did not exist. "They thought their distance would insulate them from law enforcement scrutiny. They were wrong," said US attorney Loretta Lynch. The FBI put out a wanted poster for 33-year-old Romanian Nicolae Popescu, charging him with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. "They siphoned funds from victims to fuel their greedy desires and created false identities, fake websites and counterfeit certificates of title in order to make the scheme more convincing," said FBI Assistant Director, George Venizelos. "Popescu and his co-conspirators were masters of illusion, but they can't escape their ultimate reality. "With the help of our law enforcement partners at home and abroad, we will bring them to justice." In a statement, eBay said: "We have partnered with law enforcement to alert consumers about the type of scams described in the indictment - which involve exploiting well-known, trusted brand names like eBay to attract consumers and then lure them onto fake websites and into fraudulent transactions. "Auto shoppers can be confident in their purchase by ensuring they start and complete their transactions on eBay Motors and never use money wire services to send payments." In a recorded conversation, the FBI said Mr Popescu boasted that he was "beyond the reach" of US authorities. As well as eBay, the gang is said to have used Cars.com, AutoTrader.com, and CycleTrader.com to sell the non-existent cars, usually priced between $10,000 (£6,150) and $40,000 (£24,700). "After the 'sellers' reached an agreement with the victim buyers, they would often email them invoices purporting to be from Amazon Payments, PayPal, or other online payment services, with instructions to transfer the money to the US bank accounts used by the defendants," an FBI statement explained. Romania has gained increasing notoriety as a hub for cybercrime. A report from technology magazine Wired detailed a town dubbed "Hackerville" by locals - where cybercriminals are said to learn their craft at an early age. </body>

      <body>North Korea has returned six South Korean men to their homeland, South Korean officials say, in a rare move. The men, between the ages of 27 and 67, were handed over on Friday at the truce village of Panmunjom, on the border between the two countries. Their names were not released and details surrounding their detention in the North remain unclear. The two Koreas remain technically at war, as the 1950-53 conflict ended in an armistice and not a peace treaty. Pyongyang's Red Cross informed Seoul that the men would be handed back via Panmunjom on Thursday, a statement from South Korea's Unification Ministry said. Officials said the group would be taken to South Korea's spy agency to face questions over their presence in North Korea. The South Korean government said that at first glance, the men were not on the list of those abducted by the North. One possibility is that they may have crossed into North Korea illegally from China, the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul says. Unofficial travel to North Korea by private citizens from South Korea is illegal, Pyongyang's state news agency announced the detention of several unnamed South Korean nationals in 2010 and there is speculation that they may be among those returned, our correspondent adds. The move by North Korea is seen as a gesture of reconciliation following the cancellation of reunions for families split by the division of the Korean peninsula at the end of the Korean War which were planned for last month. Tensions between the two Koreas rose earlier this year, after North Korea's third nuclear test in February. </body>

      <body>A small tsunami triggered by a quake has hit Japan's eastern coast - where the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant is located - but no damage is reported. The 30cm (1ft) waves reached the region after the 7.1 magnitude tremor struck at a depth of 10km (six miles), about 320km off the coast. A tsunami alert issued for several areas was later lifted. Workers at the Fukushima power station had been told to leave waterfront areas for higher ground. But a Fukushima spokesman later said there was no damage or change in readings at radiation monitoring posts around the plant, according to Reuters news agency. The Japan Meteorological Agency had warned that a small tsunami - up to one metre (3.3ft) - could reach the eastern coast after the tremor in the Pacific Ocean. The agency had also issued a "yellow" advisory for Fukushima and the prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi, Ibaraki and parts of Chiba. But it added: "Though there may be slight sea-level change in coastal regions, no tsunami damage is expected." The earthquake struck at about 02:10 local time on Saturday (17:10 GMT Friday). The tsunami advisory was lifted about two hours later. The Fukushima reactors were damaged by the earthquake and tsunami of March 2011. Since then, most of Japan's nuclear reactors have remained off, amid impassioned debate over nuclear energy. More than 18,000 people were left dead or missing in that disaster. </body>

      <description>At least 20 have been killed and many others injured in a car bomb blast outside a mosque in Syria's Damascus province, activists say.</description>

      <body>At least 20 people including children have been reported killed in a car bomb blast in Syria, outside a mosque in a town in Damascus province. The blast, in the town of Suq Wadi Barada, came just before the end of Friday prayers and brought down the mosque's entrances. It was not clear who had carried out the attack. Meanwhile, Norway has turned down a request to help the UN dismantle Syria's chemical weapons arsenal. The UN has set a deadline of mid-2014 for the weapons to be destroyed. Sweden has offered to provide an air force unit to transport the weapons. But Norway, asked by the US to help destroy the arms, said it was "not the most suitable location" for the work. At least three children were among the dead and dozens more wounded in Friday's car bombing, UK-based activist group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. While Suq Wadi Barada was under opposition control, government forces were positioned just outside the town, it said. State news agency Sana said one of the victims was aged seven. It blamed opposition forces, saying the bomb exploded while it was being assembled. Rebel leaders blamed government troops. Car bombs have become a common, deadly occurrence in the long-running conflict. Earlier this week, a truck bomb in the central city of Hama killed at least 30 and wounded dozens more. Observatory figures show the 31-month conflict has killed more than 115,000 people. More than five million people are displaced inside Syria, and another two million have fled the country as refugees, according to the UNHCR. In other developments on Friday, government troops appeared to have ambushed a rebel position near the capital, part of an offensive on rebel-held areas around Damascus. State media said 40 rebels had died, while activists reported 20 deaths. The area is part of Eastern Ghouta region, scene of August's poison gas attack which killed hundreds of civilians and prompted a UN Security Council resolution calling for the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal. Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) issued a warning Friday that continuous heavy bombing had forced 130,000 people out of al-Safira in the north. They said aid agencies could not cope with the numbers as winter approaches. "These people arrive in areas that already host a large number of displaced people, where the rare humanitarian players that are present are faced with huge needs," Marie-Noelle Rodrigue, MSF head of operations said in a statement. Fighting has also spread to northern Lebanon. The northern city of Tripoli has seen five days of street battles between supporters and opponents of the Syrian regime, killing five and injuring more than 40. </body>

      <body>An elderly Australian couple were unwittingly used as drug mules in a ruse involving a free trip to Canada, Australian police have revealed. The couple, from Perth, were told they had won a week-long trip, with flights, hotel and new luggage included. But when they landed back in Perth, they told customs officials they feared something was wrong with their luggage. Officials subsequently found 3.5kg (8 pounds) of methamphetamine in the lining of each bag. The incident happened on 13 October. A 38-year-old man was arrested later that day at Perth airport and has since been charged with drug-related offences. Local reports put the value of the drugs at A$7m ($6.7m, £4.1m) and said police believed the suitcases were swapped while the couple, aged 72 and 64, were in Canada. In a statement, police said the subsequent investigation had revealed "a complex and highly-organised scam in which older Australians appear to be targeted by a bogus Canadian-based tour company identifying itself as 'AUSCAN Tours'". "The organisers of this scam went to great lengths to provide a facade of legitimacy," Perth Airport Police Commander David Bachi said. "Thankfully the travellers contacted Customs and didn't dismiss their concerns, allowing us to make the arrest." </body>

      <title>Kenya sackings follow Westgate probe</title>
      <description>Kenya's interior minister fires 15 immigration officers over security lapses as investigations into the Westgate shopping centre siege continue.</description>

      <body>Kenya's interior minister has sacked 15 immigration officers as investigations into the Westgate mall siege continue. Joseph Ole Lenku said the officials had endangered national security by issuing ID documents to illegal immigrants. He also said the government would start repatriating Somali refugees to prevent further attacks. At least 67 people died when militants from the Somali Islamist al-Shabab group attacked the Nairobi shopping centre last month. Kenya is host to the largest refugee camp in the world, Dadaab - home to about half a million people - near the Somali border, while it is believed that more than 30,000 Somali refugees live in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, alone. Mr Lenku said the sacked immigration officers would appear in court to face the law. The government would also be carrying out a thorough audit of identity cards and passports issued in the country in the last two years, he said. "This exercise will enable us flush out all those who have been issued with illegal passports and other identification documents," Kenya's Star newspaper quoted him as saying. "We have welcomed with open arms, refugees fleeing from insecurity in neighbouring countries but we won't allow them to harm us," he added in his address to journalists in Nairobi. "Because of the returning calm in some parts of the Federal Republic of Somali, the process of repatriating Somali refugees has started," he said. Kenya has about 4,000 troops in the south of Somalia as part of the UN-backed African Union force which has made significant advances against al-Shabab in the last two years, recapturing the area's main cities. But the militants still control many smaller towns and large rural areas of southern Somalia. The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Nairobi says this is not the first time those fleeing the violence in neighbouring Somalia have been thrust uncomfortably into the spotlight. Even before Westgate, some politicians had blamed elements in the country's Dadaab refugee camp for attacks inside Kenya, he says. Previous attempts to repatriate Somali refugees have met with strong resistance, both from the UN and Kenya's own courts, our reporter adds. But more than a month after the attack on the shopping mall, the Kenyan government is under pressure - both its handling of intelligence and its response to the attack itself have been called into question, he says. Somalia's envoy to Kenya, Mohamed Ali Nur, has warned against blaming the refugees. "These refugees who are in the camps are innocent people. I want to say that the refugees themselves have been victims. Some of them were killed, some women were raped, and kids were killed," Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper quoted him as saying on Tuesday. Al-Shabab, which is part of the al-Qaeda network, is banned as a terrorist group by both the US and the UK and is believed to have between 7,000 and 9,000 fighters. Its members are fighting to create an Islamic state in Somalia and the group said it had staged the Westgate attack in response to Kenya's presence on Somali territory. Officials initially said 10 to 15 gunmen were involved, but CCTV footage appears to show only four militants, who the Kenyan military say all died by the end of the siege. The BBC's Newsnight programme has revealed that one of the four attackers is suspected of being a 23-year-old Somalia-born Norwegian national, Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow. </body>

      <title>JonBenet parents 'should be charged'</title>
      <description>In 1999 a Colorado grand jury voted to charge the parents of slain child beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey in her 1996 murder, court documents show.</description>

      <body>A Colorado grand jury was prepared to charge the parents of a slain six-year-old beauty queen in her death, newly released court documents in the 17-year-old murder case show. The panel voted in 1999 to charge JonBenet Ramsey's parents with fatal child abuse and "accessory to a crime". But prosecutors declined to try John and Patsy Ramsey on any charges. JonBenet's body was found brutally beaten and strangled in her Boulder, Colorado, home in December 1996. The Ramseys always maintained their innocence. Lin Wood, a lawyer for John Ramsey, said the documents released on Friday meant "absolutely zero" to the investigation. "The documents today are a mere historical footnote, a small glimpse into the grand jury proceedings," Mr Wood said in a statement. "It's four pages of what would have likely been hundreds of volumes of testimony and exhibit." The prosecutor at the time, Alex Hunter, has not commented about the newly released documents. Patsy Ramsey died of cancer in 2006. The investigation into JonBenet's death gained national attention in the US after grisly details of the crime and videos of the girl performing in beauty pageants were publicised. The Ramseys were never charged, and DNA evidence eventually suggested someone else killed the girl. In 2008, prosecutors formally exonerated them in the murder and publicly apologised. Her killing remains unsolved. The release on Friday of the grand jury indictments came after a lawsuit by the Boulder Daily Camera newspaper and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP). The 1999 documents show the grand jury moved to charge Mr and Mrs Ramsey with child abuse resulting in death and with being an accessory to a crime. The documents allege the couple placed their daughter "in a situation which posed a threat of injury to the child's life or health" which led to her death, and then helped the killer evade discovery and prosecution. Alex Hunter, the Boulder County district attorney at the time, declined to sign the indictments, effectively dropping the charges. "I and my prosecutorial team believe we do not have sufficient evidence to warrant the filing of charges against anyone who has been investigated at this time," Alex Hunter, the Boulder County district attorney, said in 1999. Analysts say it is uncommon for a district attorney not to sign off on a grand jury decision. US grand juries are convened in secret and tasked with determining whether enough evidence exists to bring a suspect to trial. But prosecutors must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict - a substantially higher bar. JonBenet's body was found in the basement of her home on 26 December 1996 after her parents reported her missing. Her skull was fractured and she had been strangled. The couple offered a $100,000 (£61,700) reward for information about the killer. The Boulder police were also faulted for botching the initial search of the Ramseys' home. In 2008, former District Attorney Mary Lacy publically apologised to the Ramseys after new DNA evidence suggested the killer was not a family member. </body>

      <body>Two employees of Beijing's historical Forbidden City have been stabbed to death in a lunchtime brawl, Chinese police say. Police have arrested a 49-year-old suspect in the attack at one of China's most popular tourist attractions. They say the man, surnamed Zheng, was injured when found in an office nearby. He was taken to hospital. Police described the incident as a brawl among employees inside a workers' canteen. No tourists were injured. Security is already tight at the sprawling site - where ornate halls once housed China's emperors, their wives, concubines and offspring - as well as on nearby Tiananmen Square. Guards at airport-style checkpoints are on the lookout for sharp objects and cigarette lighters, the latter following a rash of self-immolations by Tibetan protesters in recent months. The Forbidden City, which was built in the early 1400s and is made up of more than 980 buildings, is a Unesco world heritage site drawing an estimated 14 million visitors a year. Knife attacks are becoming more common in Chinese cities, often as a violent expression of frustration against authority. But violence at major tourist sites is rare. During the 2008 Beijing Olympics, an American businessman was killed and his wife and a tour guide badly injured in a knife attack near the city's Drum Tower. </body>

      <body>Augusto Odone, who rejected medical opinion and created an oil to save the life of his son Lorenzo has died. The former World Bank economist died in Italy aged 80, said his family. Augusto Odone taught himself enough science to invent a treatment for his six-year-old son after he was diagnosed with a neurological disease and given two years to live. Lorenzo eventually died aged 30. The battle to help him was depicted in a 1992 Hollywood film, Lorenzo's Oil. Lorenzo Odone was diagnosed with adrenoleukodystrophy, or ALD, a neurological disease that progressively destroys the brains of young boys. The disease leads to the build-up of dangerous "long-chain" fatty acids, and within a year children are paralysed, blind and unable to speak. Doctors predicted that Lorenzo would die in childhood. But Augusto Odone and his wife Michaela refused to accept the prognosis for their son, and put all their energies into trying to find a treatment. Despite having no formal scientific training, Augusto Odone studied medicine and biochemistry, and concocted a mixture of acids from olive and rapeseed oils. The Odones eventually persuaded an elderly British chemist, Don Suddaby, to distil the formula, which became known as Lorenzo's Oil. After testing it on a family member, Augusto Odone gave the oil to Lorenzo, with dramatic results: his long-chain fatty acids started to drop to normal levels. Its success in delaying the onset of symptoms in Lorenzo was demonstrated by the fact he lived to the age of 30, far beyond what doctors had predicted. Scientific studies have shown that the oil has most effect on children who have the ALD gene but have not yet displayed any of the symptoms. The story of Augusto and Michaela Odone was depicted in Lorenzo's Oil, which starred Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon as the parents. After the death of his wife in 2000, Augusto Odone returned from the United States to his native Piedmont region of Italy, to be near his surviving children. </body>

      <body>A former National Security Agency (NSA) chief giving off-the-record interviews on a high-speed train has had his remarks reported live on Twitter. General Michael Hayden was talking off-the-record to journalists by phone when he was overheard by another passenger, a former political activist. Tom Matzzie said he waited half an hour before live-tweeting comments about US renditions and a "famous BlackBerry". The comments went viral on news websites and late-night television. Gen Hayden, who was alerted to the Twitter feed within about 15 minutes, then offered an interview to Mr Matzzie, who is now head of a company called Ethical Electric. "I just had a very nice conversation with Michael Hayden. He was a gentleman and we disagree," Mr Matzzie later tweeted. The two men were on a high-speed Acela train travelling from Washington, DC to New York late on Thursday afternoon. Mr Matzzie began tweeting details of the conversations from what he said was a distance of 8ft (about 2.4m) away. "On Acela listening to former NSA spy boss Michael Hayden give 'off record' interviews. I feel like I'm in the NSA. Except I'm in public," Mr Matzzie's Twitter feed read. The National Security Agency has come under intense criticism after revelations by ex-CIA contractor Edward Snowden that US intelligence conducted extensive web and phone surveillance on targets at home and abroad. Mr Snowden now faces espionage charges in the US and has been granted temporary asylum in Russia. Gen Hayden has defended his former agency's operations in the past and Mr Matzzie wrote that Thursday's interviews were also focused on NSA surveillance of foreign allies. As the former head of MoveOn.org Political Action, Mr Matzzie once campaigned against the US-led war in Iraq. He made clear his own feelings about the former NSA and CIA chief with a tweet reading, "There is a faint smell of sulfur on the train." He said Gen Hayden asked journalists to refer to him as a "former senior administration official" for comments described as "disparaging" to President Barack Obama's administration. Gen Hayden later gave a statement to the Reuters news agency saying he "didn't criticise" the president. "I actually said these are very difficult issues. I said I had political guidance, too, that limited the things that I did when I was director of NSA. Now that political guidance is going to be more robust. It wasn't a criticism," Gen Hayden said. </body>

      <title>Canada senator 'lied' in expense row</title>
      <description>Canadian Conservative Senator Marjory LeBreton accuses fellow Tory Senator Mike Duffy of lying in order to avoid punishment in a growing expenses row.</description>

      <body>A Canadian Conservative Party senator has accused another senator embroiled in an expenses row of lying in order to avoid political repercussions. Senator Marjory LeBreton says Mike Duffy spoke a "blatant falsehood". Mr Duffy, Pamela Wallin and Patrick Brazeau face suspension from the Senate without pay over accusations they claimed improper expenses. Mr Duffy has accused Conservative PM Stephen Harper's office of attempting to cover up the matter. On Thursday, Ms LeBreton spoke as the Senate debated motions to suspend Conservatives Mr Duffy, Ms Wallin and Mr Brazeau. "There is no joy in having this whole situation before us," she said, speaking in favour of the suspensions. Days earlier, Mr Duffy accused Mr Harper's office of wielding "bribery, threats and extortion" in an effort to cover up a growing expenses row. Mr Duffy said Mr Harper's office sought to force him to repay taxpayer-reimbursed expenses that Mr Duffy believed were properly claimed. Ms LeBreton challenged the allegation: "The story that Senator Duffy spun in this place is not based in facts and it certainly leaves open to question what he was talking about and what he was thinking." She said Mr Duffy spoke a "blatant falsehood" in order to avoid being expelled from the Senate over the expenses matter. On Wednesday, Mr Harper denied involvement in the affair, telling the House of Commons he had been unaware of Mr Duffy's activities. Canadian senators are appointed by the governor general of Canada - the Queen's representative - on the advice of the prime minister. They typically join either the government caucus or the opposition caucus, or sit as independents. Mr Duffy has been accused of seeking reimbursement for living expenses associated with a home in Ottawa, thought that, rather than a cottage in his home province of Prince Edward Island, was his primary residence. He has argued the expense claims were within government guidelines for the reimbursement of senators who live outside Ottawa but must maintain a second home there. Mr Duffy has said Mr Harper ordered him to repay the government after months of negative publicity. But he declined, arguing that to pay back money to which he was entitled would damage his reputation. He then accused Mr Harper's office of "bribery, threats and extortion", and said Mr Harper threatened to force him from his Senate seat in order to cover up the row. Mr Duffy's lawyer says the prime minister's office sought a way to repay the 90,000 Canadian dollars ($86,336; £53,292) it said Mr Duffy owed the taxpayers in order to put an end to the potentially damaging row. Mr Duffy reportedly agreed in order to avoid an audit. Mr Harper's chief of staff Nigel Wright said in May that he provided the money to Mr Duffy, prompting an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Mr Wright later resigned his post. "Any assertion that I was in any way consulted or had any knowledge of Mr Wright's payment to Mr Duffy is categorically false," Mr Harper later told the media. "Had I known about it, I would not have permitted it." Mr Duffy, Ms Wallin and Mr Brazeau have left the Conservative Senate caucus after audits uncovered what officials labelled "troubling" expenses claims. The government leader in the Senate Claude Carignan later recommended that the three be suspended, saying the move was needed "to protect the dignity and reputation of the Senate". While Ms LeBreton spoke in favour of the suspension, Conservative Senator Donald Plett defended his three colleagues, arguing the punishment would set a precedent enabling the Senate to punish merely unpopular members. Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau, meanwhile, has sought to pin the row on Mr Harper. "A leader takes responsibility when things go wrong and this prime minister has consistently avoided taking any responsibility for this sordid mess," Mr Trudeau said. But the Liberal Party has also been touched by the expenses row. Ex-Liberal Senator Mac Harb left the chamber in August, dropping a dispute of an order that he repay 231,000 Canadian dollars ($220,000; £141,000) in expense reimbursements deemed improper. </body>

      <title>US healthcare IT contractors grilled</title>
      <description>Contractors who worked on the much-maligned US healthcare website tell lawmakers that the Obama administration must share the blame for its glitches.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24658892</url>

      <body>Contractors who worked on the much-maligned US healthcare website have told lawmakers the Obama administration must share the blame for its glitches. One senior executive told a congressional panel that the federal government was "the ultimate responsible party". The panel also heard that two contractors wanted more testing before the 1 October launch of the website. The Obama administration is in damage-control mode over the troubled rollout. At a health centre in Arizona on Thursday, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said technicians and administration officials were working "24-7" to fix glitches in the website and its technical underpinnings. And she dismissed Republicans' calls for her to step down over the problematic healthcare rollout, saying those critics "do not want this programme to work in this first place". Amid the fallout, the White House late on Wednesday announced it would push back by six weeks the healthcare law's requirement for individuals to buy insurance or face a tax penalty. Thursday's testimony before the House energy and commerce committee began with Republican legislators arguing that the healthcare.gov website flaws were part of wider problems in the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which is commonly known as Obamacare. "The American people deserve something that works, or start over," Representative Tim Murphy said, suggesting that the law be suspended until the problems are fixed. The website is one part of the larger law, which includes increased requirements for insurance firms, a requirement that individuals carry insurance or pay a tax penalty, and subsidies for those who qualify to assist in the cost of the insurance. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office previously said about seven million people would gain coverage through the federal website and others run by some states during the first year of operation. Democrats have lamented the technical issues but have defended the law, while criticising Republican attempts to undermine it. "Republicans don't have clean hands coming here," Democratic Representative Frank Pallone said. The website's glitches were politically overshadowed by a 16-day government shutdown, which began after Republicans tried to gut the law through budgetary brinkmanship in Congress. On Thursday, Cheryl Campbell, a senior vice-president of the Canadian-firm CGI, which created the front-end portion of the website, said that overwhelming interest from consumers had triggered the website problems. "No amount of testing within reasonable time limits can adequately replicate a live environment of this nature" Ms Campbell said. But she also blamed administration officials, saying the health department should have served as the "quarterback" on the project and was the "ultimate responsible party for the end-to-end performance". Andy Slavitt of QSSI, which created several elements of the online healthcare exchange, said a late decision to require consumers to create accounts before they could browse insurance plans contributed to the slow, malfunctioning website. "This may have driven higher simultaneous usage of the registration system that wouldn't have occurred if consumers could window-shop anonymously," Mr Slavitt said. Republican Representative Joe Pitts questioned this decision, pointing out that "window-shopping" was widely used in e-commerce, including in another government healthcare website for the elderly. "Who made that decision? When was it made? Why was it made?" Mr Pitts asked during the hearing. Republican Representative Fred Upton said the Obama administration "appears allergic to transparency and continues to withhold enrolment figures" for the healthcare website. "We still don't know the real picture," he said. "This is not about blame - this is about accountability, transparency, and fairness for the American public." And some Democrats on the panel said they were frustrated with both the government's and contractors' handling of the situation. Representative Anna Eshoo, a Democrat who represents the Silicon Valley area, said it was a "lame excuse" to blame the website's problems on a crush of visitors. "Amazon and eBay don't crash the week before Christmas," Ms Eshoo said. "ProFlowers doesn't crash on Valentine's Day." And Democratic Congresswoman Diana DeGette said: "These problems need to be fixed, and they need to be fixed fast." Ms Sebelius and other government officials are set to testify in front of legislators in a hearing next week. She was ridiculed earlier this month during an appearance on The Daily Show when the host Jon Stewart pulled out a laptop and said: "I'm going try and download every movie ever made, and you're going to try and sign up for Obamacare and we'll see which happens first." In response to the outcry over the technical issues, the administration will begin daily status briefings on the system, starting on Thursday. On Wednesday, US health officials admitted the online system did not get enough testing before going live on 1 October, especially at higher volumes. The health law also allowed individual states to set up their own online insurance exchanges. Fourteen states and the District of Columbia went with this option - those websites have not reported so many problems. </body>

      <description>A huge explosion and fire at a sweet factory in the northern Mexico city of Ciudad Juarez kills at least one person and injures dozens.</description>

      <body>At least one person has died and dozens more are injured in an explosion and fire that tore through a sweet factory in northern Mexico. A boiler is believed to have exploded in the Dulces Blueberry factory at an industrial park in Ciudad Juarez, causing the ceiling to collapse. About 300 people were said to be in the factory at the time and several are still unaccounted for. Fire crews and about 30 ambulances were at the scene. Ciudad Juarez Civil Protection Director Fernando Mota said firefighters found a body inside the factory and that six of the injured were in a serious condition. He said several workers were missing and could be trapped inside the building. "We're still searching the area to see if there are more dead," he added. Footage from the scene showed local people gathering outside, many of them in tears as they awaited news of friends or relatives. Paramedics were treating the injured, some of whom were badly burned. Ciudad Juarez is in the state of Chihuahua on the border with the US state of Texas. Factories such as the one affected, known as maquiladoras, are located in a free trade zone between the United States and Mexico. They are estimated to employ more than one million Mexicans. The BBC's Will Grant in Mexico City says maquiladoras are often criticised by labour rights groups for their low wages and poor working conditions, as they try to compete with China to manufacture cheap goods for the US market. </body>

      <title>Cuba to scrap two-currency system</title>

      <body>Cuba is to scrap its two-currency system in the latest financial reform rolled out by President Raul Castro, official media report. Since 1994 Cuba has had two currencies, one pegged to the US dollar and the other worth only a fraction of that. The more valuable convertible peso (CUC) was reserved for use in the tourism sector and foreign trade. Now its value will be gradually unified with the lower-value CUP, ending a system resented by ordinary Cubans. The Cuban economy is almost entirely state-run and the tourism sector has boomed since the collapse of the Soviet Union plunged Cuba into economic isolation and hardship. The two-currency system was supposed to protect Cuba's fragile economy but angered locals paid in the much lower-value CUP and denied access to goods only available for those with convertible pesos. The policy exacerbated the creation of a two-tier class system in Cuba which divided privileged Cubans with access to the lucrative tourist and foreign-trade sectors from those working in the local economy - all-too-visibly contradicting Cuba's supposedly egalitarian society. The council of ministers has approved a timetable for implementing "measures that will lead to monetary and exchange unification", the official Communist Party newspaper Granma said. Unification is "imperative to guarantee the re-establishment of the Cuban peso's value and its role as money, that is as a unit of accounting, means of payment and savings", it said. It gave no details of how quickly the change would be implemented, though Reuters news agency quoted Cuban economists as saying it would take about 18 months. </body>

      <description>Wikipedia begins piloting a service that sends articles via text message, primarily aimed at users in Africa.</description>

      <body>Wikipedia has begun piloting a service that sends articles via text message, primarily aimed at users in Africa. The online encyclopaedia has partnered with mobile operator Airtel to offer the free initiative which is being tested out in Kenya. It is hoped the service will be used to reach people who do not have internet access. The trial will be active for three months, said Dan Foy, technical partner manager for the Wikimedia Foundation. "Throughout most of the developing world, data-enabled smartphones are the exception, not the rule," he wrote. "That means billions of people currently cannot see Wikipedia on their phones." To activate the service - called Wikipedia Zero - users need to dial *515#, after which they will receive a text message prompting them to search for articles. Adoption of cheap mobiles in Africa is widespread, and in many regards the mobile industry across the continent is more advanced than in more developed parts of the world. For instance, the sending of money via text message is extremely popular - one service, M-Pesa, boasts 17 million users in Kenya alone. Western technology companies see the region as a major source of future growth. Facebook, for example, is approaching saturation point in its current markets, and so it is looking at methods to adapt its services to suit those with more basic technology. The social network also launched a drive to get other technology companies looking at ways to make access easier - starting with bringing down costs of accessing mobile data. Tom Jackson, who edits African technology news website HumanIPO, said Wikipedia's initiative would be warmly welcomed. "There has been a steady move towards putting educational material online in many African countries, led mainly by the private sector rather than governments, but access to the internet remains a problem given that most Africans surf on their phones rather than browsers. "This step increases the chances of access, especially as there is functionality to provide Wikipedia via SMS. Feature phones are still dominant in Africa, so this is a helpful addition." He added: "I just hope it comes with the same warnings that European and American kids are given about taking Wikipedia at face value!" Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <body>The International Criminal Court has told Kenya's Deputy President William Ruto he must attend most of his trial on charges of crimes against humanity. Prosecutors had appealed against an earlier decision which would have let him spend most of his time in Kenya. While he must appear at most of his trial, the court ruled he can be excused on a "case by case" basis. Mr Ruto's lawyers argued he was needed in Kenya after the attack by Islamist militants on the Westgate centre. He denies responsibility for post-election violence in 2007 and 2008. An estimated 1,200 people were killed in the ethnic bloodshed and about 600,000 fled their homes. His lawyers argued that justice could be met in his absence. At least 67 people were killed when militants believed to be from the Somali al-Shabab group stormed the shopping centre last month. In their ruling on Friday, judges were critical of the initial decision to give the deputy president a "blanket excusal" before the trial had even commenced. He will be allowed to apply to miss portions of the case but his absence will only be allowed when it is absolutely necessary. The BBC's Anna Holligan in The Hague says that the ruling reinforces the power of the ICC to hold the most powerful to account. However, Friday's ruling could deepen tensions between the court and African leaders who accuse it of unfairly targeting their continent, correspondents say. Mr Ruto has, so far, attended much of his case. Friday's judgement could also affect the trial of Kenyan President Uhuru, whose trial on similar charges is scheduled to start next month. The prosecution is still considering whether to appeal against a decision to allow the president to miss parts of his trial. Mr Kenyatta argued that attending the trial in The Hague would prevent him from governing the country. Our correspondent says that Mr Ruto, Mr Kenyatta and journalist Joshua Sang comprise the "Big Three" accused of instigating and co-ordinating the post-election killings in which innocent people including women and children were shot and hacked to death. But our correspondent says that was six years ago, and today Kenya is on the frontline of the battle against the global threat posed by al-Qaeda and its global affiliates. Mr Ruto's trial began in September. The deputy president is the first serving government official to stand trial in an international court. Many experts in international law believe that his case reflects the apparently incompatible demands of historical restorative justice versus future global security. Experts believe that the ICC is in an impossible position, fighting against the tide of international pressure to placate the government in Nairobi. </body>

      <title>China court rejects Bo Xilai appeal</title>
      <description>A high court in China has rejected the appeal of top politician Bo Xilai, jailed for life for bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power.</description>

      <body>A Chinese court has rejected the appeal of former politician Bo Xilai and upheld his life sentence for bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power. The former Chongqing Communist Party leader was convicted of the charges in September. He was removed from office in 2012 amid a scandal which saw his wife convicted of a British businessman's murder. The high court in Shandong, the province where Bo's trial was held, accepted his appeal earlier this month. "The facts of the first instance verdict are clear, the evidence is reliable, sufficient and the sentence is appropriate," the high court said in its ruling, which was posted on its website. "The court rules as follows: reject the appeal, uphold the original verdict. This verdict is the final ruling." The hearing appeared to have been brief, with the verdict coming about an hour after a convoy believed to be carrying Bo was seen arriving at the court. Footage from state broadcaster CCTV showed Bo's elder son, Li Wangzhi, in court with other relatives. Bo only receives one chance to appeal and his sentence is now final. He could submit a complaint to the Supreme People's Court in Beijing, but the vast majority of such complaints are rejected and do not result in another trial, reports the BBC's Celia Hatton in Beijing. Correspondents said few expected Bo's conviction to be overturned. The courts are controlled by the ruling Communist Party, from which Bo was expelled from last year. Bo Xilai, the charismatic former party chief in the city of Chongqing in south-western China, was a member of the powerful politburo - one of the 25 most senior party officials in the country. But he was removed from office last year amid a scandal which began when his deputy, Wang Lijun, sought refuge in the US consulate in Chengdu. The incident prompted an investigation into the death of British businessman Neil Heywood. Bo Xilai's wife, Gu Kailai, was eventually convicted of Mr Heywood's murder - a crime caused, the court said, by a financial dispute. Wang was also jailed for 15 years for helping Gu cover up the murder. Bo himself was found guilty of taking bribes amounting to 20m yuan ($3.3m, £2m) either personally or through his family. He was also accused of abusing his office by using his position to cover up for his wife's crime. Bo's supporters, however, believe he is the victim of a political purge. His downfall came as China prepared for its once-in-a-decade leadership transfer, as one generation of leaders made way for the next. Bo had been seen as a candidate for the very top, until his fall from grace. It was the biggest political shake-up to hit China's ruling elite in decades. The final verdict in the Bo case comes weeks before the Communist Party holds a major meeting in November to set economic policy. </body>

      <title>Maldives opposition MPs 'harassed'</title>
      <description>The main Maldives opposition party accuses the government of harassment after one of its MPs and another opposition-aligned MP are dismissed.</description>

      <body>The main Maldives opposition party has accused the government of harassment after one of its MPs and another opposition-aligned MP were dismissed. They were ejected from parliament by the Supreme Court but the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) accused judges of collaborating with the government. An aide to the president has dismissed the allegation as "absolutely wrong". The dismissed MPs say they will not accept the court ruling and will continue to serve as MPs regardless. The situation in the Maldives is tense after the first round of a presidential election held in September was annulled by the Supreme Court. The court ruled that electoral lists included made-up names and those of dead people. International observers had all praised the conduct of the first-round election - in which former President Mohamed Nasheed, of the MDP, got 45% of the vote. A second attempt at a vote was blocked by police last Saturday in a move declared illegal by the country's Human Rights Commission. The new election will now be held on 9 November, and a run-off - if required - on 16 November. In a 4-3 majority, the Supreme Court disqualified the two MPs - Ali Azim and Mohamed Nashiz - from parliament for the non-payment of a debt of $9m (£5.5m) for which they had signed as loan guarantors. The Maldives chief justice, who was also on the bench, disagreed with the majority view that the MPs' alleged offence made them liable for disqualification. Ahmed Naseem, who served as foreign minister under Mr Nasheed, told the BBC the case was an old one and had been resuscitated to reduce the MDP's thin majority in parliament. He described the ruling as "totally biased and unconstitutional". The party says corruption charges against government-aligned MPs have, in contrast, been dropped. There are also police notices against three other MDP parliamentarians for alleged contempt of court. A further one is the subject of an arrest warrant from the criminal court in a case of alleged alcohol and drug use. He has taken refuge in parliament. Masood Imad, President Mohamed Waheed's aide, said it was "sad" that the MDP was blaming the government over the MPs' fate. "The government has nothing to do with this - it's a judicial matter," he said. "We don't have any control over the judiciary and don't interfere with judicial matters." In another development, the office of Mr Nasheed said there had been threats to his life from "al-Qaeda agents". A spokesman for the office said it did not know who might be responsible but added: "I'm assuming the threat is real because there have been many such attempts in the past." The spokesman has asked state security bodies to check the information and ensure Mr Nasheed's security. On the death threat allegation, Mr Imad said that if Mr Nasheed gave a clear indication of who the alleged al-Qaeda figures were, "we'll arrest them and throw them out of the country". </body>

      <title>Women gain as gender gap 'narrows'</title>
      <description>The gender gap is narrowing across the world, a World Economic Forum report suggests, with Nordic countries leading the way but Arab nations lagging behind.</description>

      <body>The gap between men and women has narrowed slightly in the past year in most countries, according to a World Economic Forum (WEF) report. Iceland, Finland and Norway top the list of 136 nations, based on political participation, economic equality and rights like education and health. The Middle East and North Africa were the only regions not to improve in the past year, with Yemen at the bottom. The Philippines and Nicaragua both feature in the top 10. The WEF has produced the report annually for the past eight years. The release of this year's edition comes as the BBC rounds off a month-long focus on women and gender around the world with a major event at Broadcasting House in London. One hundred women from all around the world are gathering for a day of debate and discussion as the 100 Women season comes to an end. Iceland's position at the top of the WEF rankings was the fifth year in a row the country has been named the world's most equal. Report founder and co-author Saadia Zahidi told the BBC that since the WEF began compiling the index in 2006, 80% of countries had made progress. "What's worrying though is that 20% of countries have made no progress or are falling behind," she said. She singled out the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia as countries that had invested in education and health, but had not integrated women into the economy. Nadia al-Sakkaf, editor of the English-language Yemen Times, in London for the 100 Women conference, told the BBC that she had stopped counting the years her country had languished at the bottom of the equality list. "It comes down to everyday life. We had three women running for president in 2006. We have lots of women in senior positions," she said. "But our levels of maternal mortality are very high, and 35% of girls aged 6-14 years old are not in school." Human capital Saadia Zahidi of the WEF said that by contrast many sub-Saharan countries had not invested in women, but through necessity they played a major role in the economy. Nordic countries continued to lead the way because they had a long history of investing in people, she said. "They are small economies with small populations; they recognise that talent matters, and that talent has to be men and women. Overall, the report, entitled Global Gender Gap Report 2013, found Iceland to be the most advanced country in the world in terms of gender equality for the fifth year running. Iceland, Finland (second), Norway (third) and Sweden (fourth) had all closed over 80% of the gender gap, where 100% would represent full equality. The highest-ranked Asian nation was the Philippines (fifth), praised for its success in health, education and economic participation. Asia's major economies performed poorly, with China in 69th place and Japan 105th. Nicaragua in 10th place was the highest positioned country in North and South America, and was praised for a "strong performance" in terms of political empowerment. Among major world economies Germany ranked 14th (down one), the UK held its position at 18, with Canada at 20 and the United States 23rd. On matters of health and survival, the report finds that 96% of the gap has now closed. In terms of education, the global gender gap is 93% closed, with 25 countries now judged to deliver equal treatment to boys and girls at school. It is a different picture on the core issue of economic equality, where the gender gap has closed by 60%. In developing and developed countries alike, women's presence in economic leadership positions is limited. And while women have made small gains in political representation - 2% this year - only 21% of that global gender gap has closed Ms Zahidi said the idea of the report was not to remind poor countries that they had fewer opportunities than rich countries, but to give them a tool to improve the situation. "Women make up one half of the human capital available to any economy and any company; if that talent isn't integrated, that is going to be a loss for both women and men," she said. </body>

      <title>Migrants rescued as EU leaders meet</title>
      <description>Italian authorities intercept some 800 migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean, as EU leaders meet in Brussels to discuss the problem.</description>

      <body>Italian authorities have intercepted some 800 migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean as EU leaders meet in Brussels to discuss the problem. Dozens of women and children were among more than 200 migrants on one boat found in difficulty 25 miles (40km) south of the island of Lampedusa. Two other boats were picked up further south of Lampedusa, one with nearly 100 Eritreans reportedly on board. Hundreds of migrants trying to reach Europe have drowned in recent weeks. Southern EU states including Italy and Malta have relaunched appeals for more support and resources, prompting the European Commission to call on EU countries to offer "additional and urgent contributions". The Commission is pressing for: However, national governments point out there are significant obstacles to some of these ambitions - including the lack of a stable government in Libya. European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said on Friday that EU leaders all agreed that "determined action should be taken in order to prevent the loss of lives at sea". But he noted that migration flows were "complex phenomena". "We want to continue to address the root causes of illegal migration flows, working with countries of origin and transit, and this includes EU development support and a wider political dialogue with third countries," he said at a summit press conference. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said short-term measures should be taken in Lampedusa, and that discussions about an EU migration task force and EU border agency Frontex would be continued at another summit in December - but long-term policy would be addressed only next year. She said she did not expect a "sea change" in the way Europe deals with asylum-seekers. EU sources say leaders want to see a new surveillance effort, Eurosur, come into force, before committing more money or resources. Maria Nicolini, the mayor of Lampedusa, the Italian island where many of the bodies have been brought ashore, was in Brussels to lobby EU leaders. Many of the migrants who try to cross the Mediterranean come from developing countries afflicted by poverty and conflict, such as Syria and Eritrea. The UN special rapporteur on human rights in Eritrea said on Thursday that thousands Eritreans were fleeing their country every month, despite a "shoot-to-kill policy" targeting those attempting to leave. The envoy, Sheila Keetharuth, said Eritreans were subject to "the most serious human rights violations", including extra-judicial killings, torture and inhumane prison conditions. She said that according to UN figures, 7,504 Eritreans and 7,557 Syrians had arrived in Italy in the first nine months of the year. Boats, often operated by trafficking gangs, have been attempting the crossing to Europe for many years. But the issue was brought to the fore earlier this month when more than 350 people - mostly Somalis and Eritreans - died after their boat sank off Lampedusa. "Europe can neither save nor welcome the whole world," European Parliament President Martin Schulz told the EU summit. "But we are the world's richest continent and so must do more, especially if we act together, seek solutions together, and together take responsibility." </body>

      <title>Syria: Polio epidemic fears grow</title>
      <description>The number of suspected cases of polio among children in Syria is believed to have risen sharply, with at least 22 people now thought to be suffering from the disease, health officials say.</description>

      <body>At least 22 people - most of them babies and toddlers - are now believed to have contracted polio in Syria, the World Health Organization has reported. If confirmed, it would be the first outbreak of the disease there in 14 years. Syria's Health Ministry began an immunisation drive on Thursday. Before Syria's civil war began in 2011, some 95% of children were vaccinated against the disease. Now, Unicef estimates 500,000 children have not been immunised. WHO said the suspected outbreak centres on the eastern province of Deir Ezzor. "There is a cluster of 22 acute flaccid paralysis cases that is being investigated in that area," WHO spokesman Oliver Rosenbauer told Reuters news agency. "Everybody is treating this as an outbreak and is in outbreak response mode." Two cases have already been confirmed by laboratory tests while the WHO expects final laboratory confirmation on the remaining 20 cases next week. There are more than 100,000 children, all under age five, now at risk of polio in Deir Ezzor province alone, which has been caught in fierce battles between Syrian government forces and opposition fighters. The city of Deir Ezzor remains partially controlled by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, while the countryside is in the hands of the opposition. The WHO is now working with the UN, Syria's Health Ministry and other agencies on a mass immunisation programme. But it is expected to be a difficult undertaking, says the BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva, given the widespread insecurity and estimates that over half of Syria's medical professionals have left the country. More than four million Syrians have been displaced internally by the conflict and generally live in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. The WHO has already reported increases in cases of measles, typhoid and hepatitis A. Aid agencies are also developing emergency immunisation plans for Syrian refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Egypt. "Obviously, we're extremely worried about the situation," Simon Ingram, a spokesman for Unicef's operations in the Middle East, told the BBC. "People are flooding across borders in an uncontrolled manner and this increases the possibilities and means by which the virus can spread." The highly contagious disease is most often spread by consuming food or liquid contaminated with faeces. Polio has been largely eradicated in developed countries but remains endemic in Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Worldwide, polio cases have fallen from an estimated 350,000 at the start of a WHO-led immunisation campaign in 1988 to just 223 reported cases last year. There is no known cure, though a series of vaccinations can confer immunity. Young children are particularly susceptible to paralytic polio, the most serious form of the disease. </body>

      <body>A spokesman for the Saudi interior ministry has warned women that measures may be taken against them if they take part in a campaign against a ban on female drivers. A new campaign to give women the right to drive will culminate in Saudi Arabia this Saturday. Women are being encouraged to take to the wheel in defiance of the ban. It is the third protest of its kind; in the first in 1990, a number of women were arrested or lost their jobs. The interior ministry spokesman, Mansour al-Turki, has considerably toughened the Saudi government line on the women drivers' campaign. A previous statement on Wednesday was confusing, with both those pro- and anti- the campaign believing it favoured them. But now Mr Turki has explicitly restated that women are prohibited from driving, with violators - and their supporters - likely to face unspecified measures. A campaign activist, Zaki Safar, said that this was an unusually explicit statement of the ban, which is informal rather than enshrined in Saudi law. "It is no longer an issue of a social choice - that the government does not itself support the ban," Mr Safar told the BBC. "No, the spokesman was very clear. And any woman who drives on the 26th will face punishment." But Mr Safar believes the government is still sending mixed messages, as it is itself divided over whether to lift the ban. Earlier this week, about 100 conservative clerics asked for an audience at the royal court in the capital, Riyadh, to denounce the campaign as a conspiracy by women and a threat to the country. But there have been indications of a less hardline attitude by the authorities than back in 1990, and at the second protest in 2011. As part of the latest campaign, dozens of women have posted online videos of themselves driving in different Saudi cities. None of them has been arrested. The activists behind the campaign believe the public mood is changing, with many more people - including an increasing number of men - publicly supporting the lifting of the ban. Some 17,000 people have so far signed a petition calling either for change or a clear explanation of why it should remain in force.

      <title>Grangemouth plant to stay open</title>
      <description>The Grangemouth petrochemical plant near Falkirk is to stay open after a new deal was struck with workers.</description>

      <body>Political leaders and unions have welcomed news that the Grangemouth petrochemical plant is to stay open after a deal was struck with workers. Operator Ineos had announced on Wednesday that the plant was to shut, with the loss of 800 jobs, after union members rejected a survival plan. But the decision was reversed after the union agreed to Ineos's conditions. Ineos founder and chairman Jim Ratcliffe said it was "a victory for common sense". He confirmed Ineos would now press ahead with plans to invest £300m in a new gas terminal at the site, following a "significant change in attitude" from the Unite union. He added: "We have had assurances from the union yesterday that the changes we have requested in order for us to invest in that facility have been agreed and we are delighted to announce that Grangemouth will restart today, both the refining and petrochemicals side." The announcement on Grangemouth's future was greeted by huge cheers from the workforce, who had gathered at the plant to be told the news. The move brings to an end a bitter dispute with the Unite union which began over the alleged mistreatment of a Unite official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but Ineos shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a survival plan, which was initially rejected by union members. Reacting to the announcement, Unite Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said: "Relief will ring right round the Grangemouth community, and across Scotland today. "Hundreds of jobs that would have been lost can now be saved and £300m will be invested into the plant." The main points of the Ineos announcement included: First Minister Alex Salmond described the development as a "tremendous fillip for the workforce and the whole Grangemouth community, following what could have been a potential disaster". He said it had been "a great team effort from all concerned", including the unions and workforce, the management and governments. "I am delighted that people have rallied round to protect these jobs, and now we can all agree that Grangemouth has an outstanding future," he added. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael also welcomed the announcement, saying that it was "the news that we all wanted". "The staff and their families have been through a very stressful and uncertain time," he added. The announcement came as BP said it had reached an agreement with Ineos which would ensure that oil and gas supplies from the Forties Pipeline System would be secured. The pipeline - which brings oil and gas ashore from more than 50 North Sea fields - as well as BP's processing plant at Kinneil depend on steam and power from Grangemouth. BP said "some key commercial terms" had been adjusted in an existing deal with Ineos, but did not elaborate. It added: "By doing this, we have ensured that over a third of the North Sea's total oil and gas supplies will be unaffected, and that our motorist and airline customers will enjoy supply security." Ineos' future plans at Grangemouth include investing £300m in a new gas terminal at the site. Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean said: "It is a huge investment and that investment was only rightly to be done if we had a long-term sustainable base. "What we have now done is given the chemicals business another 15 to 20 years on the back of new raw materials, new contracts and significant investment." Mr MacLean would not dismiss the prospect of redundancies, but said they would be "very limited". The company has also said that 2,000 contractors it laid off after shutting down the complex would be re-hired to support investment in its survival plan. According to Ineos, the Scottish government has indicated it would support its application for a £9m grant to help finance its gas terminal plans, while the UK government has given "pre-qualification approval" for a £125m loan guarantee facility. Falkirk Council, which had planned to set up a task force to respond to the threatened closure, said the Ineos announcement was "the best possible outcome for all concerned". Council leader Craig Martin added: "There has been a tremendous effort behind the scenes to secure the plant's future involving UK and Scottish governments and Falkirk Council, working together to ensure the plant's survival. "This partnership approach has paid off and a more stable and positive future for the workforce has been delivered." </body>

      <title>Jack Straw to quit at next election</title>
      <description>Jack Straw is to stand down as Labour MP for Blackburn at the next general election, he announces.</description>

      <body>Jack Straw is to stand down as MP for Blackburn at the next general election. The former Labour home and foreign secretary 67, was elected in Blackburn in 1979 and has stood in eight general elections in the constituency. He said his "love affair" with the town was "not going to end on 7 May 2015, nor is my connection with it." Labour leader Ed Miliband paid tribute to Mr Straw's "eloquence and wisdom" and said he "will continue to serve our country in many different ways". Mr Straw said: "Whatever national position I have held, the citizens of this town, and their children, have always been my first priority. "I am deeply grateful to everyone in the town for the faith which has been placed in me." But he said he had made the decision to stand down after a great deal of thought and consultation with friends and family. He added he "couldn't go on forever" and it would be "a terrible wrench" to stand down. Mr Straw held the positions of home secretary, foreign secretary and leader of the House of Commons under Tony Blair. Gordon Brown made him justice secretary in June 2007, a position he held until Labour's defeat at the 2010 election. Mr Miliband said: "Jack Straw will be greatly missed from the House of Commons. "On behalf of the Labour Party, I want to thank him for his nearly 35 years service as an MP, his achievements in government and his eloquence and wisdom. "He is Labour through and through, and always displayed this in his words and deeds. "He will be sorely missed but I know he will continue to serve our country in many different ways." Mr Straw practised as a criminal barrister before entering the Commons and was an adviser to Labour minister Barbara Castle, his predecessor as Blackburn MP. </body>

      <body>Twitter has unveiled the price range for its shares when the company lists on the stock exchange. In a filing on Thursday, Twitter said it planned to sell 70 million shares priced between $17 and $20 (£10 - £12) to raise up to $1.4bn (£865m). The offering represents 13% of Twitter and values it at as much as $11bn. Analysts said the valuation, which was less than forecast, indicated the firm wanted to avoid the dip in prices that followed Facebook's listing. "They're trying to price this for a very strong IPO, ideally creating the conditions for a solid after-market," said Brian Wieser of the Pivotal Research Group. Facebook's shares were priced initially at $38 per share. The stock soared within hours of its debut to a high of $45 but later slumped. Some analysts had blamed over pricing of the shares as a reason behind the fall. However, Facebook shares have since recouped most of their losses and are now trading above the listing price. Twitter's share sale on the New York Stock Exchange will make it the biggest internet company to go public after Facebook. The microblogging site has seen steady growth since its launch seven years ago. According to its IPO documents, it now has 218 million monthly users and 500 million tweets are sent a day. However, all those users and tweets have not yet resulted in a profit. Twitter made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m. Some analysts said that while the lower-than-expected pricing may help its share prices in the days after the listing, in the long run investors would still need to see the firm make profits. "The fact that the valuation is lower than expectations, I think was smart by the underwriters. I think it will help the pop," said Michael Yoshikami of Destinational Wealth Management. "But in the end, even for $11bn, the question is can they come up with earnings to substantiate that number? And it's unclear that they're going to be able to do that." Almost 85% of Twitter's revenue currently comes from advertising on its site. There are three main ways for a company or an individual to advertise on Twitter: by promoting a tweet that will appear in people's timelines, promoting a whole account, or promoting a trend. Twitter tends to charge its advertisers according to the amount of interaction their content generates. Some analysts say the company has showing strong signs of growth, with revenue rising from just $28m in 2010 to $317m by the end of 2012. One research firm, eMarketer, has even estimated that Twitter's revenues from advertising sales will increase by more than 100% by the end of this year. </body>

      <title>Serco chief executive stands down</title>
      <description>The boss of security firm Serco resigns after accusations of overcharging the government tens of millions of pounds for electronic tags for criminals.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24672344</url>

      <body>The chief executive at Serco, a security firm at the centre of an overcharging scandal, has resigned. Outgoing boss Chris Hyman said the best way for the company to move forward "is for me to step back". Serco is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) after claims it had overcharged the government by "tens of millions" of pounds for electronic tags for criminals. The government welcomed the news, describing it as a "positive move". In July, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said an audit had revealed a "significant anomaly in the billing practices" of both Serco and rival G4S. Mr Grayling said that since 2005, the companies had in some cases been charging for tagging offenders who were in prison, had left the country or were even dead. In September, the government handed information to the SFO for their assessment. On Friday, Serco announced plans to reorganise the company. The firm said it would split the government work into a separate business that could be more closely monitored. For the moment, Mr Hyman's position will be taken over by Ed Casey, who runs the US division, while the company looks for an external full-time replacement. A government statement said it would "take full account of all the changes Serco have made today". "Whilst it is early days in their programme of renewal, this is a positive move by Serco and a step forward." The statement added that its review of government contracts, announced in July by the Justice Secretary, was continuing and would "ensure government's contractual arrangements are robust and taxpayers' money is spent responsibly, in a vibrant, competitive market for public services". Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan called for ministers to provide assurances that no confidentiality deals or "other arrangements that avoided justice" were being done. Mr Khan also asked ministers to "publish immediately the PriceWaterhouseCooper report into the activities of G4S and Serco." Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz said he was "surprised" by the resignation of Mr Hyman, because he "always maintained there is nothing untoward with the contracts Serco holds with the government". He said Mr Hyman maintained the position "even after the company was referred by Secretary of State for Justice to the SFO". Shares in Serco, which has in excess of 120,000 staff in more than 30 countries, rose after the news. It has lost more than 10% of its value since May - when the government first voiced its concerns over the tagging contract. "They were always going to have to make some sort of major change," Cantor analyst Sam Thomas said. "This is about transforming their recently damaged reputation and I think in appointing an external new chief executive they are hoping to draw a line under the previous issues." Mr Hyman said he had "always put the interests of Serco first", adding that it was important the relationship with the government was rebuilt. He said: "I have been fortunate enough to have had the privilege of working at a great company with extremely talented people. I wish everyone at Serco the very best for the future." No new contracts are being awarded to either of the firms until the audit is completed, the government said in September. The UK chief executive at G4S, Richard Morris, also stepped down on Thursday. The latest development in the scandal is likely to fuel debate over the value to the government of outsourcing public services to private companies, after G4S failed to provide enough security staff for the 2012 Olympics. </body>

      <title>UK growth fastest for three years</title>
      <description>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show, the fastest growth since 2010.</description>

      <body>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show. The Office for National Statistics said there had been a "fairly strong" performance across all sectors. The data builds on a 0.7% GDP rise in the April-June period and is the best quarterly performance since 2010. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne tweeted: "This shows that Britain's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity." Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the figures "show that we are firmly on the road to economic recovery". The ONS data for construction was up 2.5% over the quarter, the second successive quarter of growth after a volatile performance over the past year. The BBC's chief economics correspondent, Hugh Pym, said: "This could signal that a recovery in that sector is really under way." House-builders have been buoyed by the Government's Help to Buy scheme, which recently launched a new phase offering mortgage guarantees. The ONS said that production grew by 0.5%, though this remains 12.8% off its 2008 level, while within this, manufacturing improved 0.9% in the third quarter. The services sector, which represents three-quarters of economic output, grew by 0.7%. Output from services is now 0.4% above its pre-crisis peak in the first quarter of 2008. Friday's figure is the first estimate, and could be revised up or down in subsequent months. Mr Osborne told the BBC: "It shows that we are on the path to prosperity. Lots of risks remain, so we have to stick with the economic plan that has got us this far. "What's encouraging about these figures is that it's not just services that are growing. Construction is growing and manufacturing is growing." Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: "After three damaging years of flatlining, it's both welcome and long overdue that our economy is growing again. "But for millions of people across the country still seeing prices rising faster than their wages, this is no recovery at all." Despite the further evidence that recovery is gaining hold, some economists remain cautious. The Institute of Directors' chief economist Graeme Leach said: "The outlook looks better than at any time since the onset of the financial crisis. Indeed, our members have more confidence in the economy than at any time since 2008. "However, strong headwinds remain and the annual growth rate year on year is nothing to get too excited about yet. Though inflationary pressures are likely to remain benign, debt and inflation are rising faster than earnings. "By far the biggest challenges remain on the supply side, not the demand side. Supply side constraints mean that the current growth spurt is unlikely to extend beyond next year. "This stage of our economic recovery is likely to be short and sweet, instead of long and strong." The director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, John Longworth, said: "This is the highest quarterly increase we've seen in three years, so the economy is clearly moving in the right direction. "But we are still behind a number of advanced economies, such as the US and Germany, that have managed to recover the output lost during the economic downturn. "Much more needs to be done to transform our economy from being good to being really great." Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said the figures confirmed the UK was enjoying "a period of healthy and well-balanced growth". He said it was likely that the UK recorded the fastest quarterly growth rate within the G7 countries in the third quarter. But he added that a squeeze on real incomes as wage growth lagged behind inflation, together with the fiscal squeeze and a stagnant eurozone, were likely to prevent recovery gathering much more pace. It echoed remarks by Bank of England governor Mark Carney on Thursday evening, when he said in a speech that the rate of growth was "towards the top end of the advanced economies", but "coming from a very very low base". </body>

      <title>Fifa &amp; Uefa must stop racism - Toure</title>
      <description>Yaya Toure tells the BBC it is time to let Fifa and Uefa "do their work" after accusing CSKA Moscow fans of racism.</description>

      <body>Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure says it is time to let Fifa and Uefa "do their work" after accusing CSKA Moscow fans of racism. Toure claimed he was racially abused during Wednesday's Champions League win and suggested African players might boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Asked on Friday whether a boycott was still possible, the Ivory Coast player told BBC Afrique: "We're not here yet." He added: "Let's leave Fifa and Uefa to do their work." Toure spoke to referee Ovidiu Hategan during the 2-1 win over CSKA to complain about the behaviour of the home fans, although the Russian club have denied any racist abuse took place. The Romanian official chose to do nothing at the time, but Uefa - which governs European football - has since opened disciplinary proceedings against CSKA Moscow for the "racist behaviour of their fans". "Uefa has decided to do certain things. They have decided to apply the rules. That's all we want," said Toure. "A lot of things have been said about racism. If today an organisation and supporters stray from the straight path or slip up, the goal is to set them straight again. "We are all humans. It is not a nice feeling to go and play a football match - to bring joy to the people - and to be called a monkey or to hear monkey noises. I don't look like a monkey. That's what disappoints me so much." Toure had suggested after the match in Moscow that African players might decide not to play in the 2018 World Cup if nothing was done to tackle the issue of racism. But several Premier League managers believe talk of a boycott is either wrong or at best premature. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho insists threatening the 2018 World Cup is not the way to combat racism in football and urged players not to punish "billions" for the "disgraceful behaviour" of thousands. "If I was a black player, I would say the other billions are much more important, so let's fight the thousands, but let's give to the billions what the billions want," he said. "And the billions want the best football - and the best football without black players is not the best football." Manchester United manager David Moyes believes walking off the pitch would be allowing those responsible for the behaviour to win. "It is the people who come up against the racial abuse that should really answer the question but my feeling is I don't think walking off the pitch [works]," he said. "That gives the people chanting or shouting against you what they want. "That is not the way. Sanctions have to be taken on the club, the players and other supporters who are involved." Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said Uefa must complete its investigation before there is any more talk of a boycott. "It's a bit early because it's not proven what happened," he said. Manuel Pellegrini , Toure's manager at Manchester City, urged the European governing body to act. "Uefa have the right things in place to deal with the problem and they need to deal with the issue," said the Chilean. "I hope it won't happen again." While Uefa has said it is investigating Toure's complaint, its president Michel Platini has ordered an internal investigation  to find out why proper protocol was not followed in the handling of the incident. Kick It Out  chairman Lord Ouseley said Hategan should not officiate again for failing to deal with the alleged abuse. Manchester United defender Patrice Evra fears racism will never be beaten. Evra, victim of Luis Suarez's racist comments at Anfield two years ago, told MUTV: "I don't think we will stop the racism. "Fifa have to do something because every year we hear something about racism. "I am sad even to have to talk about it." </body>

      <description>South Africa are penalised five runs for ball tampering against Pakistan during the second Test in Dubai.</description>

      <body>South Africa have been penalised five runs for ball tampering during the third day of the second Test against Pakistan in Dubai. Replays showed Faf du Plessis rubbing the ball over a zip on his trousers. After talking to Proteas captain Graeme Smith during Pakistan's second innings, umpire Ian Gould awarded the additional runs to Pakistan. But South Africa vice-captain AB de Villiers said: "We are not a team that scratches the ball." The decision meant the umpires had decided the ball's condition had been changed contrary to the game's rules. It is expected the umpires will lay a charge against Du Plessis to match referee David Boon after the day's play, with an immediate hearing to follow. "We don't cheat, it is as simple as that," De Villiers continued. "I know Faf du Plessis very well, he's the last player on the field who will try something like that. "It is part of his responsibility to shine the ball and get it to swing. It's not an easy job and I thought he did it very well." Gould and fellow umpire Rod Tucker, who also ordered the ball to be changed, took the unusual action at the start of the evening session in Dubai, where South Africa are on the verge of completing a comfortable victory. After bowling Pakistan out for 99 in their first innings, Smith hit 234 and AB de Villiers 164 as South Africa made 517 in reply. Pakistan were 132-4 at the close on day three, needing a further 286 to avoid an innings defeat. "As per 42.1 of the ICC playing conditions, the umpires replaced the ball and fined the South Africa team five penalty runs for ball tampering," an ICC spokesperson confirmed. The last time a five-run penalty was issued for ball tampering was during the 2006 Oval Test between England and Pakistan, when the tourists were adjudged the guilty party. Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq reacted angrily and decided not to continue the Test in protest. Australian umpire Darrell Hair duly awarded the game to England - the only forfeited match in Test history. This month, the ICC amended its laws regarding the condition of balls, saying "if a player responsible can be identified" the ball will be changed, a five-run penalty will be awarded and the player responsible will be reported. Altering the condition of the ball is a level two offence under the ICC's code of conduct, which carries a penalty of 50-100% of their match fee and/or suspension from one Test or two one-day internationals for a first offence. </body>

      <body>England coach Steve McNamara cut short his news conference ahead of their World Cup opener against Australia. McNamara walked out after six minutes as he was questioned on his selection decisions. Second row forward Gareth Hock was removed from the squad after a breach of discipline following England's 15-14 defeat by Italy in a warm-up game. Prop James Graham has not been selected for Saturday's opener with the Kangaroos at the Millennium Stadium. Hock told the BBC that he does not think his breach of discipline was serious enough for him to be removed from England's World Cup squad. The forward, 30, said he and some team-mates went on a night out after England's surprise defeat by Italy. McNamara refused to discuss the disciplinary issues during the media conference and no players were made available to speak. The England coach was questioned about absence of Graham from his 19-man squad, amid speculation that the former St Helens forward had been involved in the post-Italy game incident. "There are seven very good players not playing this week," McNamara said. "I'm certainly not going to talk about any individuals among those seven. "They are all great players, great people and I'm sure they'll get a part to play during the rest of the tournament." McNamara denied it had been a tough week for him ahead of the opener with Australia and has faith in his squad despite disciplinary issues. "It's been a week as a coach, simple as that, preparing a team getting ready to face Australia and a team that under-performed last week against Italy," he said. "That's been the nuts and the bolts of the job this week. "I think the world of that squad, every single one of them and they will all play a part during this World Cup." McNamara became frustrated as he was questioned on disciplinary issues and said: "I'm not going to answer any more questions on it. If you want to continue asking the questions, then we'll wrap up now." McNamara briefly went on to talk about the match against Australia but ended the session abruptly when asked about Hock. Australia coach Tim Sheens denied he was pleased to see England's troubled build-up to Saturday's game in Cardiff. "I made the comment earlier in the week that an embarrassed side is a dangerous side," he said. "Anyone involved in sport understands that when things go wrong, it can have the exact reverse effect." </body>

      <body>Singer Manolo Escobar, whose best-selling track Y Viva Espana became part of Spain's cultural identity in the 1970s, has died aged 82. Escobar died at home in the town of Benidorm surrounded by his family, after a long fight against cancer. He was "a symbol who lived in the musical landscape of Spaniards for half a century," Spain's culture minister, Jose Ignacio Wert, said in a statement. "Music is my life," Escobar said this month. "I will never surrender." "I am happy because I have work and because, moreover, people are still prepared to pay to see me on stage," the singer said in an interview with Spanish newspaper ABC. "I want to return to a few of the places I have been to in my career of more than 50 years and say goodbye for good. I will sing one more time in each one so that I don't go back," he added. Born in a small village outside Almeria in October 1931, Escobar had a huge following in Spain in the 1960s and 1970s with hits such as El Porompompero and Mi Carro. A well-known personality thanks to his television show Canta Manolo Escobar, he also starred in films including The Guerrillas and Father Manolo, in which he played a singing priest. But it was the success of Y Viva Espana, in 1973, that made him an international star. The track was based on Eviva Espana, the 1971 song written by Belgian duo Leo Rozenstraten and Leo Caerts, and performed, in Dutch, by Samantha. Escobar's best-selling single, which coincided with a boom in international tourism, sold an estimated six million copies. In 1974, the track was covered by Swedish singer Sylvia Vrethammar, whose English version reached number four in the UK Singles Chart. One of Escobar's last big acts was in July 2010 when he sang with the Spanish football team to celebrate their victory in the World Cup in South Africa. He announced his retirement from music at the end of 2012 after 50 years on the stage. Last month, he had to cancel the final dates of his farewell tour after falling ill. He was undergoing treatment, reportedly for colon cancer, at Benidorm's Hospital Clinica, but is understood to have left on Tuesday. He died at home two days later. Escobar leaves a wife, Anita, and one daughter, Vanessa. </body>

      <body>British actor Tim Roth is to star as Fifa president Sepp Blatter in a film about football's governing body. Provisionally titled F2014, Gerard Depardieu will also appear in the movie as Jules Rimet - one of Fifa's founders and its longest-serving president. In a video published on Fifa's website, Blatter said Roth's casting was "well done" and they had "common qualities". The film is due for release next year, to coincide with Fifa's 110th anniversary and the World Cup. Production will take place in France, Brazil and Azerbaijan. The video showed Blatter meeting with Roth for the first time in Zurich, which Blatter said was "a very interesting get-together". "I had read a lot of the CV and all the [films] that Tim Roth has made [and] I was very eager to meet him," the 77-year-old said. The movie is being made by French production companies Leuviah and Thelma Films. Blatter has run Fifa since 1998 amid a series of controversies including allegations of corruption. In 2004 the Swiss was criticised for suggesting female footballers should wear tighter shorts and low cut shirts to attract more male fans, while in 2011 he insisted there was no racism in football and any incidents could be settled with a handshake. He was also at the centre of allegations of bribery resulting in Qatar's successful 2022 World Cup bid and was criticised for saying gay football fans should not have sex while in the nation, where homosexuality is illegal. He has since apologised for his remarks. Roth, 52, will soon be seen on the big screen as Prince Rainier of Monaco, opposite Nicole Kidman in Grace of Monaco. </body>

      <body>A new version of US drama Murder, She Wrote is in the works, starring Oscar winner Octavia Spencer. The Help star has signed on to appear in the pilot ordered by US network NBC, reports Deadline.. The new take will feature Spencer as a hospital administrator who is also an amateur detective. The original series, which starred Angela Lansbury, ran for 12 seasons on rival network CBS from 1984 to 1996. At the height of its popularity, it attracted some 23 million viewers in the US and earned Lansbury four Golden Globes for the role, as well as 12 consecutive Emmy nominations. NBC has ordered a "put pilot", which guarantees the episode will air, but does not guarantee it will be commissioned for a full series. It has been described as a "light, contemporary procedural in the vein of Bones or Fargo". "I've always considered myself an armchair detective and in a recent meeting with [NBC chairman] Bob Greenblatt, he asked me what type of character would be able to lure me to TV," Spencer said. "Naturally, I said JB Fletcher meets Colombo… and here we are." The pilot will be produced by David Janollari, who worked on Six Feet Under, and will be written by former Desperate Housewives executive producer Alexandra Cunningham. If the show gets picked up, it will be the first regular series for Spencer, who has previously guest-starred on numerous shows including Ugly Betty, The Big Bang Theory and Chuck Lorre's latest comedy Mom, starring Anna Faris and Allison Janney. Murder, She Wrote is NBC's latest "re-imagining" - it is also re-working 1980s crime series Remington Steele and 1994 film Reality Bites. </body>

      <body>DNA tests have confirmed a Bulgarian Roma couple as the biological parents of mystery child Maria, found in Greece last week, Bulgarian officials say. The officials are investigating whether Sasha Ruseva and Atanas Rusev sold the child - a crime that could result in a jail sentence. The Greek couple with whom Maria was found, Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulou, have since been charged with child abduction. They insist the girl was given to them. Mark Lowen in Athens says police will be left "red-faced" now that the story they were given when they removed Maria appears to have stood up. </body>

      <body>For five years in a row, Iceland has been rated the country with the world's smallest gender gap by the World Economic Forum (WEF). The rating means Iceland is the country where women enjoy the most equal access to education and healthcare. It is also where women are most likely to be able to participate fully in the country's political and economic life. Iceland is joined at the top of the The Global Gender Gap Report, 2013 by its Nordic neighbours Finland, Norway and Sweden. Overall, the gender gap narrowed slightly across the globe in 2013, as 86 of 133 countries showed improvements. However, "change is definitely slow", says one of the report's authors, Saadia Zahidi.

      <title>US goes nuclear in spy wars</title>
      <description>US wields 'nuclear arsenal' in global electronic spy war</description>

      <body>People and nations spy, even on friends. But in the realm of international electronic espionage, the US wields a nuclear arsenal while the rest of the globe fights with guns. The rusted gates in front of a building in Washington DC creak when they open and bang when they close. A camera anchored on a guardhouse watches the entrance. On a blustery Thursday afternoon, three women stand outside the building, smoking. It is, after all, the French embassy. The gates are designed to ward off intruders. So are security measures for computers and phones inside the building. They are, however, no obstacle for American spies. The embassy, at least according to media reports, has been bugged. Meanwhile computers used by French delegates at the UN have reportedly been under surveillance, as has the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. And the US National Security Agency has monitored millions of French telephone calls, according to Le Monde. According to the press accounts, Americans have been engaged in espionage on France, Germany and other countries - on a scale so vast that even jaded officials say they are taken aback. "I am not naive. I know intelligence services have to do their job. But if it is true, it's deeply shocking," says one Western official. "And if it's confirmed, the expression 'abuse of power', which has been used here and there, would not be entirely wrong. Of course, we are giving the US a chance to explain." James Clapper, US director of national intelligence, has contested as "inaccurate and misleading" the press accounts about US electronic espionage. US officials have not denied spying on Ms Merkel, nor on the French diplomats. US officials and those from other countries are still arguing over what happened. But no-one denies that nations spy, even on their friends. "The rule is that everybody spies on everybody - except when they have an agreement not to," says Steven Aftergood, head of a project on government secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. "And then they may still do so." Even given that tacit understanding, the US stands apart in the scope of its espionage capabilities. "Every country has weapons for spying, but most have the equivalent of a Howitzer," says James Bamford, who has written extensively on the National Security Agency. "In terms of eavesdropping, the US has a nuclear weapon." Aftergood says, "We are photographing and listening to the entire globe." In recent years, advances in technology have enabled the US to expand its electronic spying dramatically. The growth was driven in part by the effort to monitor threats after the al-Qaeda attacks in 2001. Yet European officials say wide-scale surveillance operations on citizens and world leaders are harder to justify than monitoring of suspected al-Qaeda leaders. The Europeans wonder not only why Americans would spy on their friends, but also whether these surveillance operations are legal. A former US official says they are considered carefully at the highest levels. A decision to spy on the head of a Western government, for example, would be authorised by the president. The president would seek the counsel of the National Security Council, a team of high-level advisers. Former officials and experts say decisions to spy on foreign leaders were likely made long ago - and adopted by presidents who later came into office. Spying on a foreign leader falls under executive order 12333, which covers espionage necessary to protect US interests. "Timely and accurate information about the activities, capabilities, plans and intentions of foreign powers, organisations and persons and their agents, is essential," the order reads. And when the target of surveillance is a foreign leader, the decision to spy on him or her would not fall under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The surveillance court considers government requests to collect information on Americans. Intelligence researchers and former US officials describe it as an open secret that even the closest of geopolitical allies spy on one another. "Allies spy on each other because they don't have identical interests," says Jeffrey Richelson, author of The US Intelligence Community. "There are very few allies that are so close that there's no point in collecting intelligence." In the 1920s and '30s, the UK used covert methods to monitor the US, he says. At some point following the end of World War II, the Americans and the British agreed no longer to spy on each other. Eventually they decided to include Australia, Canada and New Zealand in their consortium, a group known as the "Five Eyes" alliance. Espionage is part of statecraft, and these kinds of secret operations date back centuries. Today, however, because of revelations in the mass media - provided by ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden, for example - ordinary citizens, and not just spies and high-level officials, know about their governments' activities. "The politics of the debate have changed," says Suzanne Nossel, a former deputy assistant secretary of state in the Obama administration. "Things that we once suspected that were going on are going on. And things we never dreamed of are going on. There's no way that Europeans can lie back and accept that." </body>

      <title>Bitter feud dominates Georgia election</title>
      <description>Rivals for power in Georgia - yet neither is a candidate</description>

      <body>There might be 23 candidates in Sunday's presidential election in Georgia but in recent months two men already in power have been dominating the country's politics. And both are about to step down. They face each other from their palaces on opposite sides of the River Kura, which flows through the capital Tbilisi. One is the glass-domed structure of the country's President Mikheil Saakashvili, the second is an ultra-modern steel and glass mansion - the residence of the country's billionaire Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili. Mr Ivanishvili took office last year after his Georgian Dream coalition defeated President Saakashvili's allies in a parliamentary election. But there is very little face-to-face interaction between the two leaders, and their public statements are full of bitterness towards each other. In the West, President Saakashvili is known as a man who brought democracy to Georgia, which has been plagued by political violence since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991. But Mr Ivanishvili refers to the outgoing president as a "liar" and a "dictator". "He said one thing to the outside world, and did totally different things inside the country," Mr Ivanishvilli told the BBC from his residence. "Under Saakashvili, abuses of people's rights inside Georgia were widespread. Anyone could have been targeted and sent to jail. Prisons were overcrowded. Properties were illegally confiscated," he said. Addressing a group of students on Thursday, Mr Saakashvili said he and the prime minister had nothing in common. "I and Prime Minister Ivanishvili are from different planets, or to put it more correctly I am from this planet, from this country… We represent two different Georgias." Since coming to power in the bloodless 2003 "Rose Revolution" Mr Saakashvili has implemented reforms which helped root out corruption. He cut bureaucracy and improved public services in the Caucasus republic, where poverty remains widespread. The World Bank in a report in 2012 suggested Georgia's experience in fighting corruption could be exemplary for other nations facing similar problems. At a recent UN General Assembly meeting, Mr Saakashvili said he was proud of Georgia's accomplishments during his 10 years in office. But the country's prime minister has dismissed these achievements. "Corruption was eradicated among the police, his government was proud of this for years. But later, they used the police force to commit violence against people. So we can't say it was an achievement," says Mr Ivanishvili. "The biggest achievement, I would say, was the improvement of tax collection. Money started flowing into the state budget. But the budget was then abused - so this also cannot be counted as an achievement." His allegations of "elite" corruption have led to a number of arrests and investigations of former officials from Mr Saakashvili's administration. Mr Ivanishvili, who credits his own government with establishing a transparent judicial system, does not exclude the possibility that Mr Saakashvili could also find himself under investigation once his presidential immunity is lifted. "The process of restoration of justice is continuing, therefore such a probability cannot be ruled out," he said. In August, he announced that he would step down before the end of the year. "When I entered politics I said that I would stay for two or three years, accomplish my set goals and leave. Well, it took me less than three years. I put the country on the right path and no-one can reverse this process." Following Sunday's vote, constitutional amendments introduced in 2010 will come into effect that significantly reduce presidential powers. Georgia in effect will become a parliamentary democracy. But even after Mr Ivanishvili steps down there are concerns he could still run the country from behind the scenes, especially if his chosen presidential candidate Giorgi Margvelashvili - ahead in the opinion polls - wins. Mr Ivanishvili has not yet named a successor as prime minister. The presidential candidate of Mr Saakashvili's United National Movement (UNM), Davit Bakradze, is a former parliament speaker who accuses the ruling coalition of failing to deliver on its promises. </body>

      <title>Chinese villagers protest against land deal in Yunnan</title>
      <description>Chinese villagers battle police to stop tourist development on their land</description>

      <body>For days, police have been stationed on the outskirts of the tiny farming village of Guangji, in southern China's Yunnan province. They have been there since Tuesday, following a violent battle between villagers and police. At the centre of the dispute is a plot of farmland the villagers in Guangji and the surrounding area have used to grow crops for centuries. However, the local government plans to construct a $3.6bn (£2.2bn) tourist attraction on the land - a glitzy recreation of an ancient Chinese city. For months, three villagers have been circulating around the region, advising Guangji's 2,200 residents of their legal rights to the land. When the police arrived on Tuesday to arrest two of the men - Wang Zhengrong, 69, and his son, Wang Chunyun - the vast majority of the villagers banded together to force the police to leave. Wang Chunyun told the BBC that "a dozen thugs" found him on Tuesday evening and quickly surrounded him. When he asked them, "Who are you?", the men told him they were the police. When Mr Wang asked the men to show him their identification, they attacked him. He says he is now using Chinese herbs to treat his broken ribs, since he fears he will be arrested if he leaves the sanctity of the village. Mr Wang's father was also attacked and sustained multiple injuries, which caused him to lose consciousness twice. The older Mr Wang is described as a "proud communist" who fought for China in the Vietnam war by his friend and fellow village leader, Pu Yongfang. Locals report the police used tear gas and another unknown explosive against them, leading four villagers to sustain severe injuries and 40 more to also be hurt. Photos from the locals that were purportedly taken after the incident show villagers with blackened legs and fractured skulls the villagers appear to have tried to stitch up themselves. Villagers have told the BBC they are using Chinese herbs to treat their wounds and broken bones. They do not dare to leave the village, even to visit a nearby medical clinic, for fear of being arrested. According to state media reports, 27 police officers were also injured, leaving one officer in critical condition. An official who answered the phone at the Jinning County government hotline said she would not be able to provide any information on the incident for two days. An official at the Jinning police department refused to answer any questions. According to the Yunnan Daily, the province's main Communist Party newspaper, the Gu Dian Historic and Cultural Tourism Project will become one of the province's 10 landmark tourism sites. An artist's rendering of the project shows a vast complex of traditional Chinese buildings, decorated with golden rooftops and elaborate red columns. The project is expected to take three years to build and another two years to go into full operation. Disputes over farm land - who owns it and who has the right to earn money from it - in China often result in clashes between angry villagers, who feel the land belongs to them, and government officials, who are eager to boost investment and tax revenues in their region. It is unlikely the government will back down easily from this battle. Yunnan's Communist Party secretary, Qin Guangrong, attended an elaborate ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark the start of the tourist site's construction last October. Mr Qin's attendance highlights the level of the party's political stake in the multi-billion dollar plan that is touted as a plan to create jobs in Yunnan. Villages around the region are attempting to band together to stop officials from seizing any more of the land they will need to complete the project. In May, protests in the neighbouring villages of San He and An Jiang also resulted in violence. For now, tensions are running high inside Guangji village. Mr Pu, one of the village leaders, says villagers remain on "high alert". Ten thousand acres of farmland have already disappeared, he explains. And the locals here will do anything they can to prevent more from slipping through their grasp. </body>

      <title>Dino impact 'also decimated bees'</title>

      <body>Scientists say there was a widespread extinction of bees 66 million years ago, at the same time as the event that killed off the dinosaurs. The demise of the dinosaurs was almost certainly the result of an asteroid or comet hitting Earth. But the extinction event was selective, affecting some groups more than others. Writing in Plos One journal, the team used fossils and DNA analysis to show that one bee group suffered a serious decline at the time of this collision. The researchers chose to study bees within the subfamily known as Xylocopinae - which included the carpenter bees. This was because the evolutionary history of this group could be traced back to the Cretaceous Period, when the dinosaurs still walked the Earth. Previous studies had suggested a widespread extinction among flowering plants during the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event 66 million years ago. And it had long been assumed that the bees that depended upon these plants would have met the same fate. Yet, unlike the dinosaurs, "there is a relatively poor fossil record of bees," said the paper's lead author Sandra Rehan, a biologist at the University of New Hampshire in Dunham, US. This has made the confirmation of such an extinction difficult. However, the researchers were able to use an extinct group of Xylocopinae as a calibration point for timing the dispersal of these bees. They were also able to study flower fossils that had evolved traits that allowed them to be pollinated by bee relatives of the Xylocopinae. "The data told us something major was happening in four different groups of bees at the same time," said Dr Rehan. "And it happened to be the same time as the dinosaurs went extinct." The findings of this study could have implications for today's concern about the loss in diversity of bees, a pivotal species for agriculture and biodiversity. "Understanding extinctions and the effects of declines in the past can help us understand the pollinator decline and the global crisis in pollinators today," Dr Rehan explained. </body>

      <title>Get outside and go wild, kids urged</title>
      <description>Children are being urged to take back their "wild time" by playing outside more to regain a connection with the natural world.</description>

      <body>Children are being urged to take back their "wild time", swapping 30 minutes of screen use for outdoor activities. The call to renew a connection with nature comes from a collaboration of almost 400 organisations, from playgroups to the NHS. The Wild Network wants children to take up activities like conkers and camping. "The tragic truth is that kids have lost touch with nature and the outdoors in just one generation," said chairman Andy Simpson. The organisers argue that swapping 30 minutes of television and computer games each day for outdoor play would increase the levels of fitness and alertness and improve children's well-being "Time spent outdoors is down, roaming ranges have fallen drastically, activity levels are declining and the ability to identify common species has been lost," said Mr Simpson. He referred to recent research by the RSPB which suggested only one in five children aged eight to 12 had a connection with nature. "With many more parents becoming concerned about the dominance of screen time in their children's lives, and growing scientific evidence that a decline in active time is bad news for the health and happiness of our children, we all need to become marketing directors for nature," said Mr Simpson. "An extra 30 minutes of wild time every day for all under 12-year-olds in the UK would be the equivalent of just three months of their childhood spent outdoors. "We want parents to see what this magical wonder product does for their kids' development, independence and creativity, by giving wild time a go." The campaign launches on Friday with the release of a documentary film, Project Wild Thing. It tells the story of how, in a bid to get his daughter and son outside, film-maker David Bond appoints himself marketing director for nature, working with branding and outdoor experts to develop a campaign. "I wanted to understand why my children's childhood is so different from mine, whether this matters and, if it does, what I can do about it," said Mr Bond. "The reasons why kids, whether they live in cities or the countryside, have become disconnected from nature and the outdoors are complex. "Project Wild Thing isn't some misty-eyed nostalgia for the past. We need to make more space for wild time in children's daily routine, freeing this generation of kids to have the sort of experiences that many of us took for granted. "It's all about finding wildness on your doorstep and discovering the sights, sounds and smells of nature, whether in a back garden, local park or green space at the end of the road." The campaign, said to be the biggest ever aiming to reconnect children with the outdoors, includes the National Trust, the RSPB, Play England and the NHS, as well as playgroups, businesses and schools. </body>

      <title>Light shed on how genes shape face</title>
      <description>Scientists identify thousands of small regions of DNA that influence the way facial features develop.</description>

      <body>Scientists are starting to understand why one person's face can look so different from another's. Working on mice, researchers have identified thousands of small regions of DNA that influence the way facial features develop. The study also shows that tweaks to genetic material can subtly alter face shape. The findings, published in Science, could also help researchers to learn how facial birth defects arise. The researchers said that although the work was carried out on animals, the human face was likely to develop in the same way. Professor Axel Visel, from the Joint Genome Institute at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, told BBC News: "We're trying to find out how these instructions for building the human face are embedded in human DNA. "Somewhere in there there must be that blueprint that defines what our face looks like." The international team has found more than 4,000 "enhancers" in the mouse genome that appear to play a role in facial appearance. These short stretches of DNA act like switches, turning genes on and off. And for 200 of these, the researchers have identified how and where they work in developing mice. Prof Visel said: "In the mouse embryos we can see where exactly, as the face develops, this switch turns on the gene that it controls." The scientists also looked at what happened when three of these genetic switches were removed from mice. "These mice looked pretty normal, but it is really hard for humans to see differences in the face of mice," explained Prof Visel. "The way we can get around this is to use CT scans to study the shapes of the skulls of these mice. We take them and scan their heads. then we can measure the shape of the skull of these mice and we can do this in a very precise way." By comparing the transgenic mice with unmodified mice, the researchers found that the changes were very subtle. However some mice developed longer or shorter skulls, while others have wider or narrower faces. "What this really tells us is that this particular switch also plays a role in development of the skull and can affect what exactly the skull looks like," he explained. Understanding this could also help to reveal why and how things can go wrong as embryos develop in the womb, leading to facial birth defects. Prof Visel said: "There are many kinds of craniofacial birth defects; cleft of the lip and palate are the most common ones. "And they have severe implications for the kids that are affected. They affect feeding, speech, breathing, they can require extensive surgery and they have psychological implications." While some of these are caused by genetic mutations, the researchers want to understand how the genetic switches interact. Professor Visel added that scientists were just at the beginning of understanding the processes that shape the face, but their early results suggested it was an extremely complex process. He said it was unlikely in the near future that DNA could be used to predict someone's exact appearance, or that parents could alter genetic material to change the way a baby looks. </body>

      <title>Seven-planet solar system found</title>
      <description>Astronomers have discovered the seventh planet orbiting a distant star, which they describe as one of the richest planetary systems known to science.</description>

      <body>Astronomers may have identified one of the richest planetary systems yet. The discovery of a seventh planet around the dwarf star KIC 11442793 could be a record, according to two separate teams of researchers. The system bears some similarities to our own, but all seven planets orbit much closer to their host star, which lies some 2,500 light-years from Earth. The crowded solar system is described in two papers published on the pre-print server Arxiv.org. One of the identifications was made by volunteers using the Planet Hunters website. The site was set up to allow volunteers to sift through the public data from Nasa's Kepler space telescope - which was launched to search for so-called exoplanets - worlds orbiting distant stars. Kepler uses the transit method to discover new planets, which entails looking for the dip in light as an alien world passes in front of its host star. But there is simply too much data for mission scientists to examine every light curve, so they developed computer programmes to search for the signature of a planetary transit. "This is the first seven-planet system from Kepler, using a transiting search. We think [the identification] is very secure," said Chris Lintott, from the University of Oxford, co-author on the Planet Hunters paper. "With a transiting system, once you get multiple planets, the odds of them being false positives are very small." Dr Lintott's team has submitted their research to the Astronomical Journal for peer review. Another team of astronomers from several European countries has submitted a separate paper outlining their independent discovery of the seventh planet to the Astrophysical Journal. The new planet is the fifth furthest from its parent star, orbiting with a period of nearly 125 days. With a radius of 2.8 times that of the Earth, it fits into a family that now includes two roughly Earth sized worlds, three "super-Earths" and two larger bodies. "It actually looks like our Solar System in one sense, with all the small planets on the inside and the big planets on the outside. And that's not necessarily what we always see," said co-author Robert Simpson, also from Oxford University. While there might be resemblances to our Solar System, all seven planets are closer to their host star. In fact they would all fit within the Earth's distance from the Sun, making this a very crowded neighbourhood. "This is one of the reasons they are easy to see, because the closer they are to their sun, the more frequently they go around it," said Dr Simpson. However, the Planet Hunters team carried out simulations showing that the planetary system should be a stable one. Dr Lintott, who co-presents the BBC's Sky at Night programme and helped found Planet Hunters, added: "Everything we know about this system tells us [the seventh planet] should have been found using the automatic detection routines. But it wasn't." "A seven-planet system is very complicated so you get a sense of why the automatic routine might have missed out - it gets confused by the presence of the other transits. "Looking for these transits seems like a task that's perfectly designed for computers. But we keep finding, in these niche cases, in these odd cases, in these complicated cases that humans can beat the computers." Another star, HD 10180, has been claimed to have either seven, or nine planetary signals. A distant sun called GJ 887C may also have a family of seven planets. Commenting on the paper by the Planet Hunters team, Andrew Collier Cameron, professor of astronomy at the University of St Andrews, said: "It's intriguing that a system as well-studied as KOI-351 can still harbour hidden surprises that can only be winkled out by human eyes." He added: "This is a perennial problem in transit hunting, of which we are only too acutely aware in our own ground-based searches. "The best transit signal-detection algorithms developed to date still come a very poor second to the human visual system when it comes to pattern recognition. Still, we have to rely on machines, because of the sheer volume of data produced by enterprises like transit searches." Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter </body>

      <body>Archaeologists in Peru have found two mummies more than 1,000 years old in a suburb of the capital, Lima. The mummies - of an adult and a child - were found at an ancient religious complex which has been under excavation since 1981. The child is believed to have been an offering to the gods and may have been buried alive after the adult's death. Researchers also found other offerings including the remains of guinea pigs and jars with feline designs. "This is one of the most important finds in more than three decades of excavation, because the mummies are intact," researcher Gladys Paz told the AFP news agency. The mummies are squatting and are fully dressed wrapped in rope. It is the third intact find among more than 70 tombs uncovered in the Huaca Pucllana tomb, a pyramid-like temple built by the pre-Columbian Wari culture between 100 and 600 AD in what is now the Miraflores neighbourhood. In 2010, archaeologists found the remains of a woman with four children, and in 2008, the remains of a teenage girl. The site was built on 2.5 hectares of land and towers over 20m (66ft) high. So far, only about 40% has been excavated. The Wari culture flourished between AD 500 to 1,000 on the coastal area of northern Peru. Little is known about them, as they did not appear to leave a written record. </body>

      <body>National Trust director-general Dame Helen Ghosh says the conservation charity has an "open mind" about allowing fracking on its land. Her comments appear to contradict the Trust's position of a "presumption against" the controversial technology. Campaigners say the environmental risks of fracturing rock to release gas are too great. A spokesman says the Trust has not changed its position but will review any new evidence in the future. Fracking is the process of drilling down into shale rock before a high-pressure water mixture is directed at the rock to release the gas inside. Water, sand and chemicals are injected into the rock at high pressure which allows the gas to flow out to the head of the well. In an interview with The Times Newspaper, Dame Helen said: "We all have yet to see what the surface environmental impact of fracking is and when we have seen it we would reach a view." She added: "We are waiting for the evidence. We have an open mind." However, the Trust's position on fracking says: "We have a presumption against fracking on our land because natural gas is a fossil gas. "The mining process also gives rise to potential environmental and landscape impacts." It goes on to say: "Whilst the use of natural gas might buy time to develop secure, renewable alternative energy sources, it also risks distracting us from focusing on the development of these and on the need for us all to concentrate on using less energy in the first place. 'Fool's gold' A Trust spokesman said: "Our position is a presumption against fracking on our land. "It doesn't mean that in time that won't change - if the environmental and visual impacts are negligible and it is part of a strategy to move to a low carbon economy." The Trust adopted its position of a presumption against the gas/oil extraction technique during the summer's anti-fracking protests at Balcombe, West Sussex, where energy company Caudrilla planned to carry out test drilling. Earlier this year, the charity's director of conservation, Peter Nixon, described fracking as "fool's gold". He said: "If it takes our eyes off the ball from the need for energy efficiency and a long-term sustainable source of renewable energy, it will be fool's gold." The spokesman told BBC News: "Shale gas is a fossil fuel [that] may prove a fool's gold and distract attention from a shift to renewables. "The environmental and visual impacts are also unproven, and this is what concerns many people. We want to see more evidence on what this impact will be." </body>

      <title>Badger cull extension confirmed</title>
      <description>The pilot badger cull in west Gloucestershire is to be extended for a further eight weeks, Natural England confirms.</description>

      <body>The pilot badger cull in west Gloucestershire will continue for another eight weeks after a licence was granted, Natural England has confirmed. During the six-week period of the original licence, 708 badgers were killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Ministers and the NFU say culling badgers will curb TB in cattle, but protesters say it has little effect. A licence has already been granted to extend the Somerset cull to 1 November. Natural England said it had granted the extension after taking advice from Defra's chief veterinary officer and chief scientific adviser who said failure to extend would raise the risk of increasing the spread of TB by dispersing badgers. The new licence, which runs until 18 December, specifies that a minimum of 540 and a maximum of 940 badgers can be culled in order to control the disease. 'Badger cull madness' As the close season for cage trapping and shooting begins on 1 December, only controlled shooting will be permitted from 1-18 December. Animal welfare charity, Humane Society International (HSI) UK, said it was "appalled" to hear the extension had been granted. The charity said prolonging the shooting "is the very worst thing the government can do because it increases the risk of spreading bovine TB as badgers flee the area". Gloucestershire resident Mark Jones, who is executive director of HSI UK, said: "I am flabbergasted that an eight-week extension has been granted to Defra's badger killing fiasco in Gloucestershire. "By extending culls here as well as in Somerset, the pilots are moving even more dangerously away from the recommendations of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial which were very clear - the longer you subject badgers to this sort of disruption, the greater the risk of worsening the spread of bovine TB among both badgers and cattle. "Surely somebody in government can put a stop to Owen Paterson's badger cull madness before it's too late?" Badger Trust spokesman Jack Reedy said: "It goes against the advice that Defra gave to itself, that it should be a maximum of six weeks. "If they're not following their own terms of reference then that's something that is very actionable so we shall be going either for a judicial review or for an injunction." </body>

      <title>‘Most distant galaxy’ discovered</title>
      <description>An international team of astronomers has detected the most distant galaxy yet.</description>

      <body>An international team of astronomers has detected the most distant galaxy yet. The galaxy is about 30 billion light-years away and is helping scientists shed light on the period that immediately followed the Big Bang. It was found using the Hubble Space Telescope and its distance was then confirmed with the ground-based Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The study is published in the journal Nature. Because it takes light so long to travel from the outer edge of the Universe to us, the galaxy appears as it was 13.1 billion years ago (its distance from Earth of 30 billion light-years is because the Universe is expanding). Lead researcher Steven Finkelstein, from the University of Texas at Austin, US, said: "This is the most distant galaxy we've confirmed. We are seeing this galaxy as it was 700 million years after the Big Bang." The far-off galaxy goes by the catchy name of z8_GND_5296. Astronomers were able to measure how far it was from Earth by analysing its colour. Because the Universe is expanding and everything is moving away from us, light waves are stretched. This makes objects look redder than they actually are. Astronomers rate this apparent colour-change on a scale that is called redshift. They found that this galaxy has a redshift of 7.51, beating the previous record-holder, which had a redshift of 7.21. This makes it the most distant galaxy ever found. The system is small: about 1-2% the mass of the Milky Way and is rich in heavier elements. But it has a surprising feature: it is turning gas and dust into new stars at a remarkable rate, churning them out hundreds of times faster than our own galaxy can. It is the second far-flung galaxy known that has been found to have a high star-production rate. Prof Finkelstein said: "One very interesting way to learn about the Universe is to study these outliers and that tells us something about what sort of physical processes are dominating galaxy formation and galaxy evolution. "What was great about this galaxy is not only is it so distant, it is also pretty exceptional." He added that in the coming years, astronomers are likely to discover even more distant galaxies when Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is launched and other ground-based telescopes come online. Commenting on the research, Dr Marek Kukula, Public Astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, told BBC News: "This, along with some other evidence, shows that there are already quite surprisingly evolved galaxies in the very early Universe . "This high star-formation rate maybe is a clue as to why these galaxies can form so quickly." Prof Alfonso Aragon-Salamanca, from the University of Nottingham, added: "This is an important step forward, but we need to continue looking for more. "The further away we go, the closer we will get to discovering the very first stars that ever formed in the Universe. The next generation of telescopes will make this possible." But Dr Stephen Serjeant from the Open University said: "Chasing ultra-high redshift galaxies is a very exciting but equally very difficult game, and many claims of extremely distant galaxies have since turned out to be more nearby interlopers." </body>

      <title>Tree pest begins march from Moscow</title>
      <description>The emerald ash borer, a tree-killing beetle that has cost the US economy billions of dollars, could "spread unhindered" across Europe, a study warns.</description>

      <body>An invasive species of beetle that has killed tens of millions of ash trees in North America could "spread unhindered" across Europe, researchers have warned. The emerald ash borer, first recorded in the Moscow area in 2007, has become established in surrounding broadleaved woodlands, they observed. The pest, which is expected to cost the US economy $10bn, has spread up to 25 miles each year, the team estimated. The findings of the survey have been published in the journal Forestry. The team of two UK and two Russian scientists found that the emerald ash borer (EAB) population had spread 146 miles (235km) west of Moscow and 137 miles (220 km) south of the Russian capital city. In their paper, the team described EAB (Agrilus planipennis) as a "major threat to Fraxinus excelsior (European ash), and south of Moscow, where the beetle has become established in natural broadleaved woodlands in which F. excelsior is a major component, many of the ash trees are suffering severe dieback and mortality". They added: "The abundance and almost continuous distribution of F. excelsior in these woodlands means that A. planipennis now has the opportunity to spread unhindered on a broad front to other countries in Europe." Enemy within The beetle is native to north-east China, the Korean peninsula, Japan, Taiwan, Mongolia and the Russian Far East. The beetles' larvae feed on the surface layers of the wood of a tree, cutting off vital supplies of nutrients and water, causing branches and eventually the whole tree to die. Although the adult beetles only live for a matter of weeks, an individual female can lay in excess of 200 eggs during their short lives but the average is estimated to be in the region of 30-60 eggs. While native Asian ash trees appear to have co-evolved resistance to the EAB, US native ash species, such as the green ash (F. pennsylvanica) and white ash (F. americana) have no such resilience, resulting in devastating consequences. Since the first recorded case of an EAB infestation in Michigan back in 2002, the invasive alien species has spread rapidly through 19 US states and two Canadian provinces, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake. The researchers wrote: "The beetle has killed tens of millions of trees over the past 10 years and has raised concerns over the future of ash in North America. "The cost to the US economy over the 10-year period from 2009 to 2019 - in terms of tree removal and replacement alone - is expected to exceed $10bn." Whether a similar fate awaits European ash trees remained uncertain at this stage, explained co-author David Williams, an entomologist from Forest Research, the scientific arm of the UK Forestry Commission. During the summer, Dr Williams and colleague Dr Nigel Straw spent two weeks in and around Moscow to assess the impact and spread of EAB in the area. Dr Williams told BBC News that previous research suggested that an individual beetle would not fly more than six miles (10km) during its lifetime. Yet the team, in their assessment, found evidence that EAB was spreading by up to four times that distance. "There is evidence that the species is riding on vehicles, which is why it is moving long distances," Dr Williams observed. "If it is travelling long distances, it is dependent on a host tree being available for it to jump on to." "To the south of the city, European ash is a component of the natural woodlands. Now that it is established in these woodlands, it is difficult to judge how quickly it is likely to move." He added that it was difficult to quantify the size of the emerald ash borer population that had become established in the woodlands south of Moscow. "Trying to find signs and symptoms of EAB damage is unbelievably difficult in the early stages," Dr Williams explained. "It does seem to be from our observations that it [is] much harder to spot signs and symptoms of EAB damage in European ash than in North American species of ash. "So the fact that it has reached this almost continuous forest of ash into Europe through Belarus and Ukraine is going to [make it] difficult to track its movement." Touch wood The UK is more than 1,500 miles from Moscow, and the Forestry Commission predicts that it is likely to be "many years" before the pest reaches these shores under its own steam. However, a spokesman added: "Regulations are in place to minimise the risk of its accidental introduction in trade and transport, and we are assessing whether more needs to be done to further reduce these risks." He added that the UK and the EU were currently drafting Pest Risk Analyses on EAB. In addition, tree health experts were developing a contingency plan in case there was an EAB outbreak in the UK. The spokesman said that it would follow the same approach used to tackle an outbreak of Asian longhorned beetle in Kent in 2012. And there was a Europe-wide network, known as Fraxback, that allowed scientists across the continent to share their research and findings. Although its efforts were focused on tackling ash dieback, it could provide information that could be used in terms of slowing or halting the spread of EAB. Dr Williams said that during his time in the Russian woodlands, there were signs that some trees may have a degree of resistance to EAB infestations. "European ash is supposed to be much more closely related to Asian ash species than North American species, so that resistance that Asian ash species has to EAB could well be part of genetic make-up of European ash," he suggested. "There was certainly some evidence within Moscow itself. We did not find many European ash but when we did find them, half were looking perfectly healthy. "Perhaps more interestingly, when we moved south into the forests where European ash is much more common, there was a much higher degree of variability in the trees' canopy condition. "This is the opposite of what you find in North American species of ash. When it is attacked by EAB, the dieback is so obvious it is startling. He added: "This suggests that it is perhaps not as susceptible to the beetle as North American species." </body>

      <title>Trees reveal hidden gold deposits</title>
      <description>The detection of gold in tree leaves helps to locate deposits buried in the earth, Australian scientists find, and it could also apply to other metals.</description>

      <body>Money might not grow on trees, but scientists have confirmed that gold is found in the leaves of some plants. Researchers from Australia say that the presence of the particles in a eucalyptus tree's foliage indicates that deposits are buried many metres below. They believe that the discovery offers a new way to locate the sought-after metal in difficult-to-reach locations. The research is published in the journal Nature Communications. Dr Mel Lintern, a geochemist from Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), said: "We've found a lot of the easy deposits in Australia and elsewhere in the world as well. "Now we are trying to tackle finding these more difficult ones that are buried beneath tens of metres of river sediments and sand dunes. "And the trees are providing us with a method to be able to do this." Buried treasure Gold particles have been found around the soils of eucalyptus trees, but the researchers confirmed that the plants were taking in the element. Using the Australian synchrotron - a vast machine that uses X-rays to probe matter in remarkable detail - they found traces of gold in the leaves, twigs and bark of some trees. The amounts of the precious metal were tiny. "We've done a calculation, and found that we need 500 trees growing over a gold deposit to have enough gold in the trees themselves to make a gold ring," said Dr Lintern. However, the presence of the particles pointed to greater riches buried more than 30m (100ft) below. Dr Lintern said: "We believe that the trees are acting like a hydraulic pump. They are bringing life-giving water from their roots, and in so doing, they are taking smaller dissolved gold particles up through the vascular system into the foliage." Currently, the metal is found in outcrops, where the ore appears at the surface, or it is detected through exploratory drilling. But the researchers said that analysing vegetation could offer a better method to find untapped gold deposits. Dr Lintern said: "Not only do we believe it is a way of stretching the exploration dollar further, because exploring for these deposits can be quite expensive, it also minimises the damage to the environment because we are taking a very small sample from the trees themselves, as well as the leaves and twigs on the ground." The researchers said the technique could also be used to find other minerals such as iron, copper and lead in other parts of the world. </body>

      <title>Greenpeace piracy charges 'dropped'</title>
      <description>Greenpeace activists held in Russia over a protest against Arctic oil drilling face lesser charges of hooliganism rather than piracy, officials say.</description>

      <body>Russia has dropped piracy charges against 30 Greenpeace activists, replacing them with hooliganism charges, according to officials. The new charge has a maximum penalty of seven years rather than 15. Greenpeace says it is still "wildly disproportionate". Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise vessel was seized by Russian forces as activists tried to scale an offshore oil platform. All 30 people on board were detained. Two of them are freelance journalists. So far all bail applications in the case have been refused. Vladimir Markin, the head of Russia's main investigating agency the Investigative Committee, told Russian news agencies that the charges had been reclassified. But the investigators did not rule out more serious charges at a later date - in particular the use of violence against officials. The refusal of the detainees to give evidence also gives the authorities reason to consider other offences such as terrorism and espionage, Mr Markin said. Last week, 11 Nobel prize-winners wrote to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to drop the charges of piracy. The presidential press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said the president had no power to influence the courts. Mr Putin said last month that the activists had violated international law but it was "absolutely evident that they are, of course, not pirates". Vladimir Chuprov of Greenpeace Russia said that there was no case for either piracy or hooliganism charges. "The Arctic 30 are no more hooligans than they were pirates," he said in a statement. "This is still a wildly disproportionate charge that carries up to seven years in jail. It represents nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest." Earlier Greenpeace Russia programme director Ivan Blokov told the Interfax news agency he was surprised the Russian government had refused to attend international court hearings in Germany over the detentions. The Netherlands took the case of the Dutch-flagged ship and its crew to the UN tribunal in Hamburg on Monday. The Russian foreign ministry released a statement pointing out that Moscow had opted out of UN Law of the Sea dispute procedures, which infringe upon sovereignty, in 1997. All 30 people who were on board the ship are in pre-trial detention in the northern port city of Murmansk until late November. They have complained of being held in harsh conditions, They were detained when Russian security sources stormed the ship five weeks ago following a protest against drilling for oil in the Arctic. Greenpeace denies any wrongdoing and is calling for the release of the detainees, who come from 18 countries, and the Arctic Sunrise. </body>

      <title>Meteorite may solve Martian mystery</title>
      <description>A meteorite reveals clues to how Mars lost its thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere and became a cold, rocky desert, researchers say.</description>

      <body>A meteorite reveals clues to how Mars lost its thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere and became a cold, rocky desert, researchers say. They say the Lafayette meteorite shows signs of carbonation - where minerals absorb CO2 in a reaction with water. Mars lost its protective blanket about 4 billion years ago, perhaps because of the loss of its magnetic field, space impacts, or chemical processes. Carbonation may be the key factor, they write in Nature Communications. The process occurs naturally on Earth - and has been proposed as a technique for mitigating climate change, by capturing CO2 from the atmosphere. The 4.5cm Lafayette meteorite was discovered in Indiana, US in 1931, having plummeted to Earth about 3,000 years ago. It formed in the Red Planet's crust about 1.3 billion years ago, and was ejected from the surface by a massive impact. A team from the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC) performed microscopic analysis on a section of the rock - borrowed from the Natural History Museum in London. They found that silicate minerals, such as olivine and feldspar, had interacted with CO2-rich liquid water to form siderite crystals. The team says their discovery suggests liquid water was present on Mars more recently than some had thought. They also say it represents the first direct evidence for carbonation on the Red Planet - and ties in with the discovery of carbonates by Nasa's Curiosity Mars rover. "Carbonation could be the main force that turned Mars to stone," said lead author Dr Tim Tomkinson, of SUERC. "We can't say for certain it's the dominant cause - the loss of Mars' magnetic field may also have led to the stripping of its atmosphere by the solar wind. And CO2 is also frozen in the poles of Mars. "But carbonates do seem to be very abundant on the Martian surface." The loss of its carbon dioxide cloak is likely to have caused Mars to cool. So understanding how the CO2 was removed "could provide vital clues to how we can limit the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere and so reduce climate change" said Dr Tomkinson. Mineral carbonation is widespread on Earth. For example, in Oman's Samail mountains, weathering of peridotite rocks has been estimated to bind more than 10,000 tons of CO2 per year. Speeding up this natural process - by fracking rocks and pumping in purified CO2 - has been proposed as a technique for carbon capture and storage. "From our analysis of the meteorite, it seems that carbonation occurs in certain orientations - we see amazing saw-tooth edges, all lining up," Dr Tomkinson told BBC News. "It could be for example that if you wanted to frack rocks and introduce CO2 you should do it from a certain angle." Dr Caroline Smith, curator of meteorites at the Natural History Museum, said: "These findings show just how valuable meteorites from collections like those we have here really are. "There is so much important and useful scientific information locked away in these rare rocks. "Our study shows that as we learn more about our planetary next door neighbour, we are seeing more and more similarities with geological processes on Earth." </body>

      <body>A new colony of water voles has been captured on film using hidden cameras at a canal lock in Wiltshire. Ecologists from the Canal and River Trust spotted signs of the creatures during conservation works at the Caen Hill lock flight near Devizes. Laura Plenty, from the trust, said: "We decided it was a fantastic place to test our heat and motion sensitive camera to catch them in the act." The nationally-protected species is one of the UK's fastest declining mammals. Ms Plenty said the trust had been working to create the right habitat for the creatures in an attempt to reverse the decline in the water vole population. She said they knew there were some colonies on the canal near Devizes but had not been aware of this particular colony until the recent visit to Caen Hill Lock. She said they put the camera in place after "spotting a water vole latrine which is basically a big pile of droppings". "I couldn't believe it when we captured our first footage of the water vole," Ms Plenty said. "It clearly wasn't camera shy, as we managed to get further footage, with the vole even investigating the camera and knocking it over which happily lead to some fantastic shots of water voles hauling themselves out of the water. "Viewing the footage of the vole proves that this hard work has been worthwhile. "The fact that there's a new colony of voles living on the canal is the best reward we could ask for." Water voles like to live along canals and riverbanks so they can burrow to create complicated systems of underground tunnels and nesting chambers. A survey released by the Environment Agency and wildlife trusts in September, suggested that water voles had decreased by a fifth in the UK since 2011. Reasons for the declining population include habitat loss, predation by American mink and changeable weather. </body>

      <title>Women 'better multitaskers' than men</title>
      <description>It is not a myth - women really are better than men at multitasking and employers should bear this in mind, say the authors of a new study.</description>

      <body>It is not a myth - women really are better than men at multitasking, at least in certain cases, a study says. Men were slower and less organised than women when switching rapidly between tasks in tests by UK psychologists. Both sexes struggled to cope with juggling priorities, but men suffered more on average, according to the paper in the journal BMC Psychology. It says: "The question now is why? And is it all types of multitasking or only certain situations?" The researchers hope to encourage more research on a topic which they say has attracted "astonishingly few" studies - considering how often the "women vs men" debate crops up in conversation. If men really are slower than women, it could have serious implications for how workplaces are organised, says co-author Dr Gijsbert Stoet, of the University of Glasgow. "Multitasking is getting more and more important in the office - but it's very distracting, all these gadgets interrupting our workflow. "It could be that men suffer more from this constant switching," he told BBC News. Previous studies on gender and multitasking have drawn widely different conclusions. One experiment in China found that women outperformed their male counterparts, while another in Sweden found that men may actually be better than women at multitasking when spatial tasks are involved. To settle the argument, Dr Stoet and a colleague set out to compare women and men in a certain type of multitasking; the kind we use when faced with juggling many tasks in rapid succession - but not quite simultaneously. These might include office workers who jump between incoming emails, phone calls and assignments, while running in and out of meetings. Another example might be parents in the household - cooking a meal while looking after young children and suddenly having to answer the phone. First, they compared 120 women and 120 men in a computer test which involves switching between tasks involving counting and shape-recognition. Men and women were equal when tasks were tackled one at a time. But when the tasks were mixed up there was a clear difference. Both women and men slowed down, and made more mistakes, as the switching became more rapid. But the men were significantly slower - taking 77% longer to respond, whereas women took 69% longer. "This difference may seem small, but it adds up" over a working day or week, said Dr Stoet. To make the experiment more relevant to everyday life, the researchers tried a second test. A group of women and men were given eight minutes to complete a series of tasks - locating restaurants on a map, doing simple maths problems, answering a phone call, and deciding how they would search for a lost key in a field. Completing all these assignments in eight minutes was impossible - so it forced men and women to prioritise, organise their time, and keep calm under pressure. In the key search task in particular, women displayed a clear performance advantage over men, says co-author Prof Keith Laws, of the University of Hertfordshire. "You can see from the drawings - women used methodical search patterns, like going round the field in concentric rectangles. That's a highly productive strategy for finding a lost object. "Whereas some men didn't even search the whole field in any particular manner, which is just bizarre." The reason, he observed, was that women were more organised under pressure. "They spent more time thinking at the beginning, whereas men had a slight impulsiveness, they jumped in too quickly," said Prof Laws. "It suggests that - in a stressed and complex situation - women are more able to stop and think about what's going on in front of them." Altogether, they conclude that women "have an advantage over men" in multitasking, at least in certain situations. "This suggestion does rankle a bit with men," Prof Laws explained. "Men tell me this just doesn't ring true with their experience. They regale me with stories about how the greatest pilots in the RAF are men and they have to deal with lots of different incoming information all the time. "And of course there are men who are experts. We'd never claim that all men can't multitask, or that only women can. "But we'd argue the average woman is better able to organise her time and switch between tasks than the average man. "There's no point denying these differences exist." Psychologist Dr Dongning Ren of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said the study was a useful addition to the scientific debate. "In my own research, I found similar results, so this adds support for this conclusion," she told the BBC. "Still, it is possible that for certain tasks, men might be better at multitasking. It may depend on the nature of the tasks - sequential or simultaneous." In a world where people increasingly have to multitask, we need to help individuals adapt their roles to their abilities, said Prof Laws. "Of course I don't think we should just assign women to roles where rapid switching is demanded," he explained. Instead, employers should consider assessing individuals' ability in multitasking, as some firms already do. "Because the truth is - people don't seem to be very good at assessing themselves," Prof Laws told BBC News. "Studies show that men tend to think they're better at multitasking than they are in reality, and women tend to think they're worse than they really are. "I think I am great at it, but my wife thinks I'm not." If women really are better than men, the obvious question is why? It could be that what Dr Stoet and Prof Laws observed is a learning effect - where people become expert multitaskers by practice. But there are plenty of evolutionary theories too - such as the hunter-gatherer hypothesis. This invokes a rather traditional image of women at home, cooking and tending to the infants, with men out doing so-called "linear" tasks such as chasing and killing prey. "Put simply - if women couldn't multitask, we wouldn't be here," said Dr Stoet. And interestingly - compared to our closest relatives, the apes, we are all terrible at multitasking - men and women alike. If humans have "lost" this ability during evolution, it suggests that our simple, one-track minds could actually give us an advantage, Dr Stoet explained. "Filtering out distractions helps us to achieve things we couldn't otherwise do. Like making fire," he said, offering a grain of comfort to those who find themselves on the wrong side of the divide. </body>

      <title>Exoplanet tally soars above 1,000</title>
      <description>The number of observed exoplanets - those orbiting distant stars - passes 1,000 and of these, 12 might be habitable, scientists claim.</description>

      <body>The number of observed exoplanets - worlds circling distant stars - has passed 1,000. Of these, 12 could be habitable - orbiting at a distance where it is neither "too hot" nor "too cold" for water to be liquid on the surface. The planets are given away by tiny dips in light as they pass in front of their stars or through gravitational "tugs" on the star from an orbiting world. These new worlds are listed in the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia. The tally now stands at 1,010 new exoplanets, bolstered by 11 new finds from the UK's Wide Angle Search for Planets (Wasp). Abel Mendez of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico, said that although the number has rapidly increased in recent years, due to a lack of funding this figure is much lower than it could be. "We have more techniques and proven technology to detect more exoplanets, but the limit has been telescopes, especially space telescopes. "If we had more funding there would be more telescopes and that count would be much larger by now." The Kepler space telescope, which spotted many of these worlds in recent years, broke down earlier this year. Scientists still have to trawl through more than 3,500 other candidates from this mission so the number could rapidly increase. In January 2013, astronomers used Kepler's data to estimate that there could be at least 17 billion Earth-sized exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy. They said that one in six stars could host an Earth-sized planet in close orbit. The number of confirmed planets frequently increases because as scientists analyse the data they are able publish their results online immediately. But as the finds are not yet peer reviewed, the total figure remains subject to change. "Each night we get a list of astronomy papers where there might be an exoplanet announcement. When we get that we have to review it," explained Prof Mendez. This exoplanet catalogue is organised by Jean Schneider, an astronomer at the Paris Observatory. For the past 18 years he has catalogued new exoplanets on the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia. Others in the field, like Prof Mendez, are then able to review and comment on the findings, which makes it "more dynamic" he explained. "That's why the other catalogues just lag behind. The review is reliable as it's exactly the same as what the journals do." Prof Mendez told BBC News. Nasa will only accept those announced in an academic journal, so it updates its list far less frequently. Their tally currently stands at 919 confirmed worlds. Jean Schneider said it was also important to note that there was "no consensus for the definition of a planet" and that past experience had shown that a few objects declared as planets were actually artefacts or low-mass stars. "Some objects, like some Kepler planets, are declared 'confirmed planets' but have not been published in [referenced] articles. It does not mean that they will not be published later on, but it introduces another fuzziness in the tally," he added. Even if there was a generally adopted definition, Mr Schneider said that for some objects "there is a large uncertainty on parameters, so that the planetary nature of the object is uncertain". For Prof Mendez reaching 1,000 marks an important milestone in the quest to understand the history of the evolution of the cosmos. "I don't just want to know where the exoplanets are, I want to understand the stars, because they are the hosts for the planets. I want to understand the whole galaxy and the distribution of the stars because everything is connected," he explained. For him, the most exciting discoveries are Earth-like planets which could be habitable. "We want to know how unique our planet is, that's a big question and we are now closer than ever," he added. For Mr Schneider the most interesting is the candidate exoplanet around Alpha Centauri, as it is circling a star only four light-years away. This planet likely has the same mass as Earth but is outside the "habitable zone" as it circles its star far closer than Mercury orbits our Sun. </body>

      <title>Baldness cure a 'step closer'</title>
      <description>Scientists have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory.</description>

      <body>Scientists say they have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory. A joint UK and US team was able to create new hairs from tissue samples. Far more research is needed, but the group said its technique had the "potential to transform" the treatment of hair loss. The study results were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. There are baldness therapies including drugs to slow the loss of hairs, and transplants, which move hair from the back of the head to cover bald spots. The scientists at the University of Durham, in the UK, and Columbia University Medical Centre, in the US, were trying to actually grow new hairs. Their plan was to start with material taken from the base of a hair and use it to grow many new hairs. But human hair has been tricky to grow despite successes in animal studies. Whenever human tissue was taken from the dermal papillae, the cells which form the base of each hair follicle, the cells would transform into skin instead of growing new hairs. However, the group found that by clumping the cells together in "3D spheroids" they would keep their hairy identity. Tissue was taken from seven people and grown in 3D spheroids. These were then transplanted into human skin which had been grafted on to the backs of mice. After six weeks, new hair follicles formed in five out of the seven cases and some new tiny hairs began to form. Prof Colin Jahoda, from Durham University, told the BBC a cure for baldness was possible but it was too soon for men to be hanging up the toupee. "It's closer, but it's still some way away because in terms of what people want cosmetically they're looking for re-growth of hair that's the same shape, the same size, as long as before, the same angle. Some of these are almost engineering solutions. "Yeah I think it [baldness] will eventually be treatable, absolutely." He added: "It's hard to say exactly how long that would take, but the fact that we've done it now should reawaken interest." Any future therapy would involve transplanting cells which have been grown in the laboratory so safety is a concern. There would be a risk of infection and the cells could become abnormal, or even cancerous, while being grown. Baldness cures may not be the first application of the research. Prof Jahoda believes the findings will be used to improve the quality of skin grafts used after severe burns. Prof Angela Christiano, from Columbia University, said: "This approach has the potential to transform the medical treatment of hair loss. "Current hair-loss medications tend to slow the loss of hair follicles or potentially stimulate the growth of existing hairs, but they do not create new hair follicles. "Our method, in contrast, has the potential to actually grow new follicles using a patient's own cells." </body>

      <body>The US space agency has said it will allow Chinese scientists to attend an astronomy conference in California next month, reversing an earlier ban. Nasa put the earlier ban down to a misinterpretation of its policy on foreign nationals. Chinese officials had called the rejection of Chinese scientists' applications a form of discrimination. The event for scientists who research planets beyond the solar system will be held at Ames Research Center. The bar on Chinese scientists, revealed earlier this month, was prompted by new counter-espionage legislation restricting foreign nationals' access to Nasa facilities, Nasa spokesman Allard Beutel told the BBC. The conference will be attended by US and international researchers who work on Nasa's Kepler space telescope programme. The agency faced criticism from Chinese officials and US scientists who claimed Chinese students and researchers in their labs were being subjected to discrimination. In recent weeks, a growing number of US scientists decided to boycott the meeting in protest, with senior researchers withdrawing individually or pulling out their entire research groups. "The initial decision was based on a misinterpretation of the agency's policy regarding foreign nationals," Mr Beutel said. "We were able to clarify that interpretation and correct the decision, but it didn't happen until the federal government reopened last Thursday." Earlier this month the US government partially shut down operations for 16 days, putting hundreds of thousands of federal employees on leave. The counter-espionage legislation passed in March was part of a broad and aggressive move initiated by Congressman Frank Wolf, Republican chairman of the House of Representatives subcommittee that has jurisdiction over Nasa's budget. Mr Wolf later called Nasa's reading of the legislation "inaccurate" and sought to clarify the original intent of the law. "The congressional provision - which has been in place since early 2011 - primarily restricts bilateral, not multilateral, meetings and activities with the Communist Chinese government or Chinese-owned companies," Mr Wolf wrote in an 8 October letter to Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden. "It places no restrictions on activities involving individual Chinese nationals unless those nationals are acting as official representatives of the Chinese government," he wrote. </body>

      <title>UK first in heart failure operation</title>
      <description>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time.</description>

      <body>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time. Patients with heart failure struggle to pump blood around the body and mild exercise can leave them breathless. Surgeons used a form of "cardiac sewing" to remove scar tissue and reduce the size of the heart so it pumps more efficiently. The operation took place at King's College Hospital in London. One common cause of heart failure is when the arteries which nourish the organ become blocked, leading to a heart attack. Heart muscle dies and is replaced by hard scar tissue which does not beat. Over time, the scar tissue can stretch so chambers of the heart become larger, meaning the organ has more blood to force out with each heartbeat. The overall effect is a weaker heart, less able to do its job, transforming simple day-to-day tasks like climbing stairs into extreme exertions. In the operation, surgeons used a wire with anchors at both ends to pierce two sections of heart muscle. When the wire was tightened, the walls of the heart were "remodelled". The scar tissue was effectively removed and the volume of one of the chambers of the heart was reduced by a quarter. Sevket Gocer, 58 and from Bromley in south-east London, was the first patient to be treated in the UK. His heart function is said to have "improved significantly" after the operation. A similar procedure used to be performed by opening up the chest and stopping the heart, but it was a very risky operation and fell out of medical practice. Surgeons hope the less invasive operation, which can be performed while the heart is still pumping, will be a better option for patients. Mr Olaf Wendler, a professor of cardiac surgery at King's College Hospital, told the BBC: "In the technique we have now used for the first time in the UK, one does not need to stop the heart, one does not even necessarily need to place the patient on a heart-lung machine. "It's a less traumatic and less invasive type of procedure." He said the operation was being tested in a trial at hospitals across Europe and that the procedure could make a difference to patients' lives. He said: "[If successful] it's bringing them on to an exercise level where they're able to look after themselves properly including going to do the shopping and having a social life." Prof Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: "The results of this trial will determine if this experimental procedure is safe. "If the trial is successful, there will be further use of the technology as surgeons gain expertise in the technique. As more people are treated with this procedure, it will become fully clear whether it will have a real benefit for patients." </body>

      <title>'Electronic blood' computer tested</title>
      <description>A new brain-inspired computing device powered via a liquid instead of through wires has been demonstrated at IBM's Zurich laboratory.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24571219</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70552000/jpg/_70552415_8549310302_50612fbc36_c.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>IBM has unveiled a prototype of a new brain-inspired computer powered by what it calls "electronic blood". The firm says it is learning from nature by building computers fuelled and cooled by a liquid, like our minds. The human brain packs phenomenal computing power into a tiny space and uses only 20 watts of energy - an efficiency IBM is keen to match. Its new "redox flow" system pumps an electrolyte "blood" through a computer, carrying power in and taking heat out. A very basic model was demonstrated this week at the technology giant's Zurich lab by Dr Patrick Ruch and Dr Bruno Michel. Their vision is that by 2060, a one petaflop computer that would fill half a football field today, will fit on your desktop. "We want to fit a supercomputer inside a sugarcube. To do that, we need a paradigm shift in electronics - we need to be motivated by our brain," says Michel. "The human brain is 10,000 times more dense and efficient than any computer today. "That's possible because it uses only one - extremely efficient - network of capillaries and blood vessels to transport heat and energy - all at the same time." IBM's brainiest computer to date is Watson, which famously trounced two champions of the US TV quiz show Jeopardy. The victory was hailed as a landmark for cognitive computing - machine had surpassed man. But the contest was unfair, says Michel. The brains of Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter ran on only 20 watts of energy, whereas Watson needed 85,000 watts. Energy efficiency - not raw computing power - is the guiding principle for the next generation of computer chips, IBM believes. Our current 2D silicon chips, which for half a century have doubled in power through Moore's Law, are approaching a physical limit where they cannot shrink further without overheating. "The computer industry uses $30bn of energy and throws it out of the window. We're creating hot air for $30bn," says Michel. "Ninety-nine per cent of a computer's volume is devoted to cooling and powering. Only 1% is used to process information. And we think we've built a good computer?" "The brain uses 40% of its volume for functional performance - and only 10% for energy and cooling." Michel's vision is for a new "bionic" computing architecture, inspired by one of the laws of nature - allometric scaling - where an animal's metabolic power increases with its body size. An elephant, for example, weighs as much as a million mice. But it consumes 30 times less energy, and can perform a task even a million mice cannot accomplish. The same principle holds true in computing, says Michel, whose bionic vision has three core design features. The first is 3D architecture, with chips stacked high, and memory storage units interwoven with processors. "It's the difference between a low-rise building, where everything is spread out flat, and a high rise building. You shorten the connection distances," says Matthias Kaiserswerth, director of IBM Zurich. But there is a very good reason today's chips are gridiron pancakes - exposure to the air is critical to dissipate the intense heat generated by ever-smaller transistors. Piling chips on top of one another locks this heat inside - a major roadblock to 3D computing. IBM's solution is integrated liquid cooling - where chips are interlayered with tiny water pipes. The art of liquid cooling has been demonstrated by Aquasar and put to work inside the German supercomputer SuperMUC which - perversely - harnesses warm water to cool its circuits. SuperMUC consumes 40% less electricity as a result. But for IBM to truly match the marvels of the brain, there is a third evolutionary step it must achieve - simultaneous liquid fuelling and cooling. Just as blood gives sugar in one hand and takes heat with another, IBM is looking for a fluid that can multitask. Vanadium is the best performer in their current laboratory test system - a type of redox flow unit - similar to a simple battery. First a liquid - the electrolyte - is charged via electrodes, then pumped into the computer, where it discharges energy to the chip. Redox flow is far from a new technology, and neither is it especially complex. But IBM is the first to stake its chips on this "electronic blood" as the food of future computers - and will attempt to optimise it over the coming decades to achieve zettascale computing. "To power a zettascale computer today would take more electricity than is produced in the entire world," says Michel. He is confident that the design hurdles in his bionic model can be surmounted - not least that a whole additional unit is needed to charge the liquid. And while other labs are betting on spintronics, quantum computing, or photonics to take us beyond silicon, the Zurich team believes the real answer lies right behind our eyes. "Just as computers help us understand our brains, if we understand our brains we'll make better computers," says director Matthias Kaiserswerth. He would like to see a future Watson win Jeopardy on a level playing field. Other experts in computing agree that IBM's 3D principles are sound. But as to whether bionic computing will be the breakthrough technology, the jury is out. "The idea of using a fluid to both power and cool strikes me as very novel engineering - killing two birds with one stone," says Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey's computing department. "But every form of future computing has its champions - whether it be quantum computing, DNA computing or neuromorphic computing. "There is a long way to go from the lab to having one of these sitting under your desk." Prof Steve Furber, leader of the SpiNNaker project agrees that "going into the third dimension" has more to offer than continually shrinking transistors. "The big issue with 3D computing is getting the heat out - and liquid cooling could be very effective if integrated into 3D systems as proposed here," he told the BBC. "But all of the above will not get electronics down to the energy-efficiency of the brain. "That will require many more changes, including a move to analogue computation instead of digital. "It will also involve breakthroughs in new non-Turing models of computation, for example based on an understanding of how the brain processes information." </body>

      <body>A study on a Jersey site that revealed a significant piece of late Neanderthal history has been published. Scientists working on an archaeological dig in St Brelade said teeth found at La Cotte suggest Jersey was one of the last places Neanderthals lived. The team of British archaeologists have unearthed items which show the presence of Stone Age hunters at the headland. They said the finds were helping scientists understand more about the early relatives of modern humans. A large portion of the site contains sediments dating to the last Ice Age, preserving 250,000 years of climate change and archaeological evidence. The site, which has produced more Neanderthal stone tools than the rest of the British Isles put together, contains the only known late Neanderthal remains from North West Europe. Dr Matt Pope of the Institute of Archaeology at University College London, who helped lead the research, said: "In terms of the volume of sediment, archaeological richness and depth of time, there is nothing else like it known in the British Isles. "Given that we thought these deposits had been removed entirely by previous researchers, finding that so much still remains is as exciting as discovering a new site." The team dated sediments at the site using a technique called optically stimulated luminesce, which measures the last time sand grains were exposed to sunlight. Dr Pope said the results showed that part of the sequence of sediments dates between 100,000 and 47,000 years old, indicating that Neanderthal teeth which were discovered at the site in 1910 were younger than previously thought, and "probably belonged to one of the last Neanderthals to live in the region". Professor Clive Gamble, from the University of Southampton and archaeology member of the Natural Environment Research Council, said: "Archaeologists need dates like an artist needs paint. Without a sound chronology the power of our other techniques for probing the past are severely restricted. "This is a great step forward on what looks like being a fascinating journey." The wider project, supported also by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the Jersey Government, will continue to investigate the site and material excavated from it over the past 110 years. </body>

      <body>Experts have found the first venomous crustacean - a centipede-like creature that lives in underwater caves. The blind "remipede" liquefies its prey with a compound similar to that found in a rattlesnake's fangs. It lives in underwater caves of the Caribbean, Canary Islands and Western Australia, feeding on other crustaceans. The venom contains a complex cocktail of toxins, including enzymes and a paralysing agent. The findings are detailed in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution. The remipede (Speleonectes tulumensis) breaks down body tissues with its venom and then sucks out a liquid meal from its prey's exoskeleton. Co-author Dr Ronald Jenner, a zoologist at London's Natural History Museum said: "The unique insights from this study really help improve our understanding of the evolution of animal venoms. "The spider-like feeding technique of the remipede is unique among crustaceans. This venom is clearly a great adaptation for these blind cave-dwellers that live in nutrient-poor underwater caves." Crustaceans are a large group of the wider category of animals known as arthropods. They include shrimp, krill, lobsters and crabs. Most are aquatic, but a few - such as woodlice - live on land. Dr Bjoern von Reumont, also from the Natural History Museum commented: "This is the first time we have seen venom being used in crustaceans and the study adds a new major animal group to the roster of known venomous animals. "Venoms are especially common in three of the four major groups of arthropods, such as insects. Crustaceans, however, are a glaring exception to the rule. "While they can be as varied as tiny waterfleas, krill, crabs and barnacles, not one of the approximately 70,000 described species of crustaceans was known, until now, to be venomous." </body>

      <body>A school has been forced to close because of an outbreak of Britain's most venomous spider. The Dean Academy, in the Forest of Dean, said it "had identified an issue with false widow spiders" in its ICT block and other areas of the site. A letter from vice-principal Craig Burns to parents said the school would be shut on Wednesday to be fumigated. Conservationists believe a change in the climate could be the cause of an increase in sightings of the species. In the letter, Mr Burns said the school had taken immediate pest control advice on discovery of the spiders. Initially the decision was taken to close the ICT block but further discoveries of the species elsewhere have led to a full school closure. "This will enable pest control to fumigate every area in the academy and ensure everyone's health and safety," Mr Burns wrote. "There have been no reports of anyone being bitten by the false widow spiders at the academy but if you have any concerns please seek medical advice." The school is expected to be open as normal on Thursday. The false widow (Steatoda nobilis) is about the size of a 50p coin and is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known in Britain. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Symptoms can include severe swelling, chest pains and tingling of fingers, with the severity depending on the amount of venom injected. Gloucestershire spider recorder David Haigh said people would have to be "very unlucky" to be bitten by one as they do not move very quickly and are not aggressive. He said he has never heard of a school being closed due to spiders, but said recent media attention on the False Widow has led to greater awareness. </body>

      <description>A passionate concern over the world that children will inherit sees the head of the UN's climate body break down in tears.</description>

      <body>The head of the UN body tasked with delivering a global climate treaty broke down in tears at a meeting in London as she spoke about the impact of global warming on coming generations. Christiana Figueres told the BBC that the lack of an agreement was "condemning future generations before they are even born". Ms Figueres said this was "completely unfair and immoral". Despite the slow pace of negotiations, she said a deal can be done by 2015. Costa Rica-born Christiana Figueres has been the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for the last three years. Taking over after the failure of the talks process in Copenhagen in 2009, Ms Figueres has carefully steered the parties forward. Delegates agreed in Durban in 2011 that a new global deal must be signed by 2015 and come into force from 2020. But Ms Figueres' passionate approach to progress has been tested by the slow, tortuous UN process, where consensus is the only way forward. "I am always frustrated by the pace of the negotiations, I was born impatient. We are moving way, way too slowly, but we are moving in the right direction and that's what gives me courage and hope," she said. Speaking to the BBC on the sidelines of a climate conference at Chatham House in London, Ms Figueres became tearful when she reflected on the impact that climate change might have on coming generations. "I'm committed to climate change because of future generations, it is not about us, right? We're out of here," she said. "I just feel that it is so completely unfair and immoral what we are doing to future generations, we are condemning them before they are even born." "We have a choice about it, that's the point, we have a choice. If it were inevitable then so be it, but we have a choice to change the future we are going to give our children." She said that she was hopeful an agreement could be signed in Paris in 2015 but if that was going to happen, then significant progress had to be made in the next 12 months. There would need to be the draft text of an agreement when the parties meet in Peru in 2014. She said she was determined to avoid the mistakes that were made in the run up to Copenhagen in 2009, when expectations of a far reaching global compact faltered. "We are not going to have another Copenhagen - the leaders of the world are not just being brought in at the last minute, to face 300 pages of text that is completely impossible to digest. Next year would see a special climate summit of world leaders called by UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon. Ms Figueres is hopeful that this will clear the road ahead of the Paris meeting in 2015. "It is not going to be in Paris, going into all the technical details of how to build the agreement which is what we had in Copenhagen. The structure and logic of an agreement need to be in place. "This is way too complex and way too challenging to wait until the last minute in 2015." This year's Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC will take place next month in Poland. Some environmental campaigners are concerned that because of the country's heavy dependence on coal, it is less committed to strong action on climate change. Critics took issue with comments on an official website for the conference that suggested there were many positives to the unprecedented melting of Arctic ice, including the opportunity to chase "pirates, terrorists and ecologists". But Ms Figueres dismissed concerns about the meeting. "They have shown themselves to be very committed to this process, the COP president (Polish environment minister Marcin Korolec) has put in an extraordinary amount of time into learning and making himself familiar with the endless intricacies of this issue," she said.

      <title>Badger group disruption aids TB flow</title>
      <description>Badgers with TB spread the infection more easily to other badgers and to cattle when social groups are disturbed, a new study confirms.</description>

      <body>Badgers with TB spread the infection more easily to other badgers and to cattle when social groups are disturbed, a new study confirms. Vaccination has the potential to reduce the spread of infection without disturbing local populations, scientists report in Current Biology. The findings help explain why culling badgers can cause TB infection in cattle to rise, as infected badgers roam into new territory, they say. Pilot culls are underway in England. Badgers are being culled in west Somerset; with a decision due shortly on whether to extend a pilot cull in west Gloucestershire. In the study, researchers at the University of Exeter and the National Wildlife Management Centre at Woodchester Park, Gloucestershire, fitted 51 badgers in eight different social groups with electronic collars. They monitored the range of the wild badgers and their social interactions over the course of a year. The researchers were able to build a detailed picture of the social network of a wild population of badgers for the first time. We think of badgers as living in tight knit social groups and "sleeping in a big heap underground", but there is more complexity to it, said Prof Robbie McDonald of the University of Exeter, who led the study. "What our study shows is that social structure is very important for the transmission of infection in wild badgers," he told BBC News. "It also suggests that social stability is a good way of mitigating disease spread. So if you can intervene in a system and maintain social stability that's likely to be the best of both worlds." Vaccination does not disrupt social structure, he said, suggesting the social network in badgers - where relatively few individuals might be responsible for disease spread - lends itself to vaccination and could lead quite rapidly to herd immunity. "If you are trying to control disease, it may be advantageous not to disrupt social structure and so you could disrupt flow through those sorts of individuals by using vaccination," Prof McDonald added. "But of course vaccination doesn't do any good to an animal that's already infected." A 9-year trial found that culling badgers could reduce infection in cattle by 12-16% (after four years of culling and five years of follow-up). But if too few badgers are killed over too long a time period, TB infections in cattle can rise as badgers roam further afield to establish new social groups. Prof Rosie Woodroffe of the Institute of Zoology, London, said the study provided clarity about how badgers' social behaviour helps to constrain the spread of TB. "Genetic studies in the Randomised Badger Culling Trial found that culling increased badgers' movements, with especially marked increases for infected badgers," she said. "This new study helps to understand how such behavioural changes could prompt the major increases in disease prevalence which we saw as a result of culling. "The authors are right to highlight that their work shows how the benefits of badger vaccination are likely to be enhanced by badgers' social behaviour, because badger social networks are small and local, so vaccinating small numbers of badgers could still have benefits at a local scale. In contrast, culling disrupts badger social behaviour and spreads disease across the landscape." The Welsh government has chosen to vaccinate badgers in an effort to control TB in cattle, while the government policy in England is to cull badgers in high TB areas. Around 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in 2012 at a cost of £100m to taxpayers. Ministers and the NFU say culling is needed to fight bovine TB, but animal welfare and wildlife groups say scientific evidence does not support the policy of shooting badgers in an attempt to control the disease. </body>

      <title>Worldwide ban on bird pollutant</title>
      <description>A pollutant that killed thousands of birds off the coast of Britain earlier this year can no longer be dumped at sea after a worldwide ban was agreed.</description>

      <body>A pollutant that killed thousands of birds off the coast of Britain earlier this year will no longer be dumped at sea after a worldwide ban was agreed. More than 4,000 birds were killed or injured by the chemical polyisobutene (PIB) between Cornwall and Sussex, and on the Channel Islands. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has reclassified PIBs from 2014. It means ships will only be able to wash their tanks and dispose of all PIB residues while in port. Until now it has been legal for discharges to be made when vessels wash out their tanks, as long as they are further than 12 nautical miles from the nearest point of land. The ban had been recommended by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), on behalf of the government, and was welcomed by the RSPB, RSPCA and other wildlife charities. The decision was taken by the IMO at a meeting in London on Monday. "There was only one entry for PIBs before," said the IMO's Natasha Brown. "We are keeping the current category but will create a new entry for the high viscosity PIB, which is the problem chemical if you like, in terms of these discharges." The substance - a lubricant used to improve the engine performance of ships - was found on seabirds, mainly guillemots, in two separate instances between January and May. In the sea, high viscosity PIB becomes "glue-like", covering birds and restricting their movements and ability to feed, causing them to eventually die from hypothermia or starvation. In August, the MCA said it had been unable to trace the vessel the contamination spill had come from and closed its investigation. Adam Grogan, RSPCA senior wildlife scientist, said: "Our staff worked around the clock washing and treating these poor birds in January and April and it was heartbreaking seeing the pitiful state they were in. "Hopefully this will help stop incidents like these happening again, and save wildlife from suffering and dying like this in the future." Alec Taylor, from RSPB, said wildlife charities worked hard for the ban, with support from several south coast MPs. "But the huge support we received from members of the public, many of whom experienced the effects of this pollution first hand as they walked the beaches, was perhaps the clinching factor in achieving such a quick decision to prevent discharges of harmful PIBs," he added. The IMO is the United Nations agency responsible for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships. It consists of 170 member states, of which the UK is one. The organisation confirmed a number of other European countries had also been investigating the discharge of "high viscosity products" by chemical tankers, including PIBs. </body>

      <title>Dung beetle has galloping gait</title>
      <description>Three species of desert dung beetle move with a newly discovered "galloping gait", rather than walking like other insects, scientists say.</description>

      <body>Scientists have discovered that three species of dung beetle walk with a "galloping" gait not seen in any other insect. The vast majority of insect species walk with what is known as an alternating tripod gait - steadily moving forward three legs at a time. It is not clear why these flightless beetles have shifted so radically from the usual way of walking. The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology. The researchers wrote: "Like a bounding hare, the beetles propel their body forward by synchronously stepping with both middle legs and then both front legs." The beetles appeared simply to "drag" their back legs, they added. Dr Jochen Smolka, from the University of Lund in Sweden, who carried out the research in South Africa, was studying wingless desert dung beetles in order to find out how they navigated to their burrows. "We noticed that [one species we were looking at] was kind of bobbing along in a peculiar manner," he told BBC News. "At first we thought that maybe there was something wrong with it - that maybe it had some damage to its hind legs. "And then we noticed that all of the beetles of that species move like that most of the time." The researchers used high-speed camera to film the beetles' motion in detail. They then carried out tests in the lab, tracing the exact movement of the insects' legs as they walked across sandpaper. If the group of species the team was studying, known as Pachysoma, they found three species to have this same unusual gait. Dr Bill Sellers, who studies biomechanics at the University of Manchester, described the findings as "very peculiar". He explained that almost all of about one million insect species that have been described to science walk with the classic tripod gait. "They form a triangle with their legs," he explained. "So they have the left-front, right-middle and left-back legs on down at once, and then the opposite ones." "It's a very easy gait to control, and we know it's quite efficient." "So it's difficult to see why these beetles do what they do - it's a real puzzle." Dr Smolka and his colleagues carried out miniature time trials in their lab to see if this beetle was able to move any faster than beetles that walked normally. "But it turned out that the normally walking insects were up to 50% faster," he said. "What we're going to look at in the future is if it has something to do with their navigation." Their latest studies have suggested that the galloping beetles are able to stabilise their vision better when they are on slippery surfaces. "So it could be that if you're moving really fast [in a tripod gait], your head just moves from side to side so much that vision could be blurred," Dr Smolka explained. "Whereas in the galloping beetles, vision is always stabilised towards the front." </body>

      <body>A zoo's two new kittens could have a future role in a project to breed Scottish wildcats in captivity for possible release into the wild. Ness and Einich were born at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland's (RZSS) Highland Wildlife Park at Kincraig, near Aviemore. RZSS and the Aspinall Foundation are leading the plans for a conservation breeding programme. The wildlife park will be among the project's main breeding sites. RZSS said Ness and Einich may play a part in the programme, which is part of the wider Scottish Wildcat Conservation Action Plan unveiled last month and involves Scottish Natural Heritage. The cats are endangered in the wild. Breeding with feral cats, disease, habitat loss and fatal collisions with road traffic have caused a dramatic decline in their numbers. Only a few hundred pure-bred Scottish wildcats are thought to survive. Douglas Richardson, head of living collections at the Highland Wildlife Park, said the new kittens were the latest breeding success for the park. He said: "But with the wildcat action plan, the contribution that these little chaps may make in the future to their species' survival will hopefully be more impactful. "The plan is for a much more aggressively managed breeding programme, running alongside a wide range of other wildcat conservation initiatives that will eventually turn the tide for the species in Scotland." </body>

      <title>Monkeys 'take turns in conversation'</title>
      <description>Marmosets engage in what appears to be "polite conversation", taking it in turns to vocalise, according to researchers.</description>

      <body>Marmoset monkeys take it in turns to "talk" in a pattern very similar to human conversation, according to scientists. Researchers recorded the sounds of the marmosets as they called to one another from behind a curtain. Each animal would call, then wait for the other to respond before calling again. The results suggest an "alternative evolutionary route" for our own conversational turn-taking. They are reported in the journal Current Biology. It is something we take for granted in our conversations, but taking it in turns to talk and listen is crucial for us to effectively exchange information through what we say. Somewhat mysteriously though, we do not see an obvious origin in our closest primate relatives - the chimpanzees. Chimps are not very vocal and tend to use their repertoire of gestures to communicate, so it is widely accepted that these manual gestures provided the foundations for the co-operation inherent in our own communication. But Dr Asif Ghazanfar from Princeton University set out to look for evidence of a vocal route for this co-operation, by looking at vocal exchanges in marmosets. He explained that he chose marmosets precisely because, unlike chimps, they are very vocal. It is one of two main characteristics the monkeys share with humans, Dr Ghazanfar said. "They're [also] co-operative breeders - so they help one another take care of their offspring. "That's an important characteristic because it leads to greater pro-sociality (meaning the animals, like us, carry out behaviours that are intended to benefit others)." The lead researcher, Daniel Takahashi, recorded marmosets calling to one another from opposite corners of a room. The animals were separated by a curtain, so each could hear but not see the other. The recordings revealed that the marmosets would wait for about five seconds after the other finished calling to respond - seemingly following "unspoken rules of conversational etiquette". Dr Ghazanfar explained that there were two ideas for why the animals followed these rules. "One is, if you're out of sight of your group members and want to establish contact with another, you only know if you've established that contact if their response is contingent on your own," he explained to BBC News. "And the other hypothesis is that these calls they exchange might have information content [that needs to be digested]." Dr Ghazanfar says that our own conversational turn-taking might have evolved via a similar route - although on a parallel branch of the evolutionary tree. This provides an alternative explanation to the somewhat "mysterious step" it is suggested occurred as the patterns in chimp-like gestural exchanges evolved into the patterns of our own vocal communication. The team hopes that continued study of the marmosets will help to reveal more about why our own conversation can sometimes break down. "We are currently exploring how very early life experiences in marmosets - including those in the womb and through to parent-infant vocal interactions - can illuminate what goes awry in human communication disorders," said Dr Ghazanfar. </body>

      <body>Scientists have discovered that three species of dung beetle walk with a "galloping" gait not seen in any other insect. The vast majority of insects species walk with what is known as an alternating tripod gait - steadily moving forward three legs at a time. It is not clear why these flightless beetles have shifted so radically from the usual way of walking. The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology. Describing this strange gait in their paper, the researchers wrote: "Like a bounding hare, the beetles propel their body forward by synchronously stepping with both middle legs and then both front legs." Here Dr Jochen Smolka from the University of Lund in Sweden, describes the findings. </body>

      <title>The area of outstanding beauty remade by man</title>
      <description>Should our woodlands be managed or left entirely in the hands of nature?</description>

      <body>A year after the first case of ash dieback in mature woodland - and with the disease spreading inexorably - experts are looking at ways to future-proof forests. Stroll around the Woodland Trust's Hucking estate (pictured in satellite views, above) near Maidstone in Kent and you could be forgiven for thinking little has changed in centuries. Sheep graze on the swathes of grassland between the gentle chalk hills. Pockets of ancient woodland carpet the hilltops and valleys. In reality, however, this seemingly timeless rural landscape is in constant flux and the effects of ash dieback will soon be all too apparent. Trees on the estate show the hallmarks of the disease in the black, shrivelled leaves hanging from the branches of diminutive seedlings and the magnificent ash trees that tower above. Ash dieback is spreading fast in this Area of Outstanding Beauty known as the Kent Downs, with trees bearing the scars of the chalara fungus. "See that lovely big ash up there," says site manager Clive Steward, pointing out a huge tree in a patch of ancient woodland. "Underneath it - see the big wide leaves - that's sycamore. It's just waiting to take over really. Because that's what will happen." Nature is poised to fill in the gaps if - as experts predict - millions of native ash trees die. Britain's forests have been through much turmoil in modern times, from the harvesting of timber for the shipbuilding industry to the arrival of pathogens such as Dutch elm disease in the 1970s. But the current speed of change is alarming ecologists. They say trees are facing unprecedented threats, with a recent increase in findings of new pests and diseases. Many believe it is only a matter of time before threats such as the emerald ash borer beetle, which drills into the trunks of ash trees, reach our shores. In an age of global trade and travel, rather than trying to stop these invaders, the key to safeguarding forests could be to closely manage them - and plant them to be resilient to future threats, be they a new pest, a violent storm, or climate change. Austin Brady of woodland conservation charity the Woodland Trust says to give a wood resilience a range of native species need to be planted, so if a pathogen strikes, at least some of the trees will survive. "For future healthy forests we need forests to have a wider range of native species growing there, so that all our eggs aren't in one basket," says Mr Brady. "So that if a particular pest and disease or issue comes along it won't destroy the whole forest. It might take out some of the components but there'll be enough different species of trees in there for the forest to survive." Maintaining diversity in the age of trees is also important, he says, as is maintaining connections between woods to give wildlife the space to thrive. The Hucking estate is seen as a pioneer of the idea of resilient woodland. A few decades ago, before the estate was taken over by the Woodland Trust, much of it was arable farmland, dotted with patches of ancient woodland. Careful management and planning has restored the natural landscape, with new trees planted to create corridors of habitat for animals and birds to roam. A mixture of native trees were used, which stand a better chance of withstanding tree diseases that are moving around the world. Mr Brady sees the practice as trying to "mimic nature". But some believe management in this way is artificial, and that nature will find its own level. Naturalist and writer Richard Mabey argues catastrophes like tree diseases are natural events, from which woods will recover without intervention. "Woody vegetation responds, adapts, regroups," he wrote in the New Statesmen. "What emerges in its recovery stage may not be the same as before, but it will always be a vital, dynamic, arboreal community. The same process will happen with ash, perhaps more quickly than we think." Joan Weber of Forest Research, agrees that "nature will fill in the gaps," as it did when elms disappeared, but this is more difficult when one particular species is dominant in a woodland. Austin Brady, however, says Britain's countryside has lost the great, untamed forests still present in countries such as Poland, with a corresponding loss of diversity. "You could make an argument for saying, let's leave forests to nature," he says. "The trouble is - we stopped leaving forests to nature in this country about 2,000 years ago. So we can't suddenly now say let's leave them to nature... we've taken away all the support systems that nature would have had in place." Others question exactly what resilience means. Managing a wood land to guard against the effects of tree diseases will not necessarily help other wildlife in the area, says Ray Dawes of the National Trust . "If you are going to change the tree species you are going to change the wildlife," says Mr Dawes, who believes the prescription for a healthy woodland varies. The National Trust has 400 properties with significant amounts of woodland in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and they are all different. "It's looking at individual woods - their origins, their values and the threats to them," he says. Back at the Hucking estate, Clive Steward spreads out an ordnance survey map over the bonnet of his dusty estate car to point out lanes in the Sussex and Kent weald that were carved by ancient farmers running pigs through the forests. Ash trees have left their mark on the map, recorded in names like Ashford and Asholt Wood. Local conservationists are preparing to record the impact of the ash tree on the landscape from a cultural perspective, in case it is lost. Nick Johannsen, director of the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, grew up during the era of Dutch elm disease, and remembers it well. "It's going to be a longer, slower, more lingering loss than elm was," he says. "But already beautiful ash trees are a shadow of themselves." Ash has long been part of our heritage, he says, used for the framework of early aircraft such as the De Havilland Mosquito, and tennis racquets at Wimbledon. "Not only is it extraordinary in its landscape and its wildlife importance - its natural heritage - it's also part of the cultural heritage of Britain. That's what we want to celebrate - because we are losing ash trees." </body>

      <body>Long before the Metro, the steam trains of Petite Ceinture ("Little Belt" in English) connected Paris's main railway stations carrying people around the city along the path of its ancient walls. The circular line went into gradual decline from the 1930s, when competition arrived in the form of the more modern underground Metro system. For 32km (almost 20 miles) the tracks of Petite Ceinture snake through bustling Paris, isolated and largely unseen from street level in deep trenches, long tunnels, and bridges. Nature has reclaimed the space and it has become a haven for wild flowers and animals. The line is officially off-limits to the public, but this hasn't stopped many people attempting to explore it. There is now a fierce debate in the French capital about what to do with the tracks and stations of the Petite Ceinture that still remain. A small section opened as a park in August 2013 and the mayoral elections offer competing plans for cycle routes and parks. Associations set up to preserve the space would prefer to see the line reopened for pedestrian services. BBC News joined Thomas Jorion - a photographer who has been documenting the line since 1996 - on a tour of what he calls the last great wasteland in Paris.

      <title>Could Concorde ever fly again?</title>
      <description>Could Concorde ever take to the skies again?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24629451</url>
      <date>1382615025</date>

      <body>Ten years ago today, our ever-shrinking world got a little bit bigger again. Three Concordes landed in a procession at Heathrow airport, while thousands of emotional fans looked on. After 27 years, the world's most famous plane had been pensioned off - first by Air France and then by British Airways - marking the end of supersonic passenger flight. So how is it that a noisy, polluting lump of aluminium, that was too pricey for most people to ride in, is still so popular? "It was probably more advanced than Apollo 11, which put the first men on the Moon." Jock Lowe is not only Concorde's longest-serving pilot, he's a former president of the Royal Aeronautical Society. "No military plane came anywhere close. It was so manoeuvrable and there was so much spare power, even ex-fighter pilots weren't used to it." Jock can't keep the joy out of his voice as he tells me what Concorde was like to fly. "The time we took it to the Toronto International Airshow, 750,000 people turned out to watch. I'll never forget that sight." He is modest about it, but Jock is part of an elite club. There are more US astronauts than there are Concorde pilots. Jock then recalled the time he was chatting to some pilots of the super-secret American spy plane, the SR71 Blackbird. Now, the whole point of that amazing aircraft was that it flew way beyond the reach of other planes. Faster and higher, hidden away. But one day, these guys said that their air traffic controller told them to get out of the way because there was a Concorde coming through. They couldn't believe it. Peering out of one window, two American military pilots wearing spacesuits. Peering out of the other, perhaps Joan Collins guzzling champagne - I'm guessing she was on the plane as she often was. I wonder if they waved? Technically, Concorde was revolutionary. It was the first aircraft to have computer-controlled engine air intakes. This may not sound much but it was one of the most significant leaps in aviation technology at the time. In any technology, in fact. It meant that they could slow the air down by 1,000mph in the space of about 15ft (4.5m). Without that, the engines would have blown apart. Concorde had carbon-fibre brakes. Again, the norm now, but back in the 1960s a technological marvel - and it was fly-by-wire decades before Airbus made that a mainstream technology. A decade on, there is still a lot of anger at the way Concorde was retired, with British Airways and Airbus, which was responsible for spares and maintenance, both often accused of pulling the plug too soon. Almost as soon as the final flights touched down, a campaign was launched to get her airborne again. And it is still going strong. The Save Concorde Group (SCG) wants British Airways to either help fund a heritage flight, or release an aircraft to someone else who will. BA still owns eight Concordes, which remain scattered in museums across the globe, from Barbados to Manchester. "The only real reason for Concorde's retirement was politics, and that remains the single obstacle in the way of her return to the skies," says Ben Lord from the SCG. He told me that he is certain he can get a Concorde flying again for £20m ($32m) and he reckons Sir Richard Branson would still help him out with the money. "I still have a wonderful desk model of the plane in full Virgin Atlantic livery," says Sir Richard in his latest blog. "But despite offering £1m for each aircraft (they were originally sold to BA by the British government for £1) sadly our friends at British Airways were having none of it - and decommissioned the planes in a way that makes any chance of them flying again an unlikely prospect!" Talking of money, let's scotch that myth that the great gas-guzzler did not make any cash for British Airways. Going back to Jock Lowe, he told me that up until that horrendous crash at Paris in 2000, she made a net average profit of about £30m a year. That is £500m net profit over her lifetime. And Jock insists that in her final few months before retirement, she was still making money. Still, he does not think Concorde will ever get airborne again. And when I spoke to British Airways the answer was the same as it has always been. No chance. "We firmly believe that the technical and safety challenges of returning a Concorde to the skies are absolutely prohibitive," says BA. So will we ever see her like again? Well, the world's two dominant planemakers, Airbus and Boeing, certainly do not plan to build something supersonic any time soon. But there other options on the horizon. Sir Richard Branson's space plane Virgin Galactic is due to take its first paying passengers next year and he is promising that within his lifetime, they will be able to fly people from London to Sydney in two and a half hours with minimal impact on the environment. One final thought. I asked Jock Lowe if they ever did aerobatics when they were testing Concorde. He said they did execute barrel rolls, but never a loop-the-loop, although the aeroplane was more than capable of doing it. Doubtless it would have spilled some champagne. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Green taxes</title>
      <description>What are they and how do they affect our bills?</description>

      <body>The past few months have been dominated by a debate over energy prices, with all the political parties coming up with ideas to try to bring them down. The prime minister has announced a review into how the government's climate change policies - so-called green levies or taxes - affect bills and whether they are delivering value for money. But what exactly are these green taxes and how do they affect our bills? UK household dual fuel - electricity and gas - energy bills in 2013 are estimated to be about £1,267, based on average levels of energy consumption. What is that made up of? The chart below shows what the Department of Energy and Climate Change says makes up (in % terms) the average household energy bill. So green energy measures make up 9% of that cost, or £112. The average price of gas and electricity paid by UK households has risen by about 18% and 9% in real terms since 2010 and by about 41% and 20% in real terms since 2007. The chart below shows all of the climate change policies that in some way increase energy bills. So people talk about green levies, but there are in fact lots of different things introduced over the past decade and a half. Some cost people money, some save people money and some do both for different groups of people. It wouldn't therefore be easy to repeal all of them at all (many, like the Green Deal are halfway through their operation and would presumably cost more to get rid of it in the short term than it would to keep longer term). Well, the government says that by 2020 the cumulative impact of their measures will save the average household some 11%. The graph below shows all of the policies and how much they will add or take away from a household bill. So with all those things taken together the Department for Energy and Climate Change say that this is what their effect will be on household bills: So far so good, the policies are saving households' money. But if we look at the effect the policy has on retail prices (rather than bills) - how much each household pays for every unit of energy it consumes - we have a very different picture. Impact of levies on Retail Prices (% change from baseline) On that picture households will be paying 41% more for their electricity bills as a result of green policies than the retail price is expected to be. How is that circle squared? Well, it comes down to government's projections that: So although the retail price will be higher as a result of green measures we'll also use less energy thanks to them. Moreover even if we take the initial figure of 11%, nearly half of that actually comes from changes to boiler regulations all the way back in 2002. If those are removed, then the other measures in place save much less - only about 6%. So if the government has got it sums wrong on how much energy insulation will save, householders could find themselves with a rather big headache in the years to come. The impact of green measures is more considerable on business than for householders. Businesses that are medium-sized users of energy currently face energy (gas plus electricity) costs that are on average between 15% and 21% higher as a result of policies. By 2020 the impact is estimated to be between 23% and 26%. Policies are estimated to be adding between 1% and 14% to energy bills for high-energy users in 2013 and between 6% and 37% in 2020. The range depends on their electricity/gas mix. The government has put several measures in place to compensate the most intensive users so as to try to prevent them from becoming uncompetitive in world markets. </body>

      <description>How dangerous is the false widow spider?</description>

      <body>A school has been closed because of a venomous false widow spider, and experts say they are on the increase. But how much of a threat do they really pose? Sightings of Steatoda nobilis, the false widow spider, are on the rise. It is being cited as Britain's most venomous spider, and it is spreading. But experts say the species is not usually aggressive towards humans and that being bitten is rare. The species is becoming more common and more widespread, says John Tweddle from the life sciences department at the Natural History Museum, London. He says that "it's not an influx as such, rather that existing populations are expanding". And being bitten by one is not very common, explains Dr Tweddle. It's much less common than a bee or a wasp sting. "There have been very few confirmed incidences of bites from Steatoda nobilis, although adult female false widow spiders are certainly capable of biting humans if handled without due care - the smaller males are not known to cause bites. "It is not an aggressive species towards humans and is most likely to bite when accidentally prodded or squashed, or trapped in clothing." The false widow is believed to have arrived in Britain in crates of fruit from the Canary Islands in the late 19th Century, with the first reported sighting in Torquay in 1879. The species has most likely spread as a response to a changing climate, adds Dr Tweddle. "We're expecting the species to continue to increase its distribution within the UK. We tend to spot spiders most frequently during the Autumn as this is when many of the UK's larger species reach maximum size, so are most visible." The symptoms of a bite range from feelings of numbness, severe swelling and discomfort, to various levels of burning or chest pains. The severity of the symptoms depends on the amount of venom that was injected. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Although a bite is very uncomfortable, it's no stronger than a wasp sting, says Mark Champion from the Wildlife Trust. There is also a greater chance of dying from a wasp or bee sting, he adds. "The bite that it gives is mainly defensive, so it's not coming out to get you, it's not a horror movie," he told BBC Breakfast.. "The swelling can become the size of a tennis ball. It can be something quite big but it's not something we all need to panic about." A footballer was recently bitten by a false widow in his sleep had to undergo surgery to cut away the area around the bite. One newspaper has also reported that a man was left fighting for his life after a bite on his foot. Sara Goodacre from the University of Nottingham's Spider Lab, says there seems to be a "disproportionate worry" about the creatures and that such media reports are "scaremongering". False Widows are extremely prevalent in France and Spain, yet there are rarely reports of holiday makers being bitten, Dr Goodacre told BBC News. Furthermore, she adds, some of the media reports of the bites are not consistent with the effect a neurotoxin - present in a false widow's venom - would have. Responding to the footballer surgery, Dr Goodacre says: "That's what you would need to do with a venom that's slowly breaking down the tissue, which some snake and spider venoms do - but not the false widow. "People aren't always reporting the same consistent symptoms. It's important to work out if we are talking about the same thing, or whether it's an allergy where the symptoms depends on the person that's bitten. "This [false widow's] neurotoxin doesn't seem to do that. At best it's very unclear, at worst it's scaremongering." The bottom line, Dr Goodacre says, is that the false widow spiders should not be a problem as they are not aggressive. "Some people are clearly having a reaction to something so the question is what is it? If there is a problem we should investigate it further." According to the British Arachnological Society, false widows might occasionally be the subjects of mistaken identify. "It is difficult to obtain accurate evidence as those complaining of bites often do not see the spider but assume they are the culprit because of the absence of a bee or wasp," said the society. "Alternatively, they only get a brief glimpse. Rarely is the spider captured so that an accurate identification can be carried out." </body>

      <title>When an operating theatre becomes a lab</title>
      <description>Why research is key to better surgery</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24388537</url>

      <body>Scientific research takes place in a lab, doesn't it? Well, not when the developments are in surgery. Then it takes place in the clinics, wards and even the operating theatre. In this week's Scrubbing Up, Prof Dion Morton, director of research at the Royal College of Surgeons, says it is crucial that patients understand how important the work is - and that they take part. When people think about clinical trials their first thought might be of laboratories where pharmaceutical companies test the safety and effectiveness of drugs and vaccines. But in surgery too, clinical trials are a vitally important way of assessing the benefits new treatments bring to patients. Research and clinical trials are a daily part of the NHS, with many studies carried out by doctors and healthcare professionals who treat patients on a daily basis. Although 98% of people in the UK will need surgery at some point in their lives, less than 5% of government funding for medical research goes on improving surgery and developing new techniques. Surgery has been referred to as the 'Cinderella' of medical research, although funding has been slowly improving in recent years. From treating acute trauma to replacing joints after chronic disease, surgery has a broad impact and still cures more cancers than any other form of treatment. It is a vital part of the health service and investment in research is crucial if we are to be at the forefront of improving patient care. This is why new surgical clinical trial centres have been set up across the country. Surgeons are currently recruiting patients to assess new surgical techniques and determine which procedures give patients the best chance of making a full recovery. Each centre will focus on many different types of surgery including transplantation, heart and orthopaedic. Trials are challenging to design and it can be difficult to recruit patients, but with careful planning and good communication they are made possible. I am working on an international study which aims to find out at what point patients with late stage bowel cancer should be given chemotherapy. Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK and patients currently have to have surgery first to remove the cancer and then have chemotherapy. However, when the disease is advanced, all too often the cancer returns in the months or years that follow. This trial will look at whether patients who are given some chemotherapy prior to surgery are less likely to see their cancer return in the two years after treatment. In Bristol, colleagues are running a trial to compare the effectiveness of two common operations to treat severe obesity - gastric band and gastric bypass. During the course of the trial doctors will study over 700 patients, of which half will have been fitted with a gastric band and half will have had a bypass. Over three years they will compare how much weight patients' lose, whether they experience any complications following surgery and to what extent their quality of life improves following the operation. Obesity is a rapidly increasing global health problem which costs the NHS billions of pounds. Surgery is both a clinically-effective and cost-effective way of treating this disease and so the results of this trial will help the NHS decide which of these two treatments they should offer to patients. Surgical research has the potential to make real improvements in the way we care and treat patients. Patient safety and innovation go hand in hand as it is the evidence gained from these trials that will ultimately lead to reduced patient mortality and sickness. Despite limited investment, surgeons are striving to develop the evidence for new techniques and procedures that can change the face of hospital care. Raising standards, delivering new surgical treatments to patients and delivering them safely nationwide is central to a high quality health service. </body>

But over the past decade or so, a new threat has emerged - a silent, insidious one - canine distemper virus. Worldwide there are an estimated 400-500 Siberian or Amur tigers. Exact numbers are hard to determine because this is a reclusive animal that is rarely observed. Yet, at the turn of the century, some of these otherwise withdrawn animals were seen wandering onto roads and into villages in the Russian Far East. They were fearless and docile, confused and dazed; the antithesis of their usual ferocious and wary demeanour. Over the next few years evidence mounted that this, the largest living felid, was suffering from an infectious agent and the indications - the nature of the illness, historical understanding of wild cat infections and the diagnosis, in a single wild tiger, of a virus belonging to the morbillivirus genus - provided a likely culprit. A study published in the journal mBio, confirmed these suspicions. Genetic analysis of several dead tiger samples showed that canine distemper virus was the cause. Canine distemper virus (CDV), a relative of the human measles virus, was first described in dogs and infection causes fatal pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). But this virus is incredibly promiscuous and can infect jump into a variety of different animals - usually with catastrophic effects. Two suspected CDV outbreaks, the first in 1988 and a second in 2000, killed thousands of Baikal then Caspian seals. The virus has also ripped through Africa, with fatal outbreaks in silver-backed jackals and bat-eared foxes and catastrophic die-offs in wild dog populations that continue to this day. For years, cats were thought resistant to CDV. Yes, domestic cats could be infected in the laboratory, but this was inefficient and the virus was unable to pass from one animal to another. A massive demise in 1994 of African lions living in the Serengeti national park in Tanzania showed that this was fallacy. This population of closely monitored lions succumbed to CDV. Whilst only 34 lion deaths were documented during the outbreak, this was only the tip of the iceberg. Before CDV struck, the lion population numbered 3,000, but afterwards this had fallen by a third. In the same outbreak, countless hyenas, bat-eared foxes and leopards also perished. Add to this the recent report of infection of large numbers of South American jaguar and it is evident that this virus has little, if any respect for the so-called species barrier - the unique inherent host factors and properties that prevent viruses from jumping from one species to another. In an intriguing turn of events, CDV was also starting to spark fatal outbreaks in various primates. So what should we make of the emergence of CDV infection in primates. Is this an indication of the potential for a more compelling species jump? Could CDV do the unthinkable and infect humans? The simple answer is a resounding yes. At least, in theory it is. To replicate, a virus has to get into a host cell. It does this through interactions between proteins on its surface with proteins - receptors - on the surface of the cell. These receptors act as gateways into the cell and if the virus protein fits then infection takes place. Different animals possess slightly different versions of these receptors on their cells so the virus proteins also have to change to be able to unlock them. A single mutation in one of surface proteins in CDV present in primates is all it takes for the virus to successfully use the human receptor. This is a tiny species barrier. But before banishing the pet dog to a high containment kennel then donning personal protective clothing before you go near, there's a key part of the story we need to consider - one that's probably been protecting us for all of these years. When you're exposed to a virus your body recognises it as foreign and your blood cells generate antibodies which bind to the virus surface proteins and protect us from infection. It's the basis for vaccination. Fortunately, the surface protein of the measles virus is so similar to CDV that antibodies generated by the measles vaccine also protect against CD; and other morbilliviruses too. But, if we ever eradicate measles and stop vaccination, maybe then we will be susceptible to CDV. But what of the Amur tiger - will CDV ensure its ultimate demise? As Dr Denise McAloose, lead author on the mBio paper, explained: "When you're talking about four to five hundred animals and your losing reproductive females and their offspring, the overall impact on populations is huge. "Some of the earlier modelling work, if it were to pan out, does suggest that this is a significant disease even at the levels of disease we are detecting now, which is probably just the tip of the iceberg." A bleak outlook that is shared by a University of Nottingham colleague, veterinary virologist Dr Rachael Tarlinton: "Because they are such tiny populations even relatively small mortality events can seriously harm their genetic diversity and this might just be enough to push them over the edge." Hopefully it's not too late. We know that CDV vaccines work and a targeted vaccination programme might just pull Amur tigers back from the brink. Current CDV vaccines have to be injected - no trivial task when the animal you want to protect is so difficult to track down and so dangerous to handle. But not all vaccines need to be injected - some very effective vaccines have been developed for oral delivery and these have been pivotal in our fight against rabies. In the late 1970s, Switzerland pioneered the widespread deployment of enticing baits laced with rabies vaccine that would be eaten by rabies-susceptible wild animals, thereby protecting them. So successful was this approach that following a similar campaign that spanned more than two decades, Germany was declared rabies-free. Whilst development of an oral vaccine is scientifically feasible, it is unlikely ever to become a reality. As Dr Tarlinton explains: "It was worth developing the oral bait vaccines for rabies because of the human zoonosis risk, but something for a purely veterinary disorder, particularly one that infects wildlife rather than livestock? It's difficult to justify the economics of doing it, even if we should." Even though vaccinating tigers is unfeasible there is an alternative: identify the reservoir and remove the virus at source through vaccination campaigns. This has proven very effective in protecting CDV-threatened lion populations in Africa. But do we know what the reservoir is? Domestic dogs have been implicated in all epidemics involving wildlife but, because the virus can infect other animals, you have to be sure. And this is what Dr McAloose and her colleagues have turned their attention to. "We have to understand if there's a reservoir. "We're trying to identify how the virus is cycling through the system to understand what the carriers are, and only with these results would we be able to make the appropriate recommendations." For the sake of the Amur tigers, I wish them well in their quest. </body>

      <title>India Mars launch stokes space race</title>
      <description>India's mission to Mars set to stoke fires of new Asian space race</description>

      <body>The forthcoming launch of a spacecraft to Mars by India is likely to stoke the fires of a burgeoning Asian space race. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is making its final preparations to send an orbiter to the Red Planet. The principal aim is to test out India's space technology to see if this emerging space-faring nation is capable of interplanetary missions. The spacecraft will also collect scientific information about the planet's atmosphere and surface. The Mangalyaan probe was to have been launched as early as 28 October, but rough weather in the Pacific forced officials to delay the launch by a week. The unmanned mission has a launch window lasting until 19 November. If the mission succeeds, ISRO will become only the fourth space agency, after those in the US, Europe and Russia to have successfully sent a spacecraft to Mars. According to Pallava Bagla, science editor of New Delhi television news and author of a book about India's space efforts, Destination Moon, the country's public are especially excited about the possibility of beating China to the Red Planet. "If India does beat China to Mars you can imagine the national pride," he told BBC News. The mission was announced in August last year by India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during his independence day speech, delivered from the ramparts of one of New Delhi's most iconic buildings - the Red Fort. "Anything said from the ramparts of the Red Fort is always replete with national pride and national pride is written very largely and boldly on this mission," according to Mr Bagla. In 2011, a Chinese attempt to send a spacecraft named Yinghou-1 to Mars was aborted because of a technical problem. The Indian space agency then fast-tracked its Mars mission, called Mangalyaan, readying it in just 15 months. India has had a space programme for more than 30 years. Until recently, its priority has been to develop technologies that would directly help its poor population, such as improving its telecommunications infrastructure and environmental monitoring with satellites. But in 2008, ISRO translated its formidable capability to build and launch satellites toward exploration and send a probe to the Moon, Chandrayaan-1. The lunar mission cost more than £55m. Now the government has spent a further £60m to go to Mars. Some have questioned the government's shift away from building infrastructure towards exploration, and wonder whether the money could have been better spent. It is a point that draws this robust response from Mr Bagla: "You can't bring the 400 million people who live in poverty in India out of poverty with this £60 million," he says. The shift towards exploration is also a hard-headed one by officials in the hope that it will have clear economic benefits, according to Prof Andrew Coates, who rejoices in the impressive title of "Head of the Solar System" at the Mullard Space Sciences Laboratory in Surrey, part of University College London. "The exploration programme gives them something very high to aim for. If they can show the world they have what it takes to send spacecraft to other planets they can begin to sell launches and space on its launch vehicles to scientific organisations. It also brings India to the table of international space science exploration," Prof Coates explained. Developing satellites and developing launchers is now big business. If India, or for that matter China, ease up on their investments in space exploration there is a risk that they could lose out, not least on the vital expertise that this cutting edge endeavour brings to their respective countries. Sandeep Chachra, executive director of the poverty eradication charity Action Aid in India believes that investment in space exploration could potentially benefit the country's poorest. "Investing in new technology, including space technology is an important part of the aspirations for an economy such as India. Developing a sophisticated technological base in a country with this level of poverty is not a simplistic contradiction " he told BBC News. "What is important is to harness the advances that science and technology bring for the greater good and to use those advances to overcome ingrained poverty and build hope for future generations". China though remains the greater power in space. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has a well developed astronaut programme and an orbiting laboratory called Tiangong-1. The CNSA is planning to send its Chang'e-3 spacecraft and accompanying rover to the Moon in December. The mission is part of an ambitious plan to send more robotic probes to the Moon with a view to eventually sending astronauts to the lunar surface. The Japanese Space Agency (Jaxa) is also a major force in the region. It is by far the most experienced Asian space agency, with numerous unmanned scientific interplanetary missions under its belt. "India, China and Japan are certainly eyeing each other up," says Prof Coates. The growing rivalry is likely to see a new boom in space exploration - one that will eventually lead to more collaborative missions between the emerging space-faring nations in Asia. That might eventually lead to a truly global effort to send astronauts to Mars. Follow Pallab on Twitter </body>

      <title>Grangemouth plant to stay open</title>
      <description>The Grangemouth petrochemical plant near Falkirk is to stay open after a new deal was struck with workers.</description>

      <body>Political leaders and unions have welcomed news that the Grangemouth petrochemical plant is to stay open after a deal was struck with workers. Operator Ineos had announced on Wednesday that the plant was to shut, with the loss of 800 jobs, after union members rejected a survival plan. But the decision was reversed after the union agreed to Ineos's conditions. Ineos founder and chairman Jim Ratcliffe said it was "a victory for common sense". He confirmed Ineos would now press ahead with plans to invest £300m in a new gas terminal at the site, following a "significant change in attitude" from the Unite union. He added: "We have had assurances from the union yesterday that the changes we have requested in order for us to invest in that facility have been agreed and we are delighted to announce that Grangemouth will restart today, both the refining and petrochemicals side." The announcement on Grangemouth's future was greeted by huge cheers from the workforce, who had gathered at the plant to be told the news. The move brings to an end a bitter dispute with the Unite union which began over the alleged mistreatment of a Unite official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but Ineos shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a survival plan, which was initially rejected by union members. Reacting to the announcement, Unite Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said: "Relief will ring right round the Grangemouth community, and across Scotland today. "Hundreds of jobs that would have been lost can now be saved and £300m will be invested into the plant." The main points of the Ineos announcement included: First Minister Alex Salmond described the development as a "tremendous fillip for the workforce and the whole Grangemouth community, following what could have been a potential disaster". He said it had been "a great team effort from all concerned", including the unions and workforce, the management and governments. "I am delighted that people have rallied round to protect these jobs, and now we can all agree that Grangemouth has an outstanding future," he added. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael also welcomed the announcement, saying that it was "the news that we all wanted". "The staff and their families have been through a very stressful and uncertain time," he added. The announcement came as BP said it had reached an agreement with Ineos which would ensure that oil and gas supplies from the Forties Pipeline System would be secured. The pipeline - which brings oil and gas ashore from more than 50 North Sea fields - as well as BP's processing plant at Kinneil depend on steam and power from Grangemouth. BP said "some key commercial terms" had been adjusted in an existing deal with Ineos, but did not elaborate. It added: "By doing this, we have ensured that over a third of the North Sea's total oil and gas supplies will be unaffected, and that our motorist and airline customers will enjoy supply security." Ineos' future plans at Grangemouth include investing £300m in a new gas terminal at the site. Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean said: "It is a huge investment and that investment was only rightly to be done if we had a long-term sustainable base. "What we have now done is given the chemicals business another 15 to 20 years on the back of new raw materials, new contracts and significant investment." Mr MacLean would not dismiss the prospect of redundancies, but said they would be "very limited". The company has also said that 2,000 contractors it laid off after shutting down the complex would be re-hired to support investment in its survival plan. According to Ineos, the Scottish government has indicated it would support its application for a £9m grant to help finance its gas terminal plans, while the UK government has given "pre-qualification approval" for a £125m loan guarantee facility. Falkirk Council, which had planned to set up a task force to respond to the threatened closure, said the Ineos announcement was "the best possible outcome for all concerned". Council leader Craig Martin added: "There has been a tremendous effort behind the scenes to secure the plant's future involving UK and Scottish governments and Falkirk Council, working together to ensure the plant's survival. "This partnership approach has paid off and a more stable and positive future for the workforce has been delivered." </body>

      <body>Jack Straw is to stand down as MP for Blackburn at the next general election. The former Labour home and foreign secretary 67, was elected in Blackburn in 1979 and has stood in eight general elections in the constituency. He said his "love affair" with the town was "not going to end on 7 May 2015, nor is my connection with it." Labour leader Ed Miliband paid tribute to Mr Straw's "eloquence and wisdom" and said he "will continue to serve our country in many different ways". Mr Straw said: "Whatever national position I have held, the citizens of this town, and their children, have always been my first priority. "I am deeply grateful to everyone in the town for the faith which has been placed in me." But he said he had made the decision to stand down after a great deal of thought and consultation with friends and family. He added he "couldn't go on forever" and it would be "a terrible wrench" to stand down. Mr Straw held the positions of home secretary, foreign secretary and leader of the House of Commons under Tony Blair. Gordon Brown made him justice secretary in June 2007, a position he held until Labour's defeat at the 2010 election. Mr Miliband said: "Jack Straw will be greatly missed from the House of Commons. "On behalf of the Labour Party, I want to thank him for his nearly 35 years service as an MP, his achievements in government and his eloquence and wisdom. "He is Labour through and through, and always displayed this in his words and deeds. "He will be sorely missed but I know he will continue to serve our country in many different ways." Mr Straw practised as a criminal barrister before entering the Commons and was an adviser to Labour minister Barbara Castle, his predecessor as Blackburn MP. </body>

      <title>Mosque bomber given life for murder</title>
      <description>Ukrainian student Pavlo Lapshyn is jailed for at least 40 years for murdering an 82-year-old man and carrying out a series of mosque bombings.</description>

      <body>A Ukrainian student has been jailed for at least 40 years for murdering an 82-year-old man and plotting explosions near mosques in racist attacks. Pavlo Lapshyn stabbed Mohammed Saleem in Small Heath, Birmingham on 29 April, five days after arriving in the UK. On Monday, Lapshyn, 25, admitted murder as well as plotting to cause explosions near mosques in Walsall, Tipton and Wolverhampton in June and July. At the Old Bailey, he was told he would be jailed for life. Mr Saleem was stabbed to death, just yards from his home, after attending prayers at his local mosque in Green Lane. Lapshyn, from Dnipropetrovsk in Ukraine, was living in Birmingham while on a temporary work placement in the city when he killed Mr Saleem, a grandfather of 22. He later planted three bombs near mosques in the West Midlands as part of a campaign he said was motivated by racial hatred. He was arrested almost a week after an explosion in Tipton. The third device, which exploded near the Kanzul Iman mosque in Tipton on 12 July, was packed with nails. Police said it was only because Lapshyn got the wrong time for Friday prayers that the blast did not cause mass injuries. Sentencing, Mr Justice Sweeney told him: "You clearly hold extremist right-wing, white supremacist views and you were motivated to commit the offences by religious and racial hatred in the hope that you would ignite racial conflict and cause Muslims to leave the area where you were living. "Such views, hatred and motivations have no place whatsoever in our multi-faith and multi-cultural society." He added Lapshyn held "views abhorrent to all right-thinking people which have no place in our multi-cultural society". During interviews, Lapshyn told police he had murdered the grandfather of 22 because he hated "non-whites". Prosecutor Peter Wright QC told the Old Bailey that PhD student Lapshyn had come to the UK on a work placement with software company Delcam. The firm's sponsorship programme in partnership with the National Metallurgy Academy in Ukraine is now under review following his crimes. Lapshyn's apartment, above Delcam's offices in Birmingham, were raided by police who found chemicals and bomb-making equipment for another three devices. They also discovered a camera containing 455 photographs and 98 videos. Some of them showed Lapshyn detonating homemade bombs in the Ukrainian countryside. The camera also included shots of him making bombs. The force's anti-terrorism unit also discovered apparent anonymous notes in the apartment which he planned to use to taunt police. One featured a photograph of the hunting knife, next to which Lapshyn had written "Mohammed Saleem was killed by". He also referred to a police reward for information, saying "£10,000 small price, maybe £1m", followed by a smiley face, and the phrase "white power". The court heard Lapshyn had a video game on his laptop called Ethnic Cleansing and also posed for white a supremacist website with the knife. Defending, Richard Atkins QC said "we accept that his crimes are grave" and "the appropriate penalty we submit is life with a substantial minimum term". Mr Atkins told the court that Lapshyn is being kept in segregation and that the only person he speaks to regularly is his father. In an interview with the BBC, Lapshyn's father, Sergey Lapshyn, said he did not believe his son was a racist. "Among his acquaintances were people of different ethnic backgrounds, and I have never seen that (racism)," he said. He added his son could be "a bit tight-lipped" but was not calculating, as police had described him. Speaking from his home in Dnepropetrovsk, Lapshyn's father confirmed his own mother was a Muslim during her childhood. Lapshyn's father said his son knew his grandmother was a member of the (largely Muslim) Tatar community at the time of the former Soviet Union. "We never discussed religious problems and we always considered them to be very intimate," he said. Mr Saleem's family said their father had not done anything to deserve to die, other than be a Muslim. In a statement read out in court, Mr Saleem's daughter Shazia Khan said: "The shock and sadness of the reality is impossible to accept, yet alone accept and move on. "We can't move forward, the murder has disabled our minds in every emotional way possible." Speaking after the sentencing, Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale from West Midlands Police said Lapshyn was "very definitely driven by an extreme right-wing ideology and white supremacist ideology". Asked to describe Lapshyn's manner in police interview, he said: "He was matter-of-fact, he was cold, he was callous. "I do not think he has shown any remorse or regret for the crimes that have taken place." </body>

      <title>Funds 'mismanaged' at free school</title>
      <description>Flagship free school Kings Science Academy in Bradford is accused of financial mismanagement in a government report.</description>

      <body>One of the country's flagship free schools has been accused of serious financial mismanagement. An Education Funding Agency (EFA) report reveals allegations of financial irregularities and even possible fraud at Kings Science Academy in Bradford. As a free school it is state funded but not under local authority control. In a statement to Newsnight the school admitted there were problems in the few months after the school was set up, but said those problems had been addressed. Kings Science Academy, which is a co-educational school for 11 to 18-year-olds, opened in September 2011 and was one of England's first free schools. Newsnight spoke to a former staff member and also the school's ex-finance director both of whom voiced concerns about the running of the school. It was set up by Bradford-born teacher Sajid Raza, also known as Sajid Hussain, who is now the school's headteacher. Mr Raza said he wanted to provide a first class education to some of the city's most deprived children. The school has been praised by Prime Minister David Cameron and Education Secretary Michael Gove, both of whom have visited it. Alan Lewis, a successful businessman and the Conservative Party's vice-chairman, was a key benefactor and supporter. And the school is built on land owned by Mr Lewis and leased to the academy by his company at a cost of £296,000 a year for 20 years. A draft EFA report was leaked to the BBC's Newsnight programme, which is broadcasting an investigation into the school later on Friday, but the Department for Education (DfE) has now published a redacted final version of it on its website. In a statement attached to the redacted report the DfE said: "We found serious failings in financial management at the Kings Science Academy (KSA). We informed the police who decided no further action was necessary. "We required KSA to address these failings urgently. A plan is in place to recover funds and the school is undertaking its own investigation. Any necessary disciplinary action is a matter for the school." The DfE said that concerns about governance arrangements at the school had been flagged up to them by a whistle-blower in late 2012, and that they had examined the allegations on an already scheduled visit, arranged to look at the school's financial management. The findings of that visit combined with the school's own review of its accounting triggered a forensic investigation in early 2013, the DfE added. The school was paid a £182,933 grant when it opened in September 2011. The EFA investigation found that £59,560 of payments were not supported by any evidence of payments being made, and £10,800 of this was supported by fabricated invoices for rent. There was also a total of £26,775 which had been over-claimed against payments which had been made legitimately. And that therefore, there was a total of £86,335 which had not been used for its intended purpose. The DfE said that when the academy was spoken to about the discrepancies they were able to provide some evidence of legitimate payments which resulted in the total amount which could not be justified being reduced to £76,933. The DfE says there is a plan in place for the school to pay back that amount. The report also flagged up the fact that a number of Mr Raza's family members were hired to work at the school. His brother was on the board of governors, his sister was a senior teacher at the school, his wife also worked there and his father drove the school bus. Speaking on condition of anonymity a former staff member spoke to Newsnight about their time at the academy. "I think with the benefit of hindsight now looking back on it it's fair to say certainly the key decisions or the key power and authority was based around his family," they said. The EFA report does not say whether Mr Raza's family members were appointed through the usual processes or not. However, it did flag up that some staff were appointed without interviews. "We were informed that a small number of staff were employed by the academy without applying for posts, although they were interviewed by the governing board members to ensure their suitability," the report said. The school's former finance director Daud Khan also spoke to Newsnight. "Sajid would do a lot of things behind closed doors. He wouldn't get me involved or anybody else. And I don't know how much he was telling the governors and even if he was telling them the majority of them were all their friends anyway, so they would back him up," Mr Khan said. A statement issued on behalf of Mr Raza and the school said that the issues raised by Newsnight related to a period two years ago. "We acknowledge that there were poor governance issues during the start-up due to the pace of setting the new school up in two to three months," it said "These have since been addressed with the support of external auditors and accountants Deloittes and Crowe Clark Whitehill. All payments received from the DfE have been fully accounted for by the academy and any sums incorrectly claimed have been repaid." It added that the latest reviews by the local authority had been positive. A statement issued by Mr's Lewis' company said: "His contribution to the academy has been that of a benefactor. At no time has Mr Lewis had responsibility for the financial management of the academy." </body>

      <title>Firefighters to stage more strikes</title>
      <description>Firefighters in England and Wales are to strike on 1 and 4 November in a row over pensions, the Fire Brigades Union says.</description>

      <body>Firefighters in England and Wales are to stage two more strikes in the run-up to bonfire night in a row over pensions, the Fire Brigades Union says. The government wants firefighters to work up to 60 but the union says this is too old to be fighting fires. FBU members are due to walk out on 1 November from 18:30 to 23:00 GMT and on 4 November from 06:00 to 08:00 GMT. In the first round of action last month, 32,000 union members in England and Wales walked out, the FBU said. A second strike was called off earlier this month after progress was made during talks. The FBU postponed the five-hour strike saying that the government and fire employers had shifted their position and recognised that firefighters faced losing their jobs and a "large chunk" of their pensions under new changes imposed in April. However, the FBU now says the government and fire employers have failed to offer any firm guarantees on jobs or pensions. FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said: "The Westminster government has created this mess, but it is refusing to clear it up. "It now recognises the problem but it won't provide the legal and financial guarantees firefighters need to ensure they have a job and an unreduced pension in the future. "Firefighters face the sack towards the end of their career and the loss of their pension. That can't be right. "The employers promised to tackle the issue of firefighters facing the sack for failing fitness tests last week, only to say they can't offer any guarantees this week. "That is simply not the way to run a public service. "The government is now making threats to withdraw some of the other concessions they have made this year." The government has called the fresh action "completely unnecessary" and damaging to the fire service's reputation. Fire minister Brandon Lewis said: "Talks were progressing encouragingly and in good faith so for the FBU to walk away after only four days of negotiation is completely baffling." He said the government had matched the fitness terms accepted in Scotland and the government had facilitated talks between the FBU and their employers over the issue of firefighter fitness. London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson said it was prepared to deal with further strikes and would have 27 fire engines based at strategic points across the capital. "The evening strike date falls on the Friday before bonfire night. It is just before Diwali and coincides with half-term, so people need to be really careful with fireworks and bonfires," he said. During the first strike on 25 September, contingency plans at the 46 fire services in England and three in Wales included using part-time and volunteer firefighters, calling in non-union fire crews and bringing in private contractors. The armed forces had a back-up role and in the event of a major incident, union members could have returned to work. No major incidents were reported during the four-hour strike which was the first national walkout for a decade. </body>

      <description>A planned strike by teachers in England before Christmas is suspended after ministers agree to meet unions.</description>

      <body>Teachers in England are to suspend a planned national strike after ministers agreed to discuss the dispute. Two of the biggest teaching unions, the National Union of Teachers and the NASUWT, had planned to stage a one-day walkout before Christmas in a row over pay, pensions and conditions. But they say a strike will be held by 13 February next year if the talks do not lead to progress. It comes after a series of regional strikes by teachers this year. In a statement, the unions announced Education Secretary Michael Gove had said he was "willing to discuss a basis for genuine talks". Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said: "The public demonstration of the anger and frustration of teachers and the commitment of members to the action have secured the prospect of talks with the secretary of state. "We look forward to securing progress in these talks as quickly as possible." Christine Blower, general secretary of the NUT, said: "The successful regional strikes already undertaken show the strength of teachers' anger and concerns about the changes being made to their profession. "We are giving government the opportunity to engage in meaningful discussions with us to resolve our ongoing dispute. "We have always been available for such negotiations and would have preferred that this was a route the government had gone down sooner rather than later." Teachers are objecting to proposals by Mr Gove to bring in performance-related pay, make changes to their pensions and other changes which they say will increase their workloads. The first walkout was at the end of June in the north-west of England. Unions said 2,765 schools close or partially shut, across 22 authorities were affected. A strike on 1 October saw 2,500 schools affected across 49 authorities in the east of England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber. The most recent walkout on 17 October involved 3,5000 schools in London, Cumbria, the South East, North East and South West. </body>

      <title>Serco chief executive stands down</title>
      <description>The boss of security firm Serco resigns after accusations of overcharging the government tens of millions of pounds for electronic tags for criminals.</description>

      <body>The chief executive at Serco, a security firm at the centre of an overcharging scandal, has resigned. Outgoing boss Chris Hyman said the best way for the company to move forward "is for me to step back". Serco is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) after claims it had overcharged the government by "tens of millions" of pounds for electronic tags for criminals. The government welcomed the news, describing it as a "positive move". In July, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said an audit had revealed a "significant anomaly in the billing practices" of both Serco and rival G4S. Mr Grayling said that since 2005, the companies had in some cases been charging for tagging offenders who were in prison, had left the country or were even dead. In September, the government handed information to the SFO for their assessment. On Friday, Serco announced plans to reorganise the company. The firm said it would split the government work into a separate business that could be more closely monitored. For the moment, Mr Hyman's position will be taken over by Ed Casey, who runs the US division, while the company looks for an external full-time replacement. A government statement said it would "take full account of all the changes Serco have made today". "Whilst it is early days in their programme of renewal, this is a positive move by Serco and a step forward." The statement added that its review of government contracts, announced in July by the Justice Secretary, was continuing and would "ensure government's contractual arrangements are robust and taxpayers' money is spent responsibly, in a vibrant, competitive market for public services". Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan called for ministers to provide assurances that no confidentiality deals or "other arrangements that avoided justice" were being done. Mr Khan also asked ministers to "publish immediately the PriceWaterhouseCooper report into the activities of G4S and Serco." Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz said he was "surprised" by the resignation of Mr Hyman, because he "always maintained there is nothing untoward with the contracts Serco holds with the government". He said Mr Hyman maintained the position "even after the company was referred by Secretary of State for Justice to the SFO". Shares in Serco, which has in excess of 120,000 staff in more than 30 countries, rose after the news. It has lost more than 10% of its value since May - when the government first voiced its concerns over the tagging contract. "They were always going to have to make some sort of major change," Cantor analyst Sam Thomas said. "This is about transforming their recently damaged reputation and I think in appointing an external new chief executive they are hoping to draw a line under the previous issues." Mr Hyman said he had "always put the interests of Serco first", adding that it was important the relationship with the government was rebuilt. He said: "I have been fortunate enough to have had the privilege of working at a great company with extremely talented people. I wish everyone at Serco the very best for the future." No new contracts are being awarded to either of the firms until the audit is completed, the government said in September. The UK chief executive at G4S, Richard Morris, also stepped down on Thursday. The latest development in the scandal is likely to fuel debate over the value to the government of outsourcing public services to private companies, after G4S failed to provide enough security staff for the 2012 Olympics. </body>

      <title>UK growth fastest for three years</title>
      <description>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show, the fastest growth since 2010.</description>

      <body>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show. The Office for National Statistics said there had been a "fairly strong" performance across all sectors. The data builds on a 0.7% GDP rise in the April-June period and is the best quarterly performance since 2010. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne tweeted: "This shows that Britain's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity." Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the figures "show that we are firmly on the road to economic recovery". The ONS data for construction was up 2.5% over the quarter, the second successive quarter of growth after a volatile performance over the past year. The BBC's chief economics correspondent, Hugh Pym, said: "This could signal that a recovery in that sector is really under way." House-builders have been buoyed by the Government's Help to Buy scheme, which recently launched a new phase offering mortgage guarantees. The ONS said that production grew by 0.5%, though this remains 12.8% off its 2008 level, while within this, manufacturing improved 0.9% in the third quarter. The services sector, which represents three-quarters of economic output, grew by 0.7%. Output from services is now 0.4% above its pre-crisis peak in the first quarter of 2008. Friday's figure is the first estimate, and could be revised up or down in subsequent months. Mr Osborne told the BBC: "It shows that we are on the path to prosperity. Lots of risks remain, so we have to stick with the economic plan that has got us this far. "What's encouraging about these figures is that it's not just services that are growing. Construction is growing and manufacturing is growing." Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: "After three damaging years of flatlining, it's both welcome and long overdue that our economy is growing again. "But for millions of people across the country still seeing prices rising faster than their wages, this is no recovery at all." Despite the further evidence that recovery is gaining hold, some economists remain cautious. The Institute of Directors' chief economist Graeme Leach said: "The outlook looks better than at any time since the onset of the financial crisis. Indeed, our members have more confidence in the economy than at any time since 2008. "However, strong headwinds remain and the annual growth rate year on year is nothing to get too excited about yet. Though inflationary pressures are likely to remain benign, debt and inflation are rising faster than earnings. "By far the biggest challenges remain on the supply side, not the demand side. Supply side constraints mean that the current growth spurt is unlikely to extend beyond next year. "This stage of our economic recovery is likely to be short and sweet, instead of long and strong." The director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, John Longworth, said: "This is the highest quarterly increase we've seen in three years, so the economy is clearly moving in the right direction. "But we are still behind a number of advanced economies, such as the US and Germany, that have managed to recover the output lost during the economic downturn. "Much more needs to be done to transform our economy from being good to being really great." Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said the figures confirmed the UK was enjoying "a period of healthy and well-balanced growth". He said it was likely that the UK recorded the fastest quarterly growth rate within the G7 countries in the third quarter. But he added that a squeeze on real incomes as wage growth lagged behind inflation, together with the fiscal squeeze and a stagnant eurozone, were likely to prevent recovery gathering much more pace. It echoed remarks by Bank of England governor Mark Carney on Thursday evening, when he said in a speech that the rate of growth was "towards the top end of the advanced economies", but "coming from a very very low base". </body>

      <body>A second letter bomb addressed to a serving senior police officer has been discovered at a mail sorting office in Northern Ireland. The package was found at a Royal Mail depot in Lisburn, County Antrim. It comes hours after a device in a package addressed to the PSNI chief constable was intercepted at a sorting office in north Belfast. Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr said it was thought that dissident republicans were behind both incidents. He also blamed dissidents for pipe bomb attacks on police vehicles in Londonderry and the outskirts of Belfast over the last three days. "All four, along with other attacks this months, have been designed to kill police officers," he told a press conference on Friday. "We are very lucky we are not dealing with a fatality this morning." An Army bomb team dealt with the device at Mallusk, north Belfast, early on Friday. It had been addressed to Matt Baggott at police headquarters in Knock, east Belfast. Later, a delivery office at Linenhall Street, Lisburn, was evacuated following the discovery of a suspicious object. The police said that both packages contained a viable device. Justice Minister David Ford said of the first device: "Those who sent this device have no concern whatsoever for the staff at the Mallusk sorting office, whose vigilance is to be commended." Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said the Mallusk attack was "callous and reckless". "Those responsible for this device have almost no support and have demonstrated a blatant disregard for the safety of those who could have been injured," she said. "The chief constable undertakes a challenging role in delivering community policing in a difficult environment." A spokeswoman for Royal Mail said: "The Northern Ireland mail centre at Mallusk was evacuated overnight due to a suspect package. "Unfortunately there will be an effect on deliveries today and we apologise for any inconvenience this may cause." Police have appealed for the public to be vigilant and report anything that looks suspicious. </body>

      <body>Warnings of stormy weather in England and Wales on Sunday night and Monday have been extended to more areas. A Met Office amber alert of high winds in southern Wales and southern England now includes much of the Midlands, the East, and London and the South East. People are being warned of the risk of falling trees and damage to buildings, with gusts of up to 80 mph (120 kph), possibly higher around exposed coasts There is also concern heavy rain could cause surface water flooding. A yellow alert predicting heavy rain on Monday covers the whole of England and Wales. It is the lowest level of the three warnings issued by the Met Office, and advises people to "be aware". An amber alert, advising people to "be prepared" for potentially hazardous conditions, is one level up from this. BBC Weather presenter Peter Gibbs said a strong Atlantic jet stream is providing the "driving force" for the storm, which is expected to hit central England and Wales UK late on Sunday night and run across the country in a north-eastwardly direction. The strongest winds are expected on the storms southern and western flanks. Forecasters say a "very intense low pressure system" brings the potential for strong winds, especially on exposed coasts in Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Hampshire, West Sussex, East Sussex and Kent. Temperatures of up to 15C on Monday will be above average. The Met Office said "the public should be prepared for the risk of falling trees as well as damage to buildings and other structures, bringing disruption to transport and power supplies". But there is still some uncertainty as to exactly when the storm will reach the country. Eddy Carroll, chief forecaster at the Met Office, said: "This storm doesn't exist at the moment, but our forecast models predict it is likely to develop in the west Atlantic on Saturday. "Then it's likely to rapidly intensify just west of the UK late on Sunday before tracking across England and Wales early on Monday. "There is still a chance this storm may take a more southerly track and miss the UK, bringing impacts elsewhere in northern Europe, but people should be aware there is a risk of severe weather and significant disruption." The AA said stormy conditions could cause "significant travel disruption on Monday morning... one of the busiest times on the roads". Darron Burness, head of the AA's flood rescue team, said: "Strong wind and torrential rain is an unpredictable and hazardous combination, which can be quite overwhelming when you're driving. "There's likely to be tree and other debris on the roads as well potential flooding, so it's very important to keep your speed down and drive with great care." There is more information about the forecasts for Sunday and Monday on the BBC Weather and Met Office websites.

      <title>Man guilty of business partner death</title>
      <description>A man is found guilty of murdering his business partner and throwing her down a well shaft in an attempt to gain a £1m inheritance.</description>

      <body>A man has been found guilty of murdering his business partner and throwing her down a well shaft in an attempt to gain a £1m inheritance. A jury at Reading Crown Court found Christopher Symons, 63, of Cambridge Street, Aylesbury, had killed Patricia Goodband, 76, in December. Her body was found concealed in the well in the grounds of her home near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, in January. Symons, who had denied murder, will be sentenced on Monday. The court earlier heard allegations that Symons "used" his sister Kathleen Adams and his lover Jennifer Creasey to hide his crime. Ms Adams, 74, of Aylesbury Road, Princes Risborough, was found not guilty of one count of perverting the course of justice. Creasey, 73, of Hale Road, Benson, Oxfordshire, was found guilty of one of two counts of the same charge. Symons' friend Robert Taft, 59, of Kings Close, Westcott, Aylesbury, had previously admitted perverting the course of justice and possession of ammunition without a certificate. Taft and Creasey will also be sentenced on Monday. Ms Goodband, who was last seen on 17 December, was reported missing by her daughter on 9 January. Her body was found on 21 January. During Symons' trial, the court heard Ms Goodband had been friends with him for more than 30 years and had run a road haulage and agricultural business with him from her home in Woodham. The prosecution said he killed her on 22 December in a "cold blooded, planned murder for financial gain", and his "motive was clear". A post-mortem examination found she died from head injuries. The defence had said much of the evidence against Mr Symons was "circumstantial and incomplete". Symons told police he dropped Mrs Goodband off at Milton Keynes station so she could go away over Christmas. His defence admitted this was untrue, but said Mr Symons was a man who lived a life of pretence and the fact he had lied did not mean he was guilty of murder. Det Supt Chris Ward from Thames Valley Police said Symons' actions were "pre-meditated and motivated purely by greed". "In order to inherit her property and share of their business, [he] devised a cruel and calculated plan to murder Patricia and make it appear as if she vanished without a trace," he said. "This has been a complex inquiry in which we have had to unpick all of Symons' lies in order to uncover the truth." </body>

      <title>Cameron shares 'spying concerns'</title>
      <description>David Cameron says he shares the concerns of other EU leaders about alleged US spying but defends the UK's transatlantic intelligence relationship.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has said he shares the concerns of other EU leaders about claims that US intelligence agencies monitored the phone calls of Angela Merkel and other European politicians. The prime minister said a statement released by all 28 leaders saying that trust must be rebuilt between Europe and the US was "good and sensible". Reports he was forced to sign up to the text are wrong, the BBC understands. The PM also stressed the UK had a "unique" security alliance with the US. Allegations that US agencies engaged in widespread tapping of phone calls by prominent European politicians dominated the two-day European Council summit in Brussels. Germany has said it is unacceptable that an ally eavesdropped on conversations made by its chancellor and has made clear that co-operation between the two countries in this area must change in the future. French president Francois Hollande has said trust needed to be "restored and reinforced" following the revelations by whistle-blower Edward Snowden about the activities of the National Security Agency (NSA). Both leaders want talks with US officials later this year to agree an "understanding on mutual relations". Speaking at a press conference at the end of the summit, Mr Cameron said the EU wanted a "good partnership" with the US in all matters, including intelligence. "I think what Angela and Francois want to do is entirely sensible and other European countries are free to join in with that," he said. "I was very struck by my colleagues how they don't want some breach between the EU and the US." Defending the work of the UK security services, he said every country had to be satisfied that their operations were subject to proper oversight and the UK had "strengthened" its controls. "I am satisfied our intelligence agencies are properly governed. The work they do is very important. Every year they helped obstruct, put off, major terrorist attacks, in our country and other European countries too." He added: "Britain has a unique partnership with the USA (on security). For us we are in the right situation, but I understand what others want to do and support that, as I think does President Obama." The Daily Telegraph has claimed that Mr Cameron was effectively forced to sign up to the joint statement on spying. But the BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said the prime minister had offered his support, unprompted, during the news conference and the text of the statement only emerged during conversations over dinner on Thursday. However, it is understood conversations on the subject were uncomfortable for Mr Cameron. Asked about separate claims that the UK had eavesdropped on the conversations of Italian politicians, Mr Cameron said he could not comment on specific national security matters. But he insisted that the UK's security services operated within the legal framework and pointed out that Britain shared its intelligence extensively with EU partners. The prime minister also insisted the Snowden revelations would make the world more dangerous as they signalled "to people who mean to do us harm how to evade and avoid intelligence and surveillance and other techniques". </body>

      <title>Man denies owning 3D printer gun</title>
      <description>A man suspected of possessing a 3D printer with component parts to make a gun says the seized equipment had "nothing to do with a gun whatsoever".</description>

      <body>A man suspected of possessing a 3D printer with component parts to make a gun said the seized equipment had "nothing to do with a gun whatsoever". It follows police raids in Greater Manchester on Thursday, in which officers seized computer equipment. The arrested man said the suspicious parts were simply parts for the 3D printer. Experts have also cast doubts on the claims, saying the parts were not sophisticated enough to make a gun. 3D printing technology works by building up layer upon layer of material - typically plastic - to create complex solid objects. Greater Manchester Police said the components had been sent to the National Ballistics Service for further examination. The results are expected in the next few days. The force said it "cannot categorically say" whether they had recovered the component parts that could make a "viable" gun. US based printer maker, MakerBot Industries, which makes the components, said the company had examined the photographs. Jennifer Howard, the firm's director of PR, said: "We've seen the photographs and they definitely look like parts for the printer. "The first one looks like a pin that goes with an extruder upgrade - there is an upgrade kit that is available to make your printer work better. "The second looks like a filament spool, certainly that is what people who 3D print recognise it as." Brian Derby, professor of material science at Manchester University, said the printer was a "hobbyist's machine". He said: "It would make something that would look like a gun but it would not work as a gun." "You would have to buy an expensive machine for about £50,000 but you could get a real gun. "What is made is not likely to work. It is dangerous and likely to harm the person using it." The arrested man, who does not want to identified, was held following a police raid in Wythenshawe. "I have no idea why they think it is part of a gun," he said. "It's designed by the company that makes the printer to go in the printer to make it better." Assistant Chief Constable Steve Heywood, who is a member of the national firearms group, said: "What I would say is that its actually incredibly difficult to create the whole weapon. "And even if you do create the weapon its still incredibly difficult to fire it because it tends to blow up in your face." He said officers were "absolutely legitimate to get a warrant from the magistrate go in and do the search that we did". A GMP spokesman earlier said if the tests showed the parts could make a functioning weapon it would be the "first ever seizure of this kind in the UK". Asst Ch Con Heywood said: "We need to be absolutely clear that at that this stage, we cannot categorically say we have recovered the component parts for a 3D gun. "What we have seized are items that need further forensic testing by national ballistics experts to establish whether they can be used in the construction of a genuine, viable firearm." "It is prudent we establish exactly what these parts can be used for and whether they pose any threat." The raid was part of GMP's Operation Challenger, which aims to "dismantle" organised criminal gangs. Desktop 3D printers can be bought on the high street for less than £1,000, but prices can be as high as £10,000. The world's first gun made with 3D printer technology was successfully fired in the US in May. At the time, Europe's law enforcement agency Europol said it feared criminals would follow suit as the technology became cheaper and more user friendly. </body>

      <title>Probation officers' strike date set</title>
      <description>Probation officers in England and Wales are to strike on 5 November in row over government plans to privatise the service, their union Napo announces.</description>

      <body>Probation officers in England and Wales are to go on strike for 24 hours over government plans to privatise the service, their union has said. They plan to walk out on 5 November - one day after an expected postal workers' strike. Their union said negotiations with ministers were ongoing but that it wanted to highlight the dangers of privatisation. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said it had contingency plans in place. It was only the fourth time in Napo's history that it had announced industrial action, the trade union said. Under the MoJ's proposals, private companies and charities would take over much of the probation service. They are currently bidding for £450m worth of contracts to supervise low and medium-risk offenders. Napo say 80% of its members have voted to go on strike, on a 46% turnout. A spokeswoman said 7,500 workers would be affected. "Our members don't take the decision to strike lightly, said general secretary Ian Lawrence. "But they feel so strongly about the privatisation of the Probation Service and the impact this will have on community safety, that they feel they have no choice. "The public need to be aware of how the secretary of state's plans will impact on their safety and their communities." It comes as the Fire Brigades Union announced two further strike dates in their dispute over pensions. The postal, fire and probation service actions come in a week when the People's Assembly - a coalition of trade unions and political activists - plan a series of demonstrations across the country. The government says it wants the Probation Service to operate under a system of payment-by-results. The MoJ has said that more than 700 organisations, including hundreds of British firms, have expressed an interest in bidding for the contracts. Justice minister Jeremy Wright described the planned strike as "in favour of the status quo" and of "high reoffending rates". He added: "More than 600,000 offences were committed last year by those who had broken the law before, despite spending £4bn a year on prisons and probation. "The public deserves better and we are committed to introducing our important reforms, which were widely consulted on. "We have well-established contingency arrangements to deal with any potential action. We will continue to support staff and engage with unions as our reforms move forwards." </body>

      <body>A 16-year-old boy has been sentenced to eight years and three months for an acid attack on a woman in east London. Tara Quigley, 28, suffered injuries to her face and upper body when acid was thrown at her as she answered the door at her home in Romford on 30 April. Liam Robert Sibbons pleaded guilty to a charge of throwing corrosive fluid on a person with intent to do grievous bodily harm (GBH). Sibbons will serve six years and three months in custody. He will be released on licence for the remainder of his sentence. The teenager can now be named after Judge David Radford lifted a reporting restriction. Prosecutor Martin Whitehouse told Snaresbrook Crown Court: "This was a horrific attack, involving a degree of brutality and callousness rarely encountered. "Almost, one might say, beyond comprehension." Miss Quigley, who did not know the teenager, has been left permanently scarred and will need regular treatment over the next four years. She suffered burns to 7% of her body, including her right arm, forearm, shoulder, chest, neck and face. The court heard that most of the burns went almost all the way through her skin and Miss Quigley has had two skin grafts which have only been 85% successful. In a victim impact statement, Miss Quigley, who was in court, said: "The attack has left me feeling as though my life has been blown apart." She added she was in constant pain and did not feel safe returning to her home. "I will have to live with this attack and the scars it has left me with for the rest of my life and nothing I can say or do will change that," she said. "I truly hope that the man responsible knows just what he has done and the grief and anguish he has caused to me and my entire family." Mr Whitehouse said Miss Quigley had been at home when she saw someone approaching the house. When she opened the door she was asked by the person if she was called Michelle. She replied no and the person walked off, however 10 minutes later there was a loud knock on the door. The prosecutor said: "Miss Quigley opened the front door and saw the same man. He was holding onto a white bottle with both hands. "He then pointed the bottle at Miss Quigley and squeezed." Mr Whitehouse said Miss Quigley felt an almost immediate burning sensation when the liquid came into contact with her skin. The court heard she shut the door and began to scream, and then ran into the kitchen and started splashing water on her face. An ambulance was called and Miss Quigley was taken to hospital for treatment. Sibbons received an acid burn to the left side of his chest during the attack. He had four previous convictions and was on bail at the time of the incident. Judge Radford said Sibbons had refused to explain why he carried out the attack. The judge said: "It was, in my judgment, a truly wicked offence, which clearly was premeditated." He added that the attack could have been a case of mistaken identity and a large amount of money had been found after the teenager was arrested. "Whether this was because you were being paid to commit this offence and there was some kind of mistake about the identity of the victim is a matter for speculation in the absence of candour and honesty on your part," the judge said. </body>

      <body>Labour has questioned Parliament's relationship with a ticketing firm after it emerged the company had earned more than £350,000 in fees for selling tour tickets since the start of 2012. MP Luciana Berger said: "Taxpayers have a right to expect value for money. "The parliamentary authorities should look very closely at their ticketing arrangements and ensure they represent the best possible deal for the public." Visitors can book £16.50 advance tickets through Ticketmaster. It was revealed that Ticketmaster received £194,000 in fees last year, and £170,000 so far this year. Ms Berger said the fees paid to Ticketmaster represented a lot of money when there was huge pressure on public sector budgets. But spokesman for Parliament said the contract was decided by a competitive tender, won by Ticketmaster in 2009. He said: "The contract has recently gone out to tender again. Bids are in the process of being evaluated. The objective, as with all procurements, is to get the best deal." Parliament sold advance tickets worth almost £2m over the period. Members of the public can also arrange tours for free with their MP, or queue for tickets to the public gallery of the House of Commons. </body>

      <body>A monkey that escaped from Belfast zoo has been recaptured, after zoo staff shot it with a tranquilliser gun. The animal fell from a tree after it was sedated by zoo staff at Gideon's Green in Newtownabbey, County Antrim. A hydraulic lift, supplied by the fire service, was used to help zoo keepers reach the monkey in the trees. It was one of six lion-tailed macaques that escaped from the zoo on Monday. Five have now been recaptured but one monkey is still missing. Up to 12 zoo staff arrived in Gideon's Green after the monkey was spotted up a tree on Friday afternoon. A large crowd gathered to watch their attempts to capture the animal. The missing macaques had been spotted several times in the north Belfast and Newtownabbey areas over recent days. On Thursday, one of the monkeys was captured by zoo keepers in the grounds of Belfast Castle. Another escaped macaque scaled a "peace line" fence outside a primary school in Newtownabbey. It was spotted, perched on the peace line, during the school run on Thursday morning. Children at Hazelwood Integrated primary school, on the Whitewell Road, enticed the monkey down from the fence by offering it bananas. However, the animal took the bananas and escaped before zoo staff arrived. </body>

      <title>Surgery offer for ex-'fattest man'</title>
      <description>A US surgeon offers to remove excess skin from a British man once dubbed the world's fattest.</description>

      <body>A plastic surgeon in the US has offered to operate on a British man once dubbed the world's fattest. At his heaviest, Paul Mason weighed 70 stone (444kg) and was bed bound at his bungalow in Ipswich, Suffolk. He now weighs about 24 stone (152kg) after gastric bypass surgery in 2010 but says his life is being hampered by a huge amount of excess skin. New York-based surgeon Dr Jennifer Capla said she was willing to donate her time to help Mr Mason. In May, Mr Mason, 52, released photographs of his naked body as part of his plea for medical help. Mr Mason said he had begun trying to raise the money to pay for flights and a hospital stay in order to take advantage of Dr Capla's offer. Dr Capla told BBC Radio Suffolk she had read about Mr Mason and his weight loss in the New York Times. "He is a high-risk patient and he has a lot of medical issues that we need to sort through," she said. "However, he's a great candidate for this skin removal surgery. "He has lost over 600lbs (272kg) and he should be very functional and mobile and should be able to live his life but he's still wheelchair-bound because he has all this excess skin. "Helping him get his life back is really the goal." Dr Capla said she specialised in "post-bariatric body contouring" but that although she had treated patients who has lost up to 200lbs (90kg) she had never treated anyone who had lost as much weight as Mr Mason. "The skin is the same in terms of looseness and the areas of target so it's an area I'm very familiar with," she said. Mr Mason said he had "things in motion" to raise the money needed. "All I've got to cover is the medication, the stay in hospital and the flights," she said. Mr Mason has not been able to have the surgery on the NHS because his weight has not been stable. He said an operation to remove excess skin around his middle would make a huge difference. "I would be able to mobilise and lead a reasonably normal life, then have my arms and legs done," he said. "Five years down the road it would possibly have to be repeated because by then I should be at my goal weight and the excess skin I would have then would still need removing because of the extreme size I was in the first place." A spokesman for the NHS Ipswich and East Suffolk Clinical Commissioning Group said: "Before a patient has an operation it is important to take a balanced decision that is in the best interest of that patient. "In cases like this the NHS has a panel of people - including clinicians - who decide whether the patient should have such an operation. A patient must have a stable weight before he or she is considered." </body>

      <body>A man has been found guilty of the attempted murder of County Armagh woman Natasha McShane and her friend Stacy Jurich in Chicago three years ago. Heriberto Viramontes, 34, was convicted at Cook County Criminal Court in the US city on Thursday. The pair were attacked and robbed in the early hours of 23 April, 2010. Ms McShane, who had been attending the University of Illinois at the time of the assault, has been left with severe brain damage. Just before 18:00 local time - midnight UK time - on Thursday, her family, along with Stacy Jurich and her family, were called for the verdict. The trial lasted five days, it took three and a half hours to find Viramontes guilty on all charges. There were emotional scenes as the verdicts were delivered. Shortly afterwards, a statement written by Natasha's brother, Conor, was read out to the press by the state's attorney. "This crime against my sister has changed my life forever. It has had a devastating impact on our entire family," the statement said. Conor McShane said the family was pleased and relieved at the verdicts. But he also said that Natasha's life had been ruined by the attack. She has been left unable to talk or walk unaided. Stacy Jurich said that the time since the attack had been the most difficult in her life. "We have had a lot of support from our families, friends and complete strangers," she said. "But the last three and a half years have been the hardest time in my entire life. Not only was it a struggle for me, but it has been a struggle to face what happened to my best friend, Natasha - something I will never forget." Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez said: "Chicago is a beautiful city, it is a shame that someone like Natasha McShane, who was here to continue her schooling, someone who was visiting from Ireland, that she was not able to enjoy all the beauty that Chicago has to offer. "Instead of welcoming our visitors with an open heart, she was confronted with a baseball bat. I am very pleased that this man has been held responsible for the brutal and senseless beating of both Stacy Jurich and Natasha McShane." Viramontes faces between six and 120 years in prison. In July, his accomplice Marcy Cruz was jailed for 22 years after pleading guilty to two counts of attempted murder over the attack. </body>

      <title>Man jailed over guns and ammunition</title>
      <description>A Belfast man who claimed he was trying to pay off a drug debt when he was caught with guns and ammunition is jailed for 18 months.</description>

      <body>A Belfast man has been jailed for 18 months for having guns and ammunition. Paul McDade, from Sheridan Street in the city, was arrested in September when police stopped his car on the A1 near Hillsborough, County Down. Officers found two 9mm semi-automatic handguns and two magazines containing 14 bullets. They had been hidden in a spare wheel in the boot of the vehicle. Belfast Crown Court heard McDade had told police that he was transporting the guns to pay off a drug debt. The 53 year old pleaded guilty to having firearms and ammunition under suspicious circumstances and possession of an offensive weapon. A prosecution barrister told the court a search of McDade's phone revealed a text message under the name of 'Mate' which talked of the accused being given "the wrong one by mistake". The message said the sender needed it back or "he would be in trouble". McDade told police in a written statement during interview that he did not know what was in the spare tyre. He told officers he had only collected the tyre from a car park to pay off a drug debt as he was addicted to cannabis. The court also heard that there was no forensic or DNA evidence to suggest he had handled the guns or ammunition. The prosecution barrister revealed that McDade already had a criminal record, including a conviction in 1979 for a similar offence of possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances. The defence team said pressure was applied to their client to become a "stooge" or a "mule". They said he was under duress to collect the weapons and ammunition to pay off his drug debts. "He accepts he was transporting firearms and ammunition which could be used. He was in fact a courier for others," a defence lawyer said. However, the judge said: "I don't believe this is a drugs case as no drugs were found in the car. "He had a prepared statement which meant that he could not be questioned by police. "Transporting two re-commissioned guns with a total of 14 rounds of ammunition is a serious offence. "He knew that he was transporting these firearms and I don't think he was doing it under duress." She told him that he would serve 18 months of a four year sentence in custody with the remaining further two-and-a-half years to be spent on licence following his release. The Belfast Crown Court judge also ordered the forfeiture of the BMW car he was driving when the weapons were found and she recommended the proceeds of the sale go to Addiction NI. Speaking after the sentencing on Friday, a spokesman for the PSNI's Serious Crime Branch said: "We are pleased to have taken two guns and ammunition off the streets of Northern Ireland. "We believe these reactivated Makarov pistols originated in eastern Europe. As a result of our investigation, everyone in our community is safer today." </body>

      <title>£90,000 fine after worker loses arm</title>
      <description>A recycling firm is fined £90,000 after an employee lost an arm in an accident which was "waiting to happen".</description>

      <body>A recycling firm has been fined £90,000 after an employee lost an arm in an accident which was "waiting to happen". Neath Port Talbot Recycling Ltd was also ordered to pay £50,000 costs following the incident in 2011. Swansea Crown court heard a similar incident happened in 2007 and over the following years the firm had been warned about its health and safety measures. The company said it deeply regretted what happened to employee Stephen John. The court was told how the 57-year-old was asked to clean a conveyor belt which had become blocked with a sticky black substance known as flack. The company did not have any risk assessment or safe system of work for completing this task, and experienced employees like Mr John had developed their own way of cleaning the conveyor belt roller. This system of work was devised partly because the control switch was located some distance away from the actual conveyor. To clean the rollers, one employee stood by the control switch, which is out of sight from the conveyor, and a second person inserted a bar and scraped the flack from the roller. He then inserted his arm to wipe away the flack. A command was given to the switch controller and the conveyor was started and stopped quickly. The process was repeated until the roller was clean. The court heard on the day of the incident, Mr John inserted his arm and was wiping the flack away. He then passed the bar to a work colleague. The switch controller misinterpreted this as a signal and started the conveyor. Mr John's right forearm was trapped and amputated by the conveyor belt. Speaking after the hearing, Health and Safety Executive (HSE) inspector Sarah Baldwin-Jones said the potential for greater harm or a fatal accident was also a realistic possibility. "The company failed to fully guard the conveyor around the tail end roller and this failure resulted in employees having access to dangerous parts of the machine," she said. "The risk of entrapment is well known in the industry, and this company could have taken simple steps to fit guarding. "There was also no line of sight between Mr John and the employee operating the machinery and the company failed to carry out a risk assessment when the conveyor was installed. "They also failed to devise a safe way of cleaning the rollers and to instruct employees on how to clean them safely." Neath Port Talbot Recycling of Crymlyn Burrows, Swansea, pleaded guilty to two safety breaches. Managing director Will Watson told BBC Wales the company deeply regretted what had happened and that issues at the plant had now been addressed. </body>

      <body>A Welsh government minister has been criticised for giving "evasive" answers to an assembly committee. The assembly's environment committee said Natural Resources Minister Alun Davies gave them contradictory information about his portfolio. Members condemned his department for financial management and planning failures, including "basic errors" in its draft budget. The Welsh government said issues raised were "flawed and inaccurate". In a letter to the Finance Committee about the Natural Resources department's budget, the AMs said: "We are disappointed with the timeliness of information provided by the minister, and the oral evidence session, where a number of questions were evaded or contradictory information provided. "We believe that this is an indicator of problems at the heart of financial management and planning of this department and we will continue to keep a very close eye on these issues both in-year and at future budget rounds. "We believe the department's approach to financial management hinders general transparency. We are therefore unable to assess whether the budget is appropriately prioritised and is providing value for money." Mr Davies was criticised after £342m of farm subsidy payments were left out of the government's supplementary budget earlier this year due to what he called an "administrative error". Committee members said that while the minister said there would be no impact on farmers, "there is a discrepancy between officials and the minister about whether or not this shortfall will need to be covered from other areas within the Welsh Government budget". The Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, William Powell, said that Mr Davies' performance before the Environment Committee was "embarrassing" and showed a "lack of competence". "The Minister's budget included a number of basic errors, such as referring to schemes and policy areas that have ceased to exist," said Mr Powell. The Welsh government responded strongly to the critical letter. A spokesperson said: "The majority of the issues raised are simply flawed and inaccurate and we do not accept them. "The content and tone of the letter are also wholly misleading. "The Minister for Natural Resources and Food will be writing to the Chair of the Environment Committee shortly to address the issues raised." </body>

      <body>Scottish councils have imposed a pay deal on their staff after almost a year of negotiations failed to reach an agreement. Council staff other than teachers will get a 1% rise backdated to April of this year - and a further 1% rise next April. The decision was taken at a meeting of the council umbrella body Cosla. Cosla said it could not allow the "dragging of feet" by the Unison union to continue. "This cannot continue any longer - our employees deserve their pay rise now," said Cosla's human resources spokesman, Councillor Billy Hendry. "We have been in negotiations with the Scottish Joint Council trade unions for almost a full year after making an initial offer in November 2012. "The unions remain divided and the time has come to apply the deal." Mr Hendry added: "I am particularly pleased with the ground-breaking award of a living wage of £7.50 per hour in 2013/14, which will deliver real benefits for employees at the lower end of the pay scale, and an agreement to match the recommended figure due next month from the Living Wage Foundation for 2014/15, which will see a further living wage increase for the lowest paid." The pay deal does not apply to teachers. Earlier this week the largest teachers' union, the EIS, rejected changes to their terms and conditions of employment. The pay deal was conditional on accepting these changes. Mr Hendry continued: "It is deeply frustrating for me that I am not in a position to announce a pay increase at this time for our teaching workforce. "The decision by the EIS not to agree a deal has resulted in what we believe is an unnecessary delay. "Talks will continue in November which we hope will also bring this matter to a conclusion." </body>

      <description>Four men are jailed after a stash of weapons and ammunition - including an Uzi sub-machine gun with silencer - was found at a railway station.</description>

      <body>Four men have been jailed after a stash of weapons and ammunition - including an Uzi sub-machine gun with silencer - was found at a railway station. Serving soldier William Dempsey left bags of weapons at Carlisle station after getting off a train to Glasgow. He collected them from James Ashdown in Kent. They were destined for Barry Kelly and Craig Colquhoun in Scotland. Dempsey and Ashdown were each jailed for eight years. Kelly was given nine years and Colquhoun seven years. Dempsey and Ashdown had previously admitted conspiracy to buy or sell illegal firearms. Kelly and Darvel were found guilty by a jury of the same offences earlier this month. Liverpool Crown Court heard how Dempsey, 29, from Paisley, left two Army camouflage bags containing the Uzi sub-machine gun, silencer, a handgun and a sawn-off double-barrelled shotgun with two cleaners at the station. He asked them to look after the bags for him as he thought he was being followed. The court heard that the mortarman with the 5th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, was dressed in desert combat uniform and had been exhibiting "somewhat bizarre behaviour". He told staff there were snipers at the station. He had collected the firearms from his friend Ashdown, 32, in Canterbury, where Dempsey's barracks were. The court heard how the bags, found on 17 August last year, also contained Dempsey's identification papers and 194 rounds of ammunition which had his name embroidered on them. They were destined for Kelly, 34, from Darvel, Ayrshire, and Colquhoun, 28, from Barrhead. A search at Dempsey's barracks uncovered a handgun-shaped crossbow, several metal tipped arrows and large military batteries. The battalion duty officer confirmed to British Transport Police that no weapons were missing from the armoury. British Transport Police said Dempsey's mobile phone revealed messages between him and Ashdown regarding large cash payments for "toys" - items believed to be the firearms seized at Carlisle. Further investigation revealed links to both Colquhoun and Kelly. On 16 August last year Colquhoun was captured on CCTV at the Royal Bank of Scotland in Paisley paying £3,500 into Dempsey's account. While arresting Kelly, Ashdown and Colquhoun police found £20,000 hidden in the loft of Kelly's house. Prosecutor Nicholas Kennedy said it was not known where the Uzi and handgun were from but the shotgun had been stolen in a burglary at farm buildings in Maidstone in February 2007. Sentencing the four, Judge Robert Warnock said: "I am wholly satisfied that they [the weapons] were destined for use in serious crime and had a clear potential for causing serious injury and death. "Had these firearms reached their intended recipients, I have no doubt they would have significantly contributed to the upward spiral of gun crime in this country." The judge told Demspey he had used his uniform to hide what he was doing on the day he was arrested. "For reasons principally to do with your abuse of alcohol and drugs, you abandoned the firearms at Carlisle station," he said. "I make it clear, however, that these actions were not motivated by remorse or insight but your befuddled and confused thinking brought on by your alcohol and drug abuse and your consequential paranoia and instability." The judge told Kelly he was "clearly a relatively sophisticated criminal who is well-versed in the use and abuse of mobile phone technology". He said his "employee" Colquhoun was a peripheral player in the conspiracy. The court heard that Ashdown, of no fixed address, was an active street dealer of drugs who was motivated to make money to fund his cocaine habit. He was jailed for an additional three years for possession and intent to supply cocaine in a separate case. Mitigating for Dempsey, David Thompson said his client had joined the Army at the age of 17 and had served in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. He was described as a "reliable and competent soldier" but his life began to go downhill last July. He had alcohol and drug problems and had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after his battleground stints. At the time he entered the firearms conspiracy he had accumulated a drug debt of £5,000. Mr Thompson said he was exposed to influences in his home town of Paisley - which he had joined the Army to get away from when he was younger. He said Dempsey "in effect abandoned the consignment at the rail station and disappeared into town." "He tells me he knew he was going to be arrested and was enjoying a final pint of beer." Mr Thompson said it was "a crying shame" that the defendant had become involved in a conspiracy "diametrically opposed" to the 12 years of service he had given to his country. "He is filled with remorse for getting involved and the shame he has brought upon his regiment," the barrister said. The court heard that Kelly maintained his innocence. Following sentencing, Det Ch Insp Simon Taylor, who led British Transport Police's investigation, said: "These four clearly intended to put illegal firearms on to the streets of Scotland and it is a fair assumption that they would have been used to commit criminal acts or to intimidate people. "In uncovering and unravelling the complex conspiracy BTP, in partnership with Kent Police and Police Scotland, have taken this potential threat out of circulation and ensured the conviction of four dangerous men." </body>

      <body>Troubled Sunderland may have been anything but infallible this season, but one man appears to be keeping the faith. Pope Francis has been given a personalised Black Cats shirt ahead of this weekend's derby clash with arch-rivals Newcastle United. The shirt was presented to him by Father Marc Lyden-Smith, who is Sunderland Football Club's chaplain. He is in Rome with Bishop Seamus Cunningham and a group of pilgrims. Fr Lyden-Smith said: "We have 60 pilgrims from the North East in Rome at the moment visiting churches and shrines. As part of the pilgrimage we took part in the papal audience on Wednesday morning. "As chaplain of Sunderland Football Club, they asked if I could present him with a shirt that had his name on the back - Papa Francesco. "It was a bit of a miracle really. There were 120,000 people gathered in the square. We managed to get tickets up at the front and the pope was guided towards us. "Some people from the North East managed to shake his hand and then I asked if he would accept the shirt and he took it and waved it in the air to cheers." Asked if the pope would be supporting the team against fierce rivals Newcastle United at Sunderland's Stadium of Light on Sunday, he said: "He is very diplomatic and wouldn't say that. "He's a keen football fan - he was a season ticket holder before he was elected as pope." </body>

      <body>Police had twice visited the home of a missing teenager before a body was found in the garden, it has emerged. Miller Redpath, 18, was reported missing by his mother Anastasia Miller, who last saw him on 13 August at their house in Wenhaston, Suffolk. On Thursday a body was found in the overgrown garden of the property. Suffolk Police has referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) because of the previous visits to the home. The body has not yet been identified and the results of a post-mortem examination have not yet been released. The death is being treated as unexplained. A spokesman for Suffolk police said officers first went to Mr Redpath's home in August following a "report of a crime". They then visited at the beginning of October and a "search of the property was carried out", the spokesman said. He added: "Miller had not been seen since mid-August and due to concern from his mother around his well-being a missing person inquiry was launched by police on 15 October. "As part of the missing person inquiry a further search of the address was made on 24 October when the body was discovered. "As a matter of course this matter has been referred to the IPCC as there is a mandatory requirement to do so if there is a death or serious injury following direct or indirect police contact. "This is a routine procedure that ensures transparency in the way incidents are responded to." </body>

      <body>England coach Steve McNamara cut short his news conference ahead of their World Cup opener against Australia. McNamara walked out after six minutes as he was questioned on his selection decisions. Second row forward Gareth Hock was removed from the squad after a breach of discipline following England's 15-14 defeat by Italy in a warm-up game. Prop James Graham has not been selected for Saturday's opener with the Kangaroos at the Millennium Stadium. Hock told the BBC that he does not think his breach of discipline was serious enough for him to be removed from England's World Cup squad. The forward, 30, said he and some team-mates went on a night out after England's surprise defeat by Italy. McNamara refused to discuss the disciplinary issues during the media conference and no players were made available to speak. The England coach was questioned about absence of Graham from his 19-man squad, amid speculation that the former St Helens forward had been involved in the post-Italy game incident. "There are seven very good players not playing this week," McNamara said. "I'm certainly not going to talk about any individuals among those seven. "They are all great players, great people and I'm sure they'll get a part to play during the rest of the tournament." McNamara denied it had been a tough week for him ahead of the opener with Australia and has faith in his squad despite disciplinary issues. "It's been a week as a coach, simple as that, preparing a team getting ready to face Australia and a team that under-performed last week against Italy," he said. "That's been the nuts and the bolts of the job this week. "I think the world of that squad, every single one of them and they will all play a part during this World Cup." McNamara became frustrated as he was questioned on disciplinary issues and said: "I'm not going to answer any more questions on it. If you want to continue asking the questions, then we'll wrap up now." McNamara briefly went on to talk about the match against Australia but ended the session abruptly when asked about Hock. Australia coach Tim Sheens denied he was pleased to see England's troubled build-up to Saturday's game in Cardiff. "I made the comment earlier in the week that an embarrassed side is a dangerous side," he said. "Anyone involved in sport understands that when things go wrong, it can have the exact reverse effect." </body>

      <title>Fifa &amp; Uefa must stop racism - Toure</title>
      <description>Yaya Toure tells the BBC it is time to let Fifa and Uefa "do their work" after accusing CSKA Moscow fans of racism.</description>

      <body>Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure says it is time to let Fifa and Uefa "do their work" after accusing CSKA Moscow fans of racism. Toure claimed he was racially abused during Wednesday's Champions League win and suggested African players might boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Asked on Friday whether a boycott was still possible, the Ivory Coast player told BBC Afrique: "We're not here yet." He added: "Let's leave Fifa and Uefa to do their work." Toure spoke to referee Ovidiu Hategan during the 2-1 win over CSKA to complain about the behaviour of the home fans, although the Russian club have denied any racist abuse took place. The Romanian official chose to do nothing at the time, but Uefa - which governs European football - has since opened disciplinary proceedings against CSKA Moscow for the "racist behaviour of their fans". "Uefa has decided to do certain things. They have decided to apply the rules. That's all we want," said Toure. "A lot of things have been said about racism. If today an organisation and supporters stray from the straight path or slip up, the goal is to set them straight again. "We are all humans. It is not a nice feeling to go and play a football match - to bring joy to the people - and to be called a monkey or to hear monkey noises. I don't look like a monkey. That's what disappoints me so much." Toure had suggested after the match in Moscow that African players might decide not to play in the 2018 World Cup if nothing was done to tackle the issue of racism. But several Premier League managers believe talk of a boycott is either wrong or at best premature. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho insists threatening the 2018 World Cup is not the way to combat racism in football and urged players not to punish "billions" for the "disgraceful behaviour" of thousands. "If I was a black player, I would say the other billions are much more important, so let's fight the thousands, but let's give to the billions what the billions want," he said. "And the billions want the best football - and the best football without black players is not the best football." Manchester United manager David Moyes believes walking off the pitch would be allowing those responsible for the behaviour to win. "It is the people who come up against the racial abuse that should really answer the question but my feeling is I don't think walking off the pitch [works]," he said. "That gives the people chanting or shouting against you what they want. "That is not the way. Sanctions have to be taken on the club, the players and other supporters who are involved." Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said Uefa must complete its investigation before there is any more talk of a boycott. "It's a bit early because it's not proven what happened," he said. Manuel Pellegrini , Toure's manager at Manchester City, urged the European governing body to act. "Uefa have the right things in place to deal with the problem and they need to deal with the issue," said the Chilean. "I hope it won't happen again." While Uefa has said it is investigating Toure's complaint, its president Michel Platini has ordered an internal investigation  to find out why proper protocol was not followed in the handling of the incident. Kick It Out  chairman Lord Ouseley said Hategan should not officiate again for failing to deal with the alleged abuse. Manchester United defender Patrice Evra fears racism will never be beaten. Evra, victim of Luis Suarez's racist comments at Anfield two years ago, told MUTV: "I don't think we will stop the racism. "Fifa have to do something because every year we hear something about racism. "I am sad even to have to talk about it." </body>

Maldonado was forced to pull off the circuit after his right-front wheel shed a nut, leading to a puncture. It came after the team were involved in a similar incident at Japanese Grand Prix a fortnight ago. Williams were then fined £60,000 and made improvements to the wheel retaining system. A FIA statement read: "The stewards decide that a fine of 60,000 Euros is the most appropriate penalty in this case taking into account that this was the second offence, but on this occasion the wheel was retained."

      <title>Why do some people prefer bitter drinks?</title>
      <description>There's been a spike in the numbers drinking Negronis and Aperol spritzes. Why are people turning their backs on sweet cocktails in favour of a bitter taste?</description>

      <body>There's been a wave of popularity for drinks like the Aperol spritz, the Negroni, and a host of cocktails flavoured with "bitters". Why are people turning their backs on sweet cocktails in favour of a bitter taste? The last two decades have seen an extraordinary resurgence in cocktail-making on both sides of the Atlantic, with everything from Cointreau-sweetened Cosmopolitans to sugary Mojitos being drunk in vast quantities. But there is now a definite trend towards bitter drinks. People are ordering whisky or gin-based drinks paired with vermouths. And there is growing interest in the US, UK and other European nations in Italian amari. These complex, herbal, bittersweet drinks, with names like Averna, Ramazzotti, Montenegro and Fernet Branca, are usually consumed as aperitivi or digestivi - drinks thought to either encourage the appetite before dinner or help with digestion afterwards. Their bitter mixer cousins, Cynar, Campari and Aperol, are increasingly being used in cocktails. Aperol - based on bitter orange and rhubarb and containing classic bitter ingredients like gentian and cinchona (a source of quinine) - has rocketed in popularity in recent years following a push by owner Gruppo Campari. Sales rose 156% in the UK in 2012 and 56% in the US. This year's figures, announced soon, are expected to be even bigger. A poster campaign in the UK encourages people to try an Aperol spritz - prosecco sparkling wine and soda water mixed with Aperol. A fundamental point of the spritz is its low alcohol content. Aperol's slogan is "poco alcolico", roughly meaning a little bit alcoholic. "I think the Aperol spritz was probably the most asked-for drink in the outdoor areas of most decent bars in London this summer," says World Duty Free mixologist Charlie McCarthy. Laura Tallo, from Nonna's Italian Cucina in Bath, says many British drinkers have returned after holidays in Italy, having seen certain drinks paired with tavola calda - the selection of hot, freshly-baked food. "People are definitely beginning to embrace the Italian custom of drinking aperitifs. We have seen a definite trend emerging of people choosing classic Italian pre-dinner drinks such as an Aperol spritz, Negroni [equal parts Campari, gin and sweet vermouth], Americano or Martini," she says. Such drinks are not to everyone's taste, of course. While many Italians have been brought up around the tradition of amari, they can baffle non-Italian palates at first taste. "They say of a Negroni the first two or three sips you despise, and after you have had two or three drinks you start to like it," says Tom Ross, bars manager of the Polpo restaurant group in London. The taste of Fernet Branca - vaguely minty but with pungent undertones of cough medicine - is so powerful that comedian Bill Cosby constructed a seven-minute anecdote around his initial horror on encountering the drink in Italy. And yet Fernet is loved by many, being drunk with cola in Argentina and - accompanied by a separate shot of ginger beer - known as the "bartender's handshake" in San Francisco. One of the first recorded definitions of a cocktail was in a New York journal in 1803, which classified it as a mixture of any "spirituous liquor", with water, sugar and "bitters", known at the time as a bittered sling. You can find the descendant of these traditional bitters (with the term typically referring to both singular and plural) in any decent bar in the UK or US. There'll be a rather unusual bottle among the others - small with a yellow top and an oversized label covered in small print. It is the world's most famous cocktail bitters, Angostura. This bitters is the key ingredient in pink gin, the traditional officers' cocktail in the Royal Navy. It's also the bedrock of famous cocktails, including the Old Fashioned, beloved of Mad Men's Don Draper, and the Manhattan. A supply shortage in 2009 caused panic throughout the world's bartending community, according to McCarthy, and prompted bartenders to start making their own. The current wave of speakeasy-type bars inspired by the prohibition years in the US, has prompted interest in traditional and hitherto forgotten cocktails. This in turn has prompted demand for more unusual bitters. Bob Petrie, of Bob's Bitters, started in 2005 when he was approached by the Dorchester Hotel to create a range. Traditional bitters are very complex, with aromatic flavours brought out from a combination of barks, roots, herbs, and spices by macerating them in alcohol. He looked at pairing them with the "botanicals" in gin, and came up with a range including cardamom, chocolate, coriander, ginger, grapefruit, lavender, liquorice, orange and mandarin, peppermint and vanilla. "Single flavours are a lot easier for the barman as it gives a lot more scope," Petrie says. "What they can do with mine is mix and match." Rochdale-born US celebrity mixologist Gary Regan is another who was prompted to make his own to replicate the orange bitters in some old cocktail recipes. "When I realised it was hard to get good ones I decided to make my own. I stole a recipe from the Gentleman's Companion of 1939. I had about four different trials and eventually got something I liked. "This shift towards bitter has been going on for eight years," Regan estimates. "[But] most bitters aren't that bitter. They taste herbal. In fact, they are a bit on the sweet side sometimes." Fee Brothers in Rochester, New York, has been making bitters since 1863, with a short break for prohibition. Joe and Ellen Fee are the fourth generation. Their 92-year-old father still regularly visits the plant. Joe Fee says there has been a marked increase in sales over the past seven years. "Just about anything can be made into a bitters. They are your spice rack behind the bar." "I am the Willy Wonka of the cocktail mixers," boasts Ellen Fee, who conjures up the new flavours. "I like to think in terms of what flavour is already bitter. Cocoa powder is bitter, cranberry is bitter. You add to that and make it more interesting." The plethora of these cocktail tinctures and potions shows the tastes of aficionados have shifted. But there are other flagbearers for a more bitter palate. Many James Bond fans attempt to recreate the Vesper Martini from Casino Royale. Bond asks for it to be made with strong gin, vodka and the bitter Kina Lillet. Lillet took out much of the bitter quinine in the 1980s and fans tend to use Cocchi Americano Italian vermouth instead. And the Queen has followed in her mother's footsteps by drinking gin and Dubonnet - the quinine-bittered French aperitif. Just a few years ago, her choice was seen as unusual. Now she's part of an established trend. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>IVF and the marketing of hope</title>
      <description>Five million babies have been born thanks to IVF. But few people talk of the many more times the treatment doesn't work, says Lisa Jardine.</description>

      <body>Five million babies have been born thanks to IVF. But few people talk of the many more times the treatment doesn't work, says Lisa Jardine, the departing chair of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. Modern medicine can achieve extraordinary feats in repairing and protecting the human body, from hip replacements to life-extending cancer treatments. But for most of us, I think, there are two areas of medical intervention that have a very special status and deserve the closest ethical attention: birth and death, the creation of life and its termination. Just such close scrutiny was given to an amazing breakthrough in the treatment of infertility - the birth of the first "test tube baby", Louise Brown, in Oldham in 1978. As further successful IVF births followed, it was quickly decided by the British government that some sort of ethical and legal oversight was needed. Treating infertility by combining egg and sperm outside the womb, and then replacing the resulting embryo in the mother, was an established clinical reality. The question was, is it ethically acceptable to carry out the procedure, and what limitations and controls should be placed upon it to satisfy public concern? In summer 1984, the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Human Fertilisation and Embryology - the Warnock Report - was published. The task of the committee had been "to examine the social, ethical and legal implications of recent, and potential developments in the field of human assisted reproduction". The report highlighted the "special status" of the human embryo, and proposed the establishment of a regulator. The legislation derived from the report continues to govern In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) in the UK 30 years later under that regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, or HFEA. PDF download The Warnock Report[770KB] Dame Mary Warnock - now Baroness Warnock - turned out to be the ideal person to steer the public moral debate on IVF. As commentator Andrew Brown wrote in 2003: "Her distrust of grand schemes and theories [made] her much in demand as a kind of philosophical plumber to the establishment - whenever some tricky problem arose, she could be trusted to get things flowing again." Born into an old-fashioned, well-to-do family, Warnock studied Classics at Oxford, and became a lecturer in philosophy at St Hugh's College in 1949. Turning her attention to schooling after the birth of her five children, she became head of Oxford High School in 1966, and spent six years championing girls' secondary education. In the 1970s, she moved into public life and began to demonstrate her considerable skills as a committee chair capable of dealing with tricky political and ethical issues. She chaired a Home Office Commission of Inquiry into the use of animals in laboratory experiments, and a government commission on the education of children with special needs. Her clear-headedness and keen intellect helped dissect the issue and structure the agenda in whatever controversial arena she engaged in. These talents were complemented by her administrative skill, and her shrewd grasp of politics. She knew which recommendations would work administratively while being politically workable too. Even she probably did not anticipate the furore the Warnock Report would cause. There was opposition from religious figures, politicians and the general public to the very practice of this way of creating new life. It is a real tribute to the care with which the report was written that eventually legislation to regulate IVF went on to the statute book, and the regulatory body to oversee it - the HFEA - was set up. "Perhaps the greatest achievement of the Warnock committee is that it managed to get an ethical consensus that people understood as well as shared," observed a former HFEA chair. The results of Warnock's astuteness are to be seen in the formal structure of the HFEA as established in 1990. It must have expert medical and scientific representation, she advised, but it ought to be led by a lay chair - someone with strong ethical beliefs, but outside the IVF sector. Each of its decision-making committees should also have a lay majority. I have served as chair of the HFEA for the past six years. Next month will be my last authority meeting. So it seems an appropriate moment to reflect on my experience in that role. I have seen at first hand how the regulation of IVF uses the most elegant features of UK regulatory legislation to best advantage. Legislation is passed which lays down a broad-brush picture of a sensitive area's activities and how they need to be monitored. Then the specialist regulator monitors those activities on a day-to-day basis - in the case of IVF, recording the details of every one of the 60,000 cycles carried out in a calendar year, inspecting and licensing clinics in both the NHS and the private sector and approving research involving embryos. In a fast-changing field, decisions on difficult or anomalous cases are taken on an individual basis, with the best available expert advice, and policy is developed to cover new techniques and circumstances as they emerge. The most important consequence of the close scrutiny the HFEA gives is that public confidence is robustly maintained, even as the possibilities given to those unable to have children naturally, but desperate to do so, expand at a giddying speed. Baroness Warnock will have been barely aware in the 1980s of clinical possibilities which now enable parents who carry a rare genetic defect to have their embryos screened, and an undamaged one selected, so that the baby will not die in infancy. She could not have imagined the technique of mitochondrial replacement - removing the nucleus from an egg with mitochondrial abnormalities, and placing it in a donor egg. Over the past two years, the HFEA has carried out a consultation process with clinicians, scientists and the public in order to advise the present government on whether this technique - which has up to now only been allowed in the research laboratory - should be introduced into clinical practice. Perhaps surprisingly, the public supported the new technique, if it could prevent serious illness. They had little objection to its being approved for clinical use, as long as it was scrupulously overseen by an appropriate regulatory body. Like any outgoing chair, there are, of course things I regret not having achieved. My personal mission when I took up the post was, inevitably given my interests, public engagement - disseminating as widely as possible both the benefits and disadvantages of all aspects of assisted reproduction. This proved to be unexpectedly difficult to do. There is an extraordinarily high level of coverage of any story involving IVF in the media - celebrity births, tales of miracle babies after years of trying, and above all, breakthroughs in clinical practice which may bring hope to thousands wishing for their own child. This is a sector that trades in hope, and the papers and women's magazines are full of encouragement. Yet the success rates for IVF remain discouragingly low. The last figures we have show that for every cycle of IVF, fewer than a third of patients will emerge with a baby (the figures are somewhat higher for women under 35). That leaves two thirds of would-be mothers and fathers with the heartbreak of "failure". And the costs are high - 60% of IVF treatment in Britain is carried out in private clinics, but the HFEA has no control over the prices charged. A couple - and nowadays that means same-sex couples as well as traditional partnerships - is likely to have spent something of the order of £15,000 for the three cycles it is likely to have taken should they be fortunate enough to become pregnant. I would have loved to have been able to have spoken more often and more publicly, with more words of caution for those proposing to undertake IVF, or postponing their family because IVF seems a reliable option should natural conception fail. Columnist Zoe Williams wrote a telling piece about the heartache of unsuccessful treatment last month, headlined Where's all the grief going? But newspapers today want banner headlines and excitement. Public information is nowhere on their agenda. Try as I might, I have not been able to talk at length to all those families out there who are about to enter the world of IVF, or who are undergoing treatment and being persuaded to try again and again when it fails, or who are entering their 40s and hoping IVF will allow them to start a late family. The world of IVF is a market, a market in hope. Those who enter it deserve to be fully informed of its potential to deliver grief and a sense of failure, as well as success.

      <body>Welcome to The Loop, the Magazine's letters column, including the best of your thoughts from Twitter and Facebook. Readers will, we hope, excuse confusion on our part this week when we saw this tweet from Noel Lynch. He wrote: "A lion tamer friend of mine once told me that lion urine works very well." But what was he referring to? Something to do with how to deter foxes from your garden, perhaps? The Magazine spoke to a fox expert who specialises in removing them in ways that will not harm the animal. They call it "humane deterrence" and don't like to be labelled as pest controllers. The trick is to disturb the wily creatures' normal behaviour. The piece singularly failed to discuss how one might humanely collect lion urine, however. So we thought perhaps the tip was something about how to deal with problematic housemates, as the Magazine had also noted that the high cost of rent in the UK forces many people into multiple-person houseshares. Avoiding picking a duff housemate can be tricky, but there could be a few signs to look out for. @Philly_Spurr: "If they come to view a flat with their annoying partner and casually enquire about a double bed, its a no go!" Housemates' partners can be trouble makers, as John Morris pointed out: "I shared a house with two girls in Shooters Hill in the 1970s. One day I came home and one of the girl's boyfriends had adorned the living room and hall with posters for the Socialist Workers' Party. I left." Amy Wilson for Leamington Spa is having a much more positive experience, though. "I currently live in a house share with 20 other people. Our little community comprises international students, young professionals and the odd nutter. The biggest thing I have learnt is compromise. The kitchens may not always be clean and food goes missing, but the experience of living with so many different people and cultures makes up for it tenfold. I have learnt so much from the people I live with I can forgive the odd mouldy cup!" After pondering Noel's tweet at length, we thought it might be referring to the story about exotic pastries - a new generation of French pastry chefs are reinventing their craft with audacious creations. Anyone for a caramel popcorn, pistachio orange or pecan eclair, or an olive-oil macaroon with mandarin orange and cucumber water? Perhaps these new flavours are crying out for a secret ingredient. Ingredients - particularly bitter ones - are popular with drinks such as the Aperol spritz, the Negroni, and a host of cocktails flavoured with "bitters". The taste of Negronis was the subject of a conversation by readers on Facebook. Could someone please help Sanjeev Prakash out? "Alright, I 'fess: I like Campari as an aperitif, but what the blazes is a Negroni..? Gin +______?" Jane Shepherd, perhaps, who loves Negronis. "When I was 23 I came back from an Italian break with a bottle of Campari, a drink I'd enjoyed in Rome and Sorrento. Instead of sipping it sedately and making it last, I made a big bucket of Negroni (not so easy on the gin) with my flatmates and felt no pain whatsoever." One thing we know a Negroni is not made from is lion urine. C'mon Noel Lynch, help us out here. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>A spat between two former Conservative leaders continues after Iain Duncan Smith mocked Sir John Major's support for a "cones hotline" in the 1990s. Relations between the two men have been cool ever since Mr Duncan Smith led opposition to Sir John over the Maastricht Treaty on EU integration. On Tuesday, Sir John took a swipe at Mr Duncan Smith's welfare reforms, saying his "genius was unproven". Now Mr Duncan Smith has hit back in an interview in the Evening Standard. Asked about Sir John's comments, Mr Duncan Smith told the newspaper. "Well, as I say, I never really get too fussed about what people think about their own intellects. "I'm always happy to be in awe of someone whose own intellect delivered us the cones hotline, I must say." The cones hotline - a telephone number for motorists to ring if they were irritated by unattended road works - was one of the most mocked policies of the Major government. A source close to Mr Duncan Smith insisted to the BBC it was a throw away line and meant as a joke. There has been little love lost between the two men since, as a backbencher in the early 1990s, Mr Duncan Smith was one of a group of rebels who fought a long parliamentary campaign against the Major government's decision to sign up to the Maastricht Treaty - regarded as a landmark moment in European integration. The battles, which resulted in the Major government facing a confidence vote in the House of Commons, undermined Sir John's authority and led to the prime minister calling his opponents "bastards". He repeated the phrase in a speech to an audience of political journalists on Tuesday, saying his use of the word was "unacceptable" but "his only excuse was that it was true". In the speech, Sir John also questioned the likely outcome of Mr Duncan Smith's sweeping programme of welfare changes. "Iain Duncan Smith is trying to reform benefits," he said. "I truly wish him well. But it is enormously complicated and unless he is very lucky, which he may not be, or a genius, which the last time I looked was unproven, he may get some of it wrong." Mr Duncan Smith's Universal Credit is seen as one of the most ambitious, and potentially risky, policies the coalition has embarked upon. Chancellor George Osborne has denied reports in a recent book by the journalist Matthew D'Ancona that he had questioned whether Mr Duncan Smith had the intelligence to run a major department like work and pensions. Referring to the matter recently at the Tory conference, Mr Duncan Smith pointed out that both Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher had had their intellect questioned but had proved their doubters wrong. And Mr Duncan Smith told the Evening Standard on Friday: "I never make any claims for myself, I just say I think we should all look at each other and be a little more pleasant." </body>

      <title>Cost of ministers' advisers up £1m</title>
      <description>The cost of political special advisers has risen by £1m in the last year, official figures reveal.</description>

      <body>The salary bill for ministers' special advisers has risen by £1m in the last year, according to official figures. So-called "Spads" are appointed by ministers to provide political advice over and above the impartial work carried out by civil servants. The Cabinet Office put the increase down to the "unusual" pressures caused by coalition government. But Labour said David Cameron's pre-election promise to limit the number of special advisers was in "tatters". A leap from 85 to 98 in the number of special advisers - who work directly to ministers and often speak for them - contributed to a 16% rise in the total wage bill in 2012-13. According to the Cabinet Office, the total salary bill was £7.2m last year, up from £6.2m in 2011-12 and more than the previous government spent in its final year. Special advisers played "an important role... advising ministers and contributing to the smooth running of government", a spokesman said. "This is particularly important in a coalition and the number of special advisers reflects the unusual circumstances of this government - the first coalition government for more than 60 years." He added that special advisers represented 2.2% of the senior civil service. But Labour MP Phil Wilson accused the prime minister of breaking his 2010 manifesto pledge to "put a limit on the number of special advisers". "While he tells the rest of the country to accept cuts, he's happy to spend more and more on his own spin doctors. It's more evidence of how out of touch he is that he thinks the rules don't apply to him," he added. </body>

      <title>US spying 'may harm terror fight'</title>
      <description>EU leaders meeting in Brussels say distrust of the US over spying could harm intelligence-gathering in the fight against terrorism.</description>

      <body>EU leaders meeting in Brussels said distrust of the US over spying could harm the fight against terrorism. A statement agreed by the leaders said that "a lack of trust could prejudice" intelligence-gathering co-operation. German spy chiefs are travelling to Washington next week to press for action over the alleged monitoring of Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone. Both Germany and France want talks with the US to find a new "understanding" by the end of the year. As well as the bugging of Mrs Merkel's phone, there are claims the US National Security Agency (NSA) has monitored millions of telephone calls by both German and French citizens. Spain on Friday followed Germany and France in summoning the US ambassador to explain reports of spying on the country. The UK's Guardian newspaper has reported that it obtained a confidential memo from the NSA suggesting it had monitored the phones of 35 world leaders. The latest revelations have been sourced to US whistleblower Edward Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who fled the country earlier this year and is now in Russia. US state department spokesperson Jen Psaki said a review of US intelligence gathering, called for by President Obama, would look at how it affects foreign policy. The "high level group of outside experts... will consider as part of this how we can maintain the public's trust, how the surveillance impacts our foreign policy, particularly in an age when more and more information is becoming public," she said. The EU leaders' statement, released earlier on Friday, reflected their conclusions following talks on Thursday. It said the recent intelligence issues had raised "deep concerns" among European citizens. The statement said the leaders "underlined the close relationship between Europe and the USA and the value of that partnership". "[The leaders] stressed that intelligence-gathering is a vital element in the fight against terrorism," it continued. And it went on: "A lack of trust could prejudice the necessary cooperation in the field of intelligence-gathering." "The heads of state or government took note of the intention of France and Germany to seek bilateral talks with the USA with the aim of finding before the end of the year an understanding on mutual relations in that field," the leaders' statement also said. "They noted that other EU countries are welcome to join this initiative." French President Francois Hollande said the aim of the initiative "is about knowing about the past and setting a framework for the future and putting an end to monitoring mechanisms that are not controlled". Germany and France said they are proposing talks with the US to settle the row by the end of the year. But Mrs Merkel stressed Berlin and Paris would be making their own separate approaches to Washington. BBC Europe editor Gavin Hewitt says the French and Germans are looking for a new set of rules with a "no spying pact" at the core. He says this would mirror an arrangement the United States has had with Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada since just after World War II. That secret intelligence-sharing operation is known as Five Eyes. Mrs Merkel said she did not know the exact details of the Five Eyes arrangement so could not say whether that is exactly what Germany is seeking, but added: "We need something clear-cut, in line with the spirit of an alliance". UK Prime Minister David Cameron acknowledged the UK's "unique partnership" with the US regarding security but said: "I understand what others want to do and support that, as I think does President Obama". When asked by the BBC if the US had ever monitored Mr Cameron's phone, White House National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said: "His communications have not, are not and will not be monitored by the US." 'Look to the future' The spying revelations have overshadowed other issues at the EU summit in Brussels, including the Mediterranean migration problem, which framed the agenda of Friday's talks. Italian authorities said they had intercepted some 800 migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean as the EU leaders prepared to meet. A number leaders indicated their support for the French and German position. Belgian Prime Minister Elio di Rupo said: "The objective must remain the same - to fight against terrorism but also respect privacy. "Everyone can understand the need for exceptional measures given the danger of terrorism... but we are not in the position where we should spy on each other." Swedish PM Fredrik Reinfeldt said it was "completely unacceptable" to eavesdrop on the leader of an ally, a view echoed by Italian PM Enrico Letta, who added: "We want the truth." Other leaders signalled the need to move on. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said: "The main thing is that we look to the future. The trans-Atlantic partnership was, and is, important." Mrs Merkel had raised her concerns with US President Barack Obama in a call on Wednesday. White House spokesman Jay Carney later said Mr Obama had assured Mrs Merkel that her phone was not being listened to now and would not be in the future. However, his statement left open the question of whether calls had been listened to in the past. </body>

Paula Harriott, who spent four years in jail for supplying drugs, believes the so called "resettlement prisons" will help prevent children of prisoners from falling into crime. The mother of five told BBC Radio 5 live's Breakfast: "I knew that my children were suffering intensely and having to cope with not having a mum... they were the innocent victims of my bad parenting." "Children of imprisoned parents are are more likely to get into the criminal justice system... and if we can do stuff that enables those children to escape that destiny that's better for the community as a whole." </body>

      <description>Why world leaders don't like using secure phones</description>

      <body>The most common reaction to news that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged by the US National Security Agency appears to be world-weary resignation. Followed by a sly suggestion that someone of her experience and stature should have known better. Kurt Volker, former US ambassador to Nato 2008-2009, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme "every country spies" and he could not believe that the revelations were a surprise to anyone. Lord West, a security minister under Gordon Brown, said he had "always worked on the assumption" that people were listening to his phone calls. "I know they jolly well were," he told Today. "I don't think it's surprising that people try and listen. If you are a head of state there are lots of people, not just other states, who are listening. "There are companies, all sorts of people, who want to hear what you are saying and I think you have to be extremely careful." A former senior British diplomat, who did not want to be named, told the BBC News website he always worked on the assumption that his phone calls were being listened to. This could sometimes be turned to the British delegation's advantage, he explained, by reinforcing the message that they were trying to get across in negotiations in supposedly private phone conversations, knowing full well that they would be intercepted. But at the same time, it was worth remembering when reading reports of what the representatives of other nations were saying that they were probably up to the same game, he added. Former Home Secretary David Blunkett recently revealed that Nicolas Sarkozy, the then French interior minister, tried to save time in negotiations over the closure of the Sangatte transit camp by saying he already knew the British position because the French secret service had intercepted unencrypted Home Office emails. But not everyone is quite so sanguine. Clare Short, who made headlines and provoked fury in Downing Street in 2004 when she revealed that the British secret service had bugged the office and telephone of then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, says she was genuinely "shocked" by the Merkel revelations. The former international development secretary also rejects the argument that Mrs Merkel's anger is for the benefit of the German public, many of whom are still haunted by the memory of the Stasi. "I am sure she was very angry and upset. These were her friends and now [she finds] they don't trust her," says Ms Short. Ms Short said she was regularly given intelligence reports about what Mr Annan was saying in the supposed privacy of his office but she became increasingly uncomfortable about this in the run-up to the Iraq war. She recalls the surreal and disturbing experience of chatting to Kofi Annan on her mobile phone and realising that someone would probably be listening in and transcribing every word. She says she can not recall any examples of being handed intelligence reports about what friendly powers were saying to each other on the phone during her time in office, from 1997 to 2003. But she says she was approached by "successive Cs" - the code name for the head of MI6 - offering to spy on the leaders of friendly nations in Africa. "I told them, 'No of course not. We don't want to spy on the people we are working with,'" she tells the BBC News website. She also explodes one popular myth about notorious technophobe Tony Blair - that he did not carry a mobile phone during his years in power. "I don't really believe that," she says, adding that it might be part of Downing Street myth-making: "It makes him more emperor-like." All heads of state, in the Western world at least, will have access to encrypted mobile phones and other secure lines. The problem, for security staff, is convincing world leaders to take the espionage threat seriously. Shortly after taking office in 2008, Barack Obama managed to convince the secret service to let him keep his own Blackberry, despite fears it would broadcast his location and make him vulnerable to hacking. Mr Obama is said to be frustrated about having to live in the White House "bubble", cut off from the outside world and unable to communicate with normal people. The President's Blackberry is often seen on his belt and he is sometimes pictured scrolling through his messages as he travels in his limousine. In France, senior officials have access to a secure intranet and phone network - but the country's leaders are reported to be reluctant to use the slow and restrictive system, which can take up to 30 seconds to place a call. President Francois Hollande is said to have followed predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy by holding on to his personal smartphone. Mobile phones are banned in No 10 - you have to hand them in at the door - over fears foreign powers are listening in. All calls in and out are routed through a secure switchboard staffed by officials - a system which continues when the prime minister is travelling. Downing Street is remaining tight-lipped about the latest bugging revelations. Asked earlier if the prime minister was still using his mobile phone, Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: "I haven't seen him use a different one". </body>

      <title>Does football need early kick-offs?</title>
      <description>Do early kick-offs really help prevent football violence?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-24606069</url>

      <body>This weekend Sunderland play Newcastle United for the first time since more than 100 fans were arrested after trouble following a game last season. Like that fixture, Sunday's match will kick off earlier than many fans would like, but do early starts still prevent violence? April's Tyne-Wear derby at St James' Park will be remembered for events both on and off the pitch. Sunderland won on Tyneside for the first time in almost 13 years and the aftermath of the game is still making its way through the courts. Several Newcastle fans received prison sentences, including one man who was jailed for a year after he admitted punching a police horse, and two 12-year-old boys are now among the youngest in the country to have football banning orders. It came as some surprise to fans, then, when Sunday's match between the fierce rivals was originally scheduled for 16:00 GMT by Sky Sports, but no one connected to either club was shocked when the kick-off was brought forward to 13:30 for safety reasons. Early kick-offs are unpopular with fans attending games and some have questioned whether they still serve their purpose of reducing drinking time. Kevin Miles from the Football Supporters' Federation said he was "yet to be convinced" the measure was still relevant. "The fact is that once you give agencies like the police additional powers of this kind, they'll be very reluctant to relinquish them," he said. "From what I can see there appears to be little correlation between the time a game starts and the numbers of arrests made, especially at derby games. "The last Tyne-Wear derby was an early kick-off, yet the number of arrests was among the highest ever. Added to that was the fact the less than 10% of those arrested had actually attended the game." Home Office statistics released this month revealed more Newcastle fans had been arrested than any other club during the 2012-13 season, with the figure vastly inflated by the trouble following Sunderland's 3-0 win on Tyneside in April. The figures showed football arrests had risen by 4% but the number of fans held for alcohol-related issues was down from 800 to 549 year-on-year. Geoff Pearson from Liverpool University has researched the impact of alcohol restrictions on football crowds and found fans observed in a study would go to "extraordinary lengths" to overcome "practical and legal measures". He said early kick-offs did reduce the alcohol consumed, although perhaps not as much as police forces would like. "Fans will start earlier, but if you have a 17:30 kick-off, fans belonging to that drinking sub-culture are going to drink for about five hours before the game, whereas if you had a midday kick-off, they're not going to be drinking for as long. "They might start at 10:00 maybe, but they're not going to be consuming the same amount. "What does happen is that over the course of the day an early kick-off means there's going to be more drinking time in total." Mr Pearson said early kick-offs could lead to volatile situations for "same city derbies" where fans would mix long after the game Fans on either side of the Wear-Tyne divide point to relaxed licensing laws as an example of why the measure may now have less of an impact than in the past. Gary Stephens, a former chairman of Sunderland's fan liaison group, believes early kick-offs should be scrapped. "They absolutely do not work", he said. "As far as drinking goes, you can't stop it. Pubs can open whenever they want, now that we've got 24 hour drinking. But even if they didn't, people can simply go to the supermarket, get tanked up and still cause trouble." Of its 384 licensed premises, Sunderland Council said 67 were able to serve alcohol before 11:00 BST. It has rejected one temporary application to serve from 08:00 BST on Sunday after objections from police. Northumbria Police's operations commander for Sunday's game Ch Supt Steve Neill said "public safety and the welfare of fans" was the "absolute priority". "We sometimes seek earlier kick-off times for the derby to reduce the length of time people have to consume alcohol and to help prevent the likelihood of crime and disorder," he said. Mark Jensen, editor of Newcastle fanzine The Mag, said he had not found any football fan that had "anything to say" for early kick-offs. "It's crazy in this day and age that a crowd of around 50,000 can be inconvenienced just because of the risk a small minority might cause trouble. "When there's so much money in football and the police have CCTV and all their other resources it does seem mad that you can't have a match after a certain time. "Police will always play the public order card but after the match at St James' Park in April that seems to have been blown out of the water." Ch Supt Neill said the police priority was for "supporters to be able to enjoy the game". He will join fans of both clubs in hoping Sunday's talking points are generated purely on the field. </body>

      <body>It is reputedly the most haunted highway in Scotland. The A75 in Dumfriesshire is said to have had more reports of supernatural activity than any other road in the country. Now a Dumfries-based group of paranormal investigators has collated the stories for a ghostly Halloween road trip on Saturday night. The Kinmount straight on the road is the most notorious spot for sightings. John Hill, of Mostly Ghostly paranormal investigators, said: "So much has happened at this spot. "A quick search of the internet would bring up the A75 as the most haunted road in Scotland and some say Britain. "There are so many different things have happened on this road and been seen by so many different people as well." Mr Hill and Mostly Ghostly founder Kathleen Cronie have researched the road's supernatural history to compile the first ever ghost coach tour of the road. They have some spine-chilling accounts to relate. "There have been screaming hags, eyeless phantoms and a menagerie of unearthly creatures witnessed on this famous road," said Ms Cronie. She said one of the most infamous sightings was made by Derek and Norman Ferguson, in 1962. "They were driving along here and the whole incident began with a large hen flying towards the windscreen of their car," she said. "They then witnessed great cats and various other creatures as well as witnessing a phantom furniture van - which is a bit unusual to say the least." Bob Sturgeon lives beside the A75 and used to run a roadside snack van - at Carrutherstown, near to the sighting "hotspot". "There was very rarely a week went past without somebody telling me about some experience and usually along that Kinmount straight," he said. His business was a frequent early morning refuge for traumatised lorry drivers who had parked overnight in nearby lay-bys. "They weren't the kind of people who would talk to each other," he explained. "They were long-distance drivers - they were well separated - so it wasn't as if there was a group of them gathered in a pub and passed round stories. "Most of these things were all just individual experiences." A common sighting was groups of dejected bedraggled people pulling handcarts or carrying bundles like some medieval camp followers. One man was so shocked, he gave up lorry driving altogether and Mr Sturgeon never saw him again. "He had been parked on the Kinmount straight and he had woken up at the back of three in the morning and he saw this 'parade' of people," he said. "He said that it went on for ages and he had just frozen - he was in an awful state. "It doesn't matter if you blame it on imagination or fact or whatever, it certainly affected him badly." Documented reports of ghosts on this road go back at least 50 years. As well as seeing assorted animals, horsemen and carriages, some drivers have been convinced they have run over people - phantom figures of men, women, couples emerging from the dark. Saturday night's ghost tour is for Halloween but it is likely to be repeated several times a year, for those with the stomach to listen to the stories and the nerve to face the possibility of a spooky experience of their own. </body>

      <title>The iconic voices of technology</title>
      <description>Meeting the faces behind technology's most iconic voices</description>

      <body>Millions of people hear their voices every day - but would you recognise them if you saw them walking down the street? Well maybe now you will. The BBC met the faces behind four of the most famous and iconic voices heard in technology today. Siri, Apple's voice-powered personal assistant, made its debut in June 2010. Since then, millions of the devices with the feature have been sold worldwide. In the UK, the voice you will hear responding to commands belongs to Jon Briggs, an illustrious voiceover artist whose portfolio includes the likes of the Weakest Link, Radio 2 and Channel 4. Jon had offered up his voice to a firm that specialises in computer-generated speech - that is, taking Jon's voice but moulding it to say virtually any possible phrase. Apple, when creating Siri, picked out Jon - unbeknownst to him. "I discovered that I was being used as the voice of Siri when Rory Cellan-Jones, the BBC technology correspondent, suddenly started demonstrating it on BBC Breakfast. "I thought 'I recognise that voice!', and so it was true - and it's a slightly bizarre journey since then." It means that while his voice is now being played out countless times a day all over the country, Apple has not paid him - he only received the fee earned he when recording the original material. But, he says he's excited to be "in early" on what he believes is changing how we use technology. "You can take a photograph of your desk - there is a screen a keyboard and a mouse. "You will show it to your children or your grandchildren and they will laugh and go 'you had a thing called a mouse? What's that funny thing with letters on?'" In contrast to the received pronunciation of her "Tube" voice, Emma Clarke's speaking voice is in fact Northern - growing up, as she did, in Sale near Manchester. Her voice can be heard across the Bakerloo, Central and District lines of London's iconic Underground network. The process of getting the job was long and painstaking - months of focus groups and whittling down possible candidates. During the selection, each possible voice was given a codename. Emma's, apparently, was 'Marilyn'. "Had they named me 'Brenda' I'm not sure I'd have got the gig," she jokes. She now gets fan mail from all over the world, particularly from Texas. "People initially thought I was actually on the train!" she says, "Or in some kind of central control room. I don't know where they thought it was." She says she is proud to lend her voice to the network, but adds that she hopes some of the lines she recorded never have to be heard by the public. "There were a couple of emergency announcements, that I remember when I read them on the script I thought 'oh god, imagine how these people will feel when they hear these announcements. "I felt such a sense of responsibility, of calming people down." Unlike the other voices in this piece, Terry Green is the only one who doesn't consider his voice to be his profession. He found his way to audio fame indirectly. He specialises in customer service, and the systems used in shops to get things moving and punters through the tills. And so it was, when the company he was working for needed a male voice to beckon people to the till, he stepped forward: "Cashier number three, please..." "We just sat down with a digital voice recorder, laid down the track, and that was it! I was on the prototype system, and then suddenly rolled out to 8,000 shops." They recorded up to cashier number 25 - but now the system goes much further. Indeed, around the world, the company's technology is used in thousands of stores - although with local voices instead of Terry's. Now he makes his living as a leading expert on the study of shoppers' behaviour. "My voice was on all these systems that we were rolling out, so I was becoming more and better known. I started writing white papers, and eventually I came to write a book." One morning, Sara Mendes da Costa was listening to Terry Wogan on Radio 2 when he mentioned that a competition would be held to find the new voice of the Speaking Clock. "A little bell rang in my head and I went 'oooh!'" She wasn't alone - within moments she had had calls friends and family saying she should put herself forward. She won, and from 2007 she took over the voice of the Speaking Clock, which is called up approximately 60 million times each year. It was a job she was excited, but nervous, to take on. "Brian Cobby, who sadly passed away last year, had the most beautiful, rich, Shakespearian voice. "Then I came along - I have visions of people going 'oh...'!" "But they wanted something different, someone a bit more of the moment, a little bit more who we are now." Sara uses the Speaking Clock regularly in her day-to-day work, and admits she just can't resist listening to each and every word. "I listen until when it goes through to 'precisely' - and only then I can hang up! "It's just a weird thing that I've got." Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <title>Liz West: An artist with extra Spice</title>
      <description>How a Spice Girls obsession helped an art career</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24655947</url>

      <body>Artist Liz West is gaining a glowing reputation for her colour-drenched light installations - but her art career might not have taken off if it were not for her world-record collection of Spice Girls memorabilia. Art and pop can go hand-in-hand, she explains. West is taking part in two exhibitions this week - one featuring her strips of coloured light radiating from the corner of an old warehouse, which is in the Synthesis exhibition as part of Manchester Science Festival. She has a growing reputation as a contemporary artist thanks to her arrangements of lights in precise, pleasing patterns and her collections of objects bathed in bright, bold hues. For the other exhibition, she has lent some of the 5,000 Spice Girls items she has amassed since the age of 11, including branded clothes, crisp packets and a clock, to an exhibition celebrating 40 years of Virgin Records in London. As well as being an artist, West holds the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of Spice Girls memorabilia. "The way I see it is that installation art is high culture and Spice Girls is pop culture," she says. "Although the two hold hands, they're separate." When looking to launch her art career, West's Spice Girls obsession came in useful when she found she could get paid for loaning her girl-powered pop collection to museums, film crews and events. "Because I was given that financial boost to start with, my art practice has been able to roll and roll," she says. "Now I'm able to fund my art practice through my art. I don't have to work in Starbucks part-time. A lot of artists do have to work part-time, and I think that would kill any creativity for me. It really would." West was born into the art world - almost literally - almost born on the floor of the Whitworth Gallery in Manchester, she says, when her mother Jenny was artist in residence there 28 years ago. A five-day-old West attended the opening of her mother's exhibition. When she was seven years old, West remembers putting nail varnish bottles on a bedroom shelf in line according to their colour. It is not difficult to spot a link between her love of colour as a child and the artworks she now creates. Then when she was 11, the Spice Girls arrived. "A very impressionable age, I think," she says. "I was hooked. The colour, the energy, the different personalities. That appealed - more so probably than the music." When the Spice Girls' second album came out in 1997, West decided to collect any and every recording and item of memorabilia she could get her hands on. "I'd go to the pound shop and buy bags of things as a 13- or 14-year-old. They brought out the dolls and I went to London to the Hamleys sale. "Of course, when eBay appeared when I was 18, I had a student loan, went a bit mad, and it just continued." Influenced by her parents (her father Steve is also an artist), West attended the prestigious Glasgow School of Art. "When I was a student, I'd go into the studio all day and then I'd go into the library in the evening and just bid and bid and bid [on eBay]," she says. "I'd have a day of art and an evening of Spice." West says she has spent "tens of thousands" of pounds on her collection, which also includes outfits from the Brit Awards, the Spiceworld movie and the jacket Mel B wore to meet Nelson Mandela. But it does not include the most iconic Spice outfit of them all - Geri Halliwell's union jack dress from the 1997 Brit Awards. That was bought by the Hard Rock Cafe in Las Vegas for £41,000. "That's the holy grail," West says. "And it's in storage. That's quite upsetting." Now, West's art career is taking off thanks to her luminous installations that look like she has dismantled and rearranged a rainbow. "Did you see the rainbow the other day over Manchester?" she says excitedly at the mention of rainbows. "This was a double one and it was a proper arch. I stopped in the street for about five minutes and stared at it. "I thought, forget James Turrell and Olafur Eliasson and all the artists that I absolutely love - this is true absolute beauty. There's something in that that I could never create, even if I tried." West says she is not worried about her Spice Girls obsession undermining her reputation as an artist. "It's completely in keeping with my personality," she says. "And because I've got such a passion for it, I win people over with that passion. It's not just about T-shirts and dollies. "As a serious artist, this is my career. I want to be nominated for the Turner Prize. "If you look at other artists, there are quite a few that have quirky collections out there and haven't hidden them. I don't have a problem with it." What do other artists say when they find out about the collection? "They think it's quite funny," West replies. "You know, it would be really boring if I didn't do anything else. People tend to think that it's a quirk, and quite a nice one." </body>

      <title>The area of outstanding beauty remade by man</title>
      <description>Should our forests be managed or left entirely to nature?</description>

      <body>A year after the first case of ash dieback in mature woodland - and with the disease spreading inexorably - experts are looking at ways to future-proof forests. Stroll around the Woodland Trust's Hucking estate (pictured in satellite views, above) near Maidstone in Kent and you could be forgiven for thinking little has changed in centuries. Sheep graze on the swathes of grassland between the gentle chalk hills. Pockets of ancient woodland carpet the hilltops and valleys. In reality, however, this seemingly timeless rural landscape is in constant flux and the effects of ash dieback will soon be all too apparent. Trees on the estate show the hallmarks of the disease in the black, shrivelled leaves hanging from the branches of diminutive seedlings and the magnificent ash trees that tower above. Ash dieback is spreading fast in this Area of Outstanding Beauty known as the Kent Downs, with trees bearing the scars of the chalara fungus. "See that lovely big ash up there," says site manager Clive Steward, pointing out a huge tree in a patch of ancient woodland. "Underneath it - see the big wide leaves - that's sycamore. It's just waiting to take over really. Because that's what will happen." Nature is poised to fill in the gaps if - as experts predict - millions of native ash trees die. Britain's forests have been through much turmoil in modern times, from the harvesting of timber for the shipbuilding industry to the arrival of pathogens such as Dutch elm disease in the 1970s. But the current speed of change is alarming ecologists. They say trees are facing unprecedented threats, with a recent increase in findings of new pests and diseases. Many believe it is only a matter of time before threats such as the emerald ash borer beetle, which drills into the trunks of ash trees, reach our shores. In an age of global trade and travel, rather than trying to stop these invaders, the key to safeguarding forests could be to closely manage them - and plant them to be resilient to future threats, be they a new pest, a violent storm, or climate change. Austin Brady of woodland conservation charity the Woodland Trust says to give a wood resilience a range of native species need to be planted, so if a pathogen strikes, at least some of the trees will survive. "For future healthy forests we need forests to have a wider range of native species growing there, so that all our eggs aren't in one basket," says Mr Brady. "So that if a particular pest and disease or issue comes along it won't destroy the whole forest. It might take out some of the components but there'll be enough different species of trees in there for the forest to survive." Maintaining diversity in the age of trees is also important, he says, as is maintaining connections between woods to give wildlife the space to thrive. The Hucking estate is seen as a pioneer of the idea of resilient woodland. A few decades ago, before the estate was taken over by the Woodland Trust, much of it was arable farmland, dotted with patches of ancient woodland. Careful management and planning has restored the natural landscape, with new trees planted to create corridors of habitat for animals and birds to roam. A mixture of native trees were used, which stand a better chance of withstanding tree diseases that are moving around the world. Mr Brady sees the practice as trying to "mimic nature". But some believe management in this way is artificial, and that nature will find its own level. Naturalist and writer Richard Mabey argues catastrophes like tree diseases are natural events, from which woods will recover without intervention. "Woody vegetation responds, adapts, regroups," he wrote in the New Statesmen. "What emerges in its recovery stage may not be the same as before, but it will always be a vital, dynamic, arboreal community. The same process will happen with ash, perhaps more quickly than we think." Joan Weber of Forest Research, agrees that "nature will fill in the gaps," as it did when elms disappeared, but this is more difficult when one particular species is dominant in a woodland. Austin Brady, however, says Britain's countryside has lost the great, untamed forests still present in countries such as Poland, with a corresponding loss of diversity. "You could make an argument for saying, let's leave forests to nature," he says. "The trouble is - we stopped leaving forests to nature in this country about 2,000 years ago. So we can't suddenly now say let's leave them to nature... we've taken away all the support systems that nature would have had in place." Others question exactly what resilience means. Managing a wood land to guard against the effects of tree diseases will not necessarily help other wildlife in the area, says Ray Dawes of the National Trust . "If you are going to change the tree species you are going to change the wildlife," says Mr Dawes, who believes the prescription for a healthy woodland varies. The National Trust has 400 properties with significant amounts of woodland in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and they are all different. "It's looking at individual woods - their origins, their values and the threats to them," he says. Back at the Hucking estate, Clive Steward spreads out an ordnance survey map over the bonnet of his dusty estate car to point out lanes in the Sussex and Kent weald that were carved by ancient farmers running pigs through the forests. Ash trees have left their mark on the map, recorded in names like Ashford and Asholt Wood. Local conservationists are preparing to record the impact of the ash tree on the landscape from a cultural perspective, in case it is lost. Nick Johannsen, director of the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, grew up during the era of Dutch elm disease, and remembers it well. "It's going to be a longer, slower, more lingering loss than elm was," he says. "But already beautiful ash trees are a shadow of themselves." Ash has long been part of our heritage, he says, used for the framework of early aircraft such as the De Havilland Mosquito, and tennis racquets at Wimbledon. "Not only is it extraordinary in its landscape and its wildlife importance - its natural heritage - it's also part of the cultural heritage of Britain. That's what we want to celebrate - because we are losing ash trees." </body>

      <body>The Guardian digests the latest US spying revelations. It gives details of the memo, leaked by the former intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, that suggests the phone conversations of 35 world leaders were monitored. According to the paper, the document acknowledges that the eavesdropping produced "little reportable intelligence". The Guardian says any intelligence benefit to the US is being far outweighed by the potential diplomatic damage. Not everyone is sympathetic towards the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, who has complained about her phone being monitored. Spy expert Nigel West, writing in the Daily Telegraph, questions whether she protests too much. He argues that she cannot pretend to be surprised because she will have authorised similar operations herself. The Financial Times expresses support for European measures designed to prevent US internet companies from being complicit in government snooping. It argues that "freedom from unwarranted surveillance should not be a privilege enjoyed by American citizens alone". The Daily Express leads with the decision of the Portuguese police to re-open its inquiry into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, claiming "vital clues" have been found. The Daily Mirror also puts the story on its front page, reporting that detectives are searching for a gang of five people. There is a warning in the Times that the plan to replace thousands of full-time soldiers with Army reservists may have to be reversed. It comes from former Defence Secretary Liam Fox. He believes it will become more difficult to recruit and retain them as the economy recovers. But the Ministry of Defence says it is committed to the plan, insisting there is no evidence it would be threatened by economic growth. The papers give an insight into the thinking of Prince Charles, drawing on a profile being published in Time magazine. The story forms the lead for the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph which both claim that Charles fears he will no longer be able to pursue those things he believes in once he becomes king. The Times says the prince sees his life's work in what he is doing now - championing causes such as sustainability and traditional architecture. According to the Telegraph, the prince thinks his environmental campaigns will benefit future generations such as that of his own grandson, Prince George. Almost all the papers carry the tale of Tracy Kenny who has claimed £100,000 worth of benefits over the course of 20 years because, she says, she is allergic to shoes. The former baker, who is 45 and from Eccles near Manchester, has now been ruled fit for work by the Department for Work and Pensions - and told that her employment support benefit will be withdrawn. It is reported that she suffers from contact dermatitis - a type of eczema that causes red, itchy skin. She says she can only wear shoes for 15 minutes before her feet blister and she questions how she can go to job interviews with no shoes on. The Daily Express thinks the benefit cut is right, arguing taxpayers should not have to support her. But the National Eczema Society says many people do not understand how painful severe eczema can be. </body>

      <title>Grangemouth plant to stay open</title>
      <description>The Grangemouth petrochemical plant near Falkirk is to stay open after a new deal was struck with workers.</description>

      <body>Political leaders and unions have welcomed news that the Grangemouth petrochemical plant is to stay open after a deal was struck with workers. Operator Ineos had announced on Wednesday that the plant was to shut, with the loss of 800 jobs, after union members rejected a survival plan. But the decision was reversed after the union agreed to Ineos's conditions. Ineos founder and chairman Jim Ratcliffe said it was "a victory for common sense". He confirmed Ineos would now press ahead with plans to invest £300m in a new gas terminal at the site, following a "significant change in attitude" from the Unite union. He added: "We have had assurances from the union yesterday that the changes we have requested in order for us to invest in that facility have been agreed and we are delighted to announce that Grangemouth will restart today, both the refining and petrochemicals side." The announcement on Grangemouth's future was greeted by huge cheers from the workforce, who had gathered at the plant to be told the news. The move brings to an end a bitter dispute with the Unite union which began over the alleged mistreatment of a Unite official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but Ineos shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a survival plan, which was initially rejected by union members. Reacting to the announcement, Unite Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said: "Relief will ring right round the Grangemouth community, and across Scotland today. "Hundreds of jobs that would have been lost can now be saved and £300m will be invested into the plant." The main points of the Ineos announcement included: First Minister Alex Salmond described the development as a "tremendous fillip for the workforce and the whole Grangemouth community, following what could have been a potential disaster". He said it had been "a great team effort from all concerned", including the unions and workforce, the management and governments. "I am delighted that people have rallied round to protect these jobs, and now we can all agree that Grangemouth has an outstanding future," he added. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael also welcomed the announcement, saying that it was "the news that we all wanted". "The staff and their families have been through a very stressful and uncertain time," he added. The announcement came as BP said it had reached an agreement with Ineos which would ensure that oil and gas supplies from the Forties Pipeline System would be secured. The pipeline - which brings oil and gas ashore from more than 50 North Sea fields - as well as BP's processing plant at Kinneil depend on steam and power from Grangemouth. BP said "some key commercial terms" had been adjusted in an existing deal with Ineos, but did not elaborate. It added: "By doing this, we have ensured that over a third of the North Sea's total oil and gas supplies will be unaffected, and that our motorist and airline customers will enjoy supply security." Ineos' future plans at Grangemouth include investing £300m in a new gas terminal at the site. Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean said: "It is a huge investment and that investment was only rightly to be done if we had a long-term sustainable base. "What we have now done is given the chemicals business another 15 to 20 years on the back of new raw materials, new contracts and significant investment." Mr MacLean would not dismiss the prospect of redundancies, but said they would be "very limited". The company has also said that 2,000 contractors it laid off after shutting down the complex would be re-hired to support investment in its survival plan. According to Ineos, the Scottish government has indicated it would support its application for a £9m grant to help finance its gas terminal plans, while the UK government has given "pre-qualification approval" for a £125m loan guarantee facility. Falkirk Council, which had planned to set up a task force to respond to the threatened closure, said the Ineos announcement was "the best possible outcome for all concerned". Council leader Craig Martin added: "There has been a tremendous effort behind the scenes to secure the plant's future involving UK and Scottish governments and Falkirk Council, working together to ensure the plant's survival. "This partnership approach has paid off and a more stable and positive future for the workforce has been delivered." </body>

      <body>Scottish councils have imposed a pay deal on their staff after almost a year of negotiations failed to reach an agreement. Council staff other than teachers will get a 1% rise backdated to April of this year - and a further 1% rise next April. The decision was taken at a meeting of the council umbrella body Cosla. Cosla said it could not allow the "dragging of feet" by the Unison union to continue. "This cannot continue any longer - our employees deserve their pay rise now," said Cosla's human resources spokesman, Councillor Billy Hendry. "We have been in negotiations with the Scottish Joint Council trade unions for almost a full year after making an initial offer in November 2012. "The unions remain divided and the time has come to apply the deal." Mr Hendry added: "I am particularly pleased with the ground-breaking award of a living wage of £7.50 per hour in 2013/14, which will deliver real benefits for employees at the lower end of the pay scale, and an agreement to match the recommended figure due next month from the Living Wage Foundation for 2014/15, which will see a further living wage increase for the lowest paid." The pay deal does not apply to teachers. Earlier this week the largest teachers' union, the EIS, rejected changes to their terms and conditions of employment. The pay deal was conditional on accepting these changes. Mr Hendry continued: "It is deeply frustrating for me that I am not in a position to announce a pay increase at this time for our teaching workforce. "The decision by the EIS not to agree a deal has resulted in what we believe is an unnecessary delay. "Talks will continue in November which we hope will also bring this matter to a conclusion." </body>

      <body>Four men have been jailed after a stash of weapons and ammunition - including an Uzi sub-machine gun with silencer - was found at a railway station. Serving soldier William Dempsey left bags of weapons at Carlisle station after getting off a train to Glasgow. He collected them from James Ashdown in Kent. They were destined for Barry Kelly and Craig Colquhoun in Scotland. Dempsey and Ashdown were each jailed for eight years. Kelly was given nine years and Colquhoun seven years. Dempsey and Ashdown had previously admitted conspiracy to buy or sell illegal firearms. Kelly and Darvel were found guilty by a jury of the same offences earlier this month. Liverpool Crown Court heard how Dempsey, 29, from Paisley, left two Army camouflage bags containing the Uzi sub-machine gun, silencer, a handgun and a sawn-off double-barrelled shotgun with two cleaners at the station. He asked them to look after the bags for him as he thought he was being followed. The court heard that the mortarman with the 5th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, was dressed in desert combat uniform and had been exhibiting "somewhat bizarre behaviour". He told staff there were snipers at the station. He had collected the firearms from his friend Ashdown, 32, in Canterbury, where Dempsey's barracks were. The court heard how the bags, found on 17 August last year, also contained Dempsey's identification papers and 194 rounds of ammunition which had his name embroidered on them. They were destined for Kelly, 34, from Darvel, Ayrshire, and Colquhoun, 28, from Barrhead. A search at Dempsey's barracks uncovered a handgun-shaped crossbow, several metal tipped arrows and large military batteries. The battalion duty officer confirmed to British Transport Police that no weapons were missing from the armoury. British Transport Police said Dempsey's mobile phone revealed messages between him and Ashdown regarding large cash payments for "toys" - items believed to be the firearms seized at Carlisle. Further investigation revealed links to both Colquhoun and Kelly. On 16 August last year Colquhoun was captured on CCTV at the Royal Bank of Scotland in Paisley paying £3,500 into Dempsey's account. While arresting Kelly, Ashdown and Colquhoun police found £20,000 hidden in the loft of Kelly's house. Prosecutor Nicholas Kennedy said it was not known where the Uzi and handgun were from but the shotgun had been stolen in a burglary at farm buildings in Maidstone in February 2007. Sentencing the four, Judge Robert Warnock said: "I am wholly satisfied that they [the weapons] were destined for use in serious crime and had a clear potential for causing serious injury and death. "Had these firearms reached their intended recipients, I have no doubt they would have significantly contributed to the upward spiral of gun crime in this country." The judge told Demspey he had used his uniform to hide what he was doing on the day he was arrested. "For reasons principally to do with your abuse of alcohol and drugs, you abandoned the firearms at Carlisle station," he said. "I make it clear, however, that these actions were not motivated by remorse or insight but your befuddled and confused thinking brought on by your alcohol and drug abuse and your consequential paranoia and instability." The judge told Kelly he was "clearly a relatively sophisticated criminal who is well-versed in the use and abuse of mobile phone technology". He said his "employee" Colquhoun was a peripheral player in the conspiracy. The court heard that Ashdown, of no fixed address, was an active street dealer of drugs who was motivated to make money to fund his cocaine habit. He was jailed for an additional three years for possession and intent to supply cocaine in a separate case. Mitigating for Dempsey, David Thompson said his client had joined the Army at the age of 17 and had served in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. He was described as a "reliable and competent soldier" but his life began to go downhill last July. He had alcohol and drug problems and had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after his battleground stints. At the time he entered the firearms conspiracy he had accumulated a drug debt of £5,000. Mr Thompson said he was exposed to influences in his home town of Paisley - which he had joined the Army to get away from when he was younger. He said Dempsey "in effect abandoned the consignment at the rail station and disappeared into town." "He tells me he knew he was going to be arrested and was enjoying a final pint of beer." Mr Thompson said it was "a crying shame" that the defendant had become involved in a conspiracy "diametrically opposed" to the 12 years of service he had given to his country. "He is filled with remorse for getting involved and the shame he has brought upon his regiment," the barrister said. The court heard that Kelly maintained his innocence. Following sentencing, Det Ch Insp Simon Taylor, who led British Transport Police's investigation, said: "These four clearly intended to put illegal firearms on to the streets of Scotland and it is a fair assumption that they would have been used to commit criminal acts or to intimidate people. "In uncovering and unravelling the complex conspiracy BTP, in partnership with Kent Police and Police Scotland, have taken this potential threat out of circulation and ensured the conviction of four dangerous men." </body>

      <body>Two brothers have been convicted of killing a man after a feud between rival kebab shops turned violent. Azeem and Zeeshan Aslam were found guilty of culpable homicide after the fatal attack on Anthony Dryden in March. The 42-year-old was battered to death after smashing a window at the Aslams' family takeaway shop in Airdrie. One of the pair was later heard boasting how Mr Dryden had been "fixed". Sentence was deferred. Azeem and Zeeshan Aslam - aged 26 and 23 respectively - had both stood trial at the High Court in Glasgow accused of murder. But a jury found them guilty of the reduced charge of culpable homicide. The killing brought to a head a dispute between the Ali's Kebabs shop, which was owned by the Aslams, and the owners of the nearby Nico's restaurant, where Mr Dryden's aunt worked. This included claims of a fire attack, extortion and other threats. The jury heard how Hamid Shah applied to set-up Nico's takeaway in the same street as Ali's Kebabs. The Aslam family objected to the council, but permission was eventually granted and Mr Shah began renovating his premises. However, Mr Shah and his employees became targets of intimidation even before his shop had opened. Prosecutor Murdoch MacTaggart asked Mr Shah: "Did that bother you?" He replied: "Yes, my shop was set on fire as well. I reported it to the police." It was also alleged the Aslams demanded £150 a week or Nico's would be burned down. Mr Shah told the jury one of the brothers later passed his shop and made a chilling cut-throat gesture. Asked what he thought this meant, the witness added: "It is because they are competition and they are trying to scare me." Windows at Nico's were also then smashed on two occasions. On 23 March this year - the day of the killing - Ali's Kebabs was then struck in an apparent revenge attack when Anthony Dryden broke a window. Mr Shah told the jury he was not behind it but that one of his workers - an aunt of Mr Dryden - had mentioned it as the "police were not doing anything". Mr Shah said: "She did suggest it, but I said no. She said it two or three times, but then I said it is up to you what you want to do." The jury heard how the Aslam brothers raced out of their shop and chased Mr Dryden into a back garden nearby. Azeem Aslam repeatedly hit Mr Dryden with a baseball bat while his brother struck the victim with a piece of wood that had been lying on the ground. The pair then fled leaving their battered victim to die. Azeem Aslam was later heard saying: "Fixed that guy - even broke the baseball bat." Mr Dryden, of Motherwell, suffered serious skull and brain injuries from which he did not recover. Azeem Aslam testified during the trial and admitted there had been "tension" between the two takeaways. He recalled hitting Mr Dryden "four or five times" that day, but only in self defence. He claimed the victim had a hammer. Azeem Aslam insisted: "I had to do it - I had no choice." But prosecutor Mr MacTaggart said Mr Dryden was the one defending himself as the brothers came at him in a "pincer movement" with "weapons raised". The advocate depute went on: "Mr Dryden just gave up and accepted that he was going to get a beating. That's what he got from you and Zeeshan." The accused denied that was the case. Judge Lord Stewart deferred sentencing for reports until 21 November at the High Court in Edinburgh. </body>

      <description>Scottish Labour's Cara Hilton wins the Dunfermline by-election for the Scottish Parliament, taking the seat from the SNP.</description>

      <body>Labour has won the Scottish Parliament by-election in Dunfermline, after beating the SNP by almost 3,000 votes. The victory represented a gain from the SNP, who took the seat in the 2011 Holyrood election. The by-election was caused by the resignation of sitting MSP Bill Walker, who was thrown out of the SNP and jailed for domestic abuse. Cara Hilton, the parliament's newest MSP, said the people of Dunfermline "deserved better". The SNP won Dunfermline as part of its landslide election win in 2011 with a majority of just 590 votes, but was not able to hold on. In the end, Labour took the seat with a majority of 2,873 - a 7% swing from the SNP. The Liberal Democrats came third in the contest, with the Conservatives in fourth place. Ms Hilton said: "After the disgrace of Bill Walker, Dunfermline deserves better and I will ensure that we will be better - far better than what went before." And ahead of the SNP administration's independence referendum next year, she added: "We need a Scottish government that will address the needs of Scots, not one that will simply make promises about what will happen after 2016. "Today Dunfermline has sent a message to Bute House and Alex Salmond: it's time for you to focus on the real priorities of Scots, not your constitutional obsession." The by-election campaign centred on contentious local issues, including proposed school closures, while the SNP focused on its national policies such as the council tax freeze and the decision to remove the tolls on the nearby Forth Road Bridge. Despite the result, SNP candidate Shirley-Anne Somerville said she was proud of the campaign she fought. "We've run a positive campaign trying to support local parents in their schools and I hope we can come together, all of us in the party, to make sure those three schools in the Dunfermline constituency stay open," she said. The Liberal Democrats saw their vote drop by 8% on the night. Candidate Susan Leslie said: "I think it has been a victory for women in politics in Scotland that four women stood in this by-election and fought positive campaigns on the issues for Dunfermline." Scottish Conservative candidate James Reekie - whose party saw a 1% increase in its vote - added: "When the people of Dunfermline are faced with the dilemma of Labour and the SNP, they chose the Conservatives." Turnout in the by-election was 42.65%. </body>

      <body>A major search has been launched after a passenger was reported missing from a ferry in the Northern Isles. The passenger - believed to be in his 40s - was thought to have gone overboard from the NorthLink ferry Hrossey, which was sailing from Kirkwall in Orkney to Lerwick in Shetland. The area being searched is to the east of the island of Sanday in Orkney. Three lifeboats and a coastguard helicopter were involved in the search. A fisheries protection vessel and a local fishing boat were also assisting. Ferry operator NorthLink said the captain of the Hrossey was notified of the incident at about 04:00. They said he immediately turned his vessel to begin a search for the passenger. The MV Hrossey left Kirkwall at 00:25 and had been due to arrive in Lerwick at 07:30. It had 172 passengers on board. Hrossey was later released from the search, and headed to Lerwick. </body>

      <body>A Royal Navy officer who was skippering a racing yacht that hit an oil tanker in the Solent has been found guilty of contravening maritime regulations. The Atalanta of Chester, belonging to Lt Roland Wilson, of Stanley, Perthshire, collided with the 260m-long Hanne Knutsen during Cowes Week 2011. The 32-year-old was convicted at Southampton Magistrates' Court of impeding the passage of a vessel. He was also found guilty of failing to keep a proper lookout. Mr Wilson, who was a serving Royal Navy officer at the time but is now a lieutenant in the reserves, had seen the tanker from five miles (8km) away, the court heard. It had been making its way to Fawley oil refinery. Wilson had told the court the ship had signalled to turn but never did, describing its manoeuvre as "unexpected". District Judge Anthony Callaway said he took the wrong decision in continuing towards the path of the tanker and not taking evasive action. The moment of impact was filmed and the video posted on YouTube, where it was watched more than 924,000 times. Mr Callaway said: "Fortuitous it was that there was no loss of life. The potential for even greater and tragic consequence is, in my judgement, apparent. "This was a serious yacht crewed by serious people in a regatta for a serious purpose. It was well equipped in terms of experience and ability to deal with any situation. "This was not some Saturday afternoon jaunt by some inadequate vessel crewed by inexperienced, clueless and foolhardy people who frankly have no business being on the water at all. "The yacht took a decision, and as I find the wrong decision, to sail towards the problem into the path of the tanker across a narrow channel. It should have kept clear and in the worst event used her engine." The judge said conditions in the Solent were crowded due to Cowes Week but the yacht's crew were experienced enough to perform the "difficult manoeuvre". He added: "The fact it didn't do so was the product not of a lack of skill, but the product of the wrong decision at the wrong time, for which the skipper, Roland Wilson, must take responsibility." Cowes Week sailing director Stuart Quarrie witnessed the collision from the shore. He said: "It developed very quickly and at the time, there was no idea if anyone was seriously hurt. "Thankfully, the injuries sustained were relatively minor. "I don't think there's any long-term damage to the relationship between the regatta and the port authorities from this incident because of the professional manner in which it has been dealt with." Mr Wilson was ordered to pay a fine of £3,000, and costs of more than £100,000. The yacht, which had a crew of eight, suffered a damaged mast and its sail almost became entangled in the anchor of the Hanne Knutsen. One crew member suffered minor head injuries and another abandoned ship after the collision with the 120,000-tonne tanker. Mr Wilson was convicted of one count of failing to keep a proper lookout and two counts of impeding the passage of a tanker in a restricted channel. </body>

      <title>Sharp rise in council's rent arrears</title>
      <description>North Lanarkshire Council claims more than 2,000 of its tenants are in rent arrears for the first time after housing benefit changes.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24662376</url>
      <date>1382706036</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70698000/jpg/_70698042_houses.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>More than 2,000 people in one part of Scotland have got into rent arrears for the first time since changes to housing benefit were made in the spring. North Lanarkshire Council thinks it is owed £675,000 from tenants because of the spare room subsidy - dubbed the bedroom tax, by critics. The council is the largest local authority landlord in Scotland. It also believes many people who could be eligible for help to deal with their benefit cut have not applied for it. This is the most detailed assessment so far of the impact of the changes on one council area in Scotland. More than 5,000 council tenants in North Lanarkshire lost some of their housing benefit in April because they were deemed to have spare bedrooms. An analysis produced by the council - covering the six months up to September - said 2,333 tenants who previously had no rent arrears owed the authority money by September. A further 1,100 already had rent arrears before the changes took place. This meant that 3,449 of the 5,201 people who lost some of their housing benefit in North Lanarkshire had rent arrears. Overall, rent arrears over the past six months were up by two thirds compared to the same period last year though the council was stressing the changes to housing benefit were only one reason for this. Tenants now owe the council more than £2.5m in total. The council said about £675,000 of these arrears could be the result of the benefit changes. However, the council also believes that some people who could have been helped by the special discretionary housing payments, available to those affected by the benefit changes, may not have applied for them. This means that some of the arrears may have been avoidable - or that there could have been help for people who have struggled to make up for the loss of benefit. North Lanarkshire said it would not evict tenants solely because of spare room subsidy arrears during this financial year as long as they had contacted the housing service for assistance and advice. A spokesman said: "Clearly the UK government's welfare reforms are already having a significant effect on our tenants. "The council has set aside funds to assist vulnerable people in every way possible but it is essential that tenants who are worried or in difficulty talk to us. "We have hired additional trained advisers who can discuss each case and provide help with applications for financial assistance. We have already helped thousands of people, so anyone who needs that assistance should contact their local housing office." Council leader Jim McCabe condemned the UK government's changes to housing benefit but urged people who have been affected to speak to the council to see if help could be provided. The council has nearly £1.2m available to hand out in these payments - £470,000 of it is from the UK government, the rest is from the council's own budget. So far it has paid out £350,000 in these payments to nearly 2,900 people. Separate figures from the council give some indication of the scale of the arrears that individuals are building up. As of last week, about 460 people have arrears equivalent to the cut in their benefit while 500 have built up new arrears since April of an even greater amount. The other tenants with arrears appear to have tried to make up some of the shortfall or have received help. The Scottish Conservatives' welfare spokesman Alex Johnstone MSP said the figures showed that the issue of welfare reform was not as black and white as the Scottish government, and what he called the "left-wing establishment", would like to make out. Mr Johnstone said: "Welfare reform is a challenge that must be addressed so that it is fair to those who receive, and fair on those who pay for it. "The ever-growing cost of the welfare budget is something which successive governments have failed to address. "But the 'ignore the problem and it might go away' approach simply hasn't worked and has only resulted in fostering a culture of people being left to languish on benefits for years." A spokesperson for the UK Department for Work and Pensions said: "Scotland has been given £10m this year to help vulnerable people and we are monitoring this spending carefully to ensure that tenants get the support they need during welfare reforms. "It is important to remember that housing benefit will still cover the vast majority of people's rent, but the taxpayer can no longer afford to pay for spare bedrooms. "People have a number of options available to them, including moving to another property in the public or private sector, or making up the difference in rent through going into work or working more hours." Scottish Housing Minister Margaret Burgess said: "We know that 80% of households affected by the bedroom tax contain an adult with a recognised disability, and over 15,000 children are affected. "That's why have consistently expressed our opposition to this measure. "The Scottish government is doing all it can to help the people hit by the bedroom tax, with £20m of funding available this year and a further £20m available next year." </body>

      <body>Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum is showing 14 new acquisitions in a major redisplay of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Glasgow Style works. The eight purchases and six donations add new metalwork, ceramics, glass and stained glass to the collection. They include pieces by David Gauld, Archibald Knox, Alexander Ritchie and Christopher Dresser. The redisplay also features other works from Glasgow's civic collection which have not been on show for decades. The eight purchases were made with financial support from The National Fund for Acquisitions administered through National Museums Scotland, the Art Fund and The Heritage Lottery Fund. Councillor Archie Graham, chairman of Glasgow Life, the body which runs Kelvingrove Museum, said the city had "arguably one of the finest civic collections in Europe" thanks to help from partner bodies who helped with funding. "Together we have been able to bring beautiful works by important artists, several of them born in our great city, to the millions of people who visit Kelvingrove every year," he said. "This new display provides plenty to marvel at and an opportunity to learn a little more about their influences and techniques." Glasgow Life said the new acquisitions "reveal the skills, experimentation, influences and imagination" of artists working across Britain between the 1880s and 1930s in the Glasgow Style or part of the wider Arts and Crafts movement. One of the new items on show is a stained and leaded glass panel entitled 'Music', which was designed by Glasgow Boy David Gauld. The piece was made by the Glasgow stained glass workshop of Hugh McCulloch and Company around 1891. Another new exhibit is a copper kettle by Christopher Dresser, a pioneer of the British Design Reform Movement, dating from about 1880 to 1885. This piece was made by Benham and Froud of London. </body>

      <body>The wife of a security guard charged with murdering a conference delegate at Glasgow's SECC complex has told his trial he has a violent temper. Paula Carter told the High Court in Glasgow that she had called police on a number of occasions about her husband Clive's outbursts towards her. Carter, 35, denies murdering Khanokporn Satjawat, 42, from Thailand, at the Clyde Auditorium on 12 November 2012. He has admitted killing her while suffering diminished responsibility. Mrs Satjawat died while attending a conference for HIV drug therapy at the Clyde Auditorium, which is part of the SECC complex. She sustained massive head and facial injuries after being battered with a fire extinguisher in a female toilet. Carter, from Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, was working as a security guard at the venue at the time of the incident. He has claimed he has no memory of the killing or alleged attempts to cover it up. During evidence on Friday, Mrs Carter said her husband could be violent but denied saying that he was manipulative. The witness was asked by advocate depute John Scullion, prosecuting: "Is your husband manipulative, does he manipulate you?" She replied: "No." Mr Scullion referred to a statement in which Mrs Carter allegedly said her husband was manipulative. He asked her: "Does it say: 'If Clive doesn't get his own way he's like my eight-year-old. He stamps his feet, breaks stuff. He's manipulative.' Did you say that to the police?" Mrs Carter replied: "I don't know." The prosecutor accused Mrs Carter of "choosing not to remember." She replied: "Please don't put words into my mouth," then added: "I can't remember." Asked if her husband had ever strangled her, Mrs Carter said he had done so once. He showed her a police statement taken on 13 January in which she stated: "I didn't have any marks or bruises. He just strangled me to the point of going red and then he let me go." Mr Scullion asked: "Did you say that to the police?" Mrs Carter replied: "I don't know, I don't know what the context is. I don't remember the conversation. I can't remember saying that." She did admit to the jury that Carter often had episodes of explosive rage where he would throw things at her. These items included a coffee table and a laptop. She told the jury: "He threw whatever was to hand." She also revealed that on one occasion when he could not find a tin opener he wrecked the kitchen. Mrs Carter said: "The only thing left standing was my microwave." She denied trying to protect her husband, adding: "I don't excuse what my husband has done at all." She also told the prosecutor: "You are trying to portray me as a battered wife. I'm not, I give as good as I get." She told defence QC Ian Duguid that after the violent explosive incidents Carter could not remember what he had done. The witness added: "Once when he pushed me to the ground in a rage he came back into the room and said what are you doing on the floor. He didn't realise what he had done until I told him." The QC then asked: "Is he able to control himself when he's in one of his explosive rages?" She replied: "No." Psychiatrist Dr John Crichton told the jury that he believed Carter had an emotionally unstable personality of the impulse type. The trial before judge Lord Matthews continues. </body>

      <body>Manager Anna Signeul believes a new funding agreement for the women's game is a "game-changer" for Scotland. A Scottish Government initiative will provide £200,000 to cover the qualifying period for the 2015 World Cup and allow players to work less. "This is going to have a major impact on the day-to-day lives of these players," Signeul told BBC Scotland. "They are training 15 to 20 hours a week and that is hard to sustain on top of 40 hours work." Scotland have never reached a major tournament, having missed out on the last two European Championship finals at the play-off stage. The majority of Scotland players currently fit their football commitments around full-time work or study and the new financial support will allow for more recovery time as well as more strength and conditioning sessions. "To reduce the work load and be able to rest a little bit more and maybe get some more training time, it's going to make a huge difference," Signeul told BBC Scotland. "Some of the players had already made the decision to work part-time but not everyone can afford to do that." Midfielder Kim Little is one of the few Scotland players to earn a wage from playing and she also welcomes the new injection of money. "I'm very lucky to be at Arsenal and to be able to focus mainly on my football," she said. "It's definitely helped me a lot. "For Scotland to move to the next level, this is definitely the way to go. "You can see the difference funding has made to the England team. They are a very good side now - in the top four in Europe. "In terms of fitness and technique, giving the girls more time to train will improve our national team - without a doubt." Scotland are seeded second in their World Cup qualifying group, behind Sweden, and have opened with high-scoring wins against the Faroe Islands and Bosnia. The Scots host Northern Ireland on Saturday and travel to Poland next week. Meanwhile, Signeul is on a shortlist of 10 candidates for Fifa's Women's Coach of the Year award, with the world governing body describing Scotland as "a quiet success story". </body>

      <body>An Edinburgh author has been named the winner of the Edinburgh International Book Festival's 2013 First Book Award. Angela Jackson, one of 42 writers in contention, said it felt "particularly special" to win the prize for her debut novel, The Emergence of Judy Taylor. Visitors to this year's festival voted her book ahead of other first works by such authors as Gill Hornby, sister of Nick, and broadcaster Dawn O'Porter. Jackson's novel tells of a dissatisfied wife who embarks on a new life. "It's great to know I'm on the right track [and] that my work is connecting with readers," the author continued. The former musician and psychology lecturer said the prize would "spur [her] on to complete my second novel". Nick Barley, director of the Edinburgh International Book Festival, said Jackson's triumph was "a wonderful, home-grown success story". "Angela gave her first public reading at the Book Festival in 2010 and appeared again in 2011," he continued. "We were delighted to welcome her this year as a fully fledged and published author." Edinburgh's book festival, held every August in the city's Charlotte Square Gardens, celebrated its 30th anniversary this year. </body>

      <body>A Scottish health board has uploaded a short film to video sharing website YouTube in a bid to recruit new staff. The video promoting vacancies in NHS Highland's cancer treatment services is the first in a series the board plans to produce to attract new employees. In the six-minute film, workers seek to dismiss misconceptions about the Highlands. Last month, NHS Highland was unsuccessful in a second attempt to fill seven GP vacancies. In the YouTube film, several members of staff talk about what the health board and the Highlands have to offer. They say Inverness's Raigmore Hospital, which has a vacancy for a consultant oncologist, has cutting edge technology to match larger city hospitals. Raigmore has also led the way in the use of image guided radiotherapy, staff point out during the film. The employees have also sought to dispel mistaken ideas about the region. Steve Colligan, head of radiotherapy physics, says: "I think people do believe the Highlands is a bit backwards and not up-to-date and I think it's important to reassure everyone that we have running water and electricity." Dr Carol MacGregor, a Macmillan consultant in clinical oncology, adds that the area offers a wide range of activities that do not involve "Gortex and wellies". The Scottish government has supported the use of video to help attract potential recruits to NHS Highland. Health Secretary Alex Neil said: "I am acutely conscious of the challenges we all face in providing high quality, sustainable healthcare - particularly for those who live in remote and rural communities." He added: "Initiatives such as this film produced by NHS Highland will help to promote the benefits of living and working in Highland." The closing date for applications to the consultant oncologist post is next month. NHS Highland has been facing challenges in recruiting staff to some posts. A renewed effort to fill seven GP vacancies in a remote part of the Highlands was unsuccessful, it emerged last month. NHS Highland re-advertised the posts in the sparsely populated area of West Lochaber after a first round of adverts failed to attract enough applicants. The health board had hoped a new plan for a cluster of local practices would have allayed potential applicants' concerns about having to work alone. But not enough people have come forward to staff that model of cover. The GPs are needed to cover places such as Arisaig, Acharacle and Strontian. </body>

He added: "Recovering these pills means we have ensured that they can't make their way into our communities and be used for reasons other than their prescribed purpose.

      <body>Scotland's most senior police officer has pledged to do more to improve road safety in light of a surge in offences. Chief Constable Sir Stephen House said Police Scotland wanted to change the behaviour of drivers who took risks. New figures showed a "significant" increase in the number of road safety offences in the first six months of the new single force, compared with the same period last year. Offences include 52,171 of speeding and 20,440 instances of mobile phone use. There were also 25,451 seatbelt misuse offences. Addressing an audience of road safety experts at the Road Safety Scotland annual seminar in Edinburgh, Sir Stephen said road safety was one of the priorities raised by local communities. "Evidence has shown that regular risky and illegal drivers do not acknowledge the risk they present, or view their own actions as illegal or having any real social impact," he said. "A recent study stated that almost three-quarters of all drivers admitted to risky driving behaviour in the last 12 months and more than half of those admitted to illegal behaviour in relation to speeding, mobile phones and seatbelt use. "There is a common perception among offenders that offences are committed by others, but not by themselves. "Our job is to challenge these perceptions and make people aware that offending behaviour will be dealt with." Sir Stephen said the force would continue to build a trunk roads patrol group throughout the country. "Our focus is on enforcement and by providing a more visible, dedicated resource across our national and local roads networks, we can help deter and detect poor driver behaviour," he said. "Greater enforcement has led to some good early results. However, it is worth remembering that in 2012, 174 people died on our roads - three times more than the homicide rate. "I regard this as simply unacceptable." He added: "We will continue to work with others to improve awareness of road safety and challenge offending behaviour in order to keep people safe on Scotland's roads." </body>

      <body>Two men who spent almost £7,000 with an OAP's credit card have been told to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work. Soham Emmanuel, 21, from Glasgow, pled guilty to duping Catherine Black, 86, into handing over her card and PIN. He also admitted fraudulently obtaining a Macbook, two iPads and other goods totalling £4,200 from Tesco stores. Nouman Chaudhary, 20, also from Glasgow, admitted fraud charges, and charges of theft by taking money out using the card, totalling £2,659. At Glasgow Sheriff Court, both men were told to carry out the unpaid work as part of a year-long community payback order. The court heard how Mrs Black agreed to hand her card over after being contacted at her home in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire. On 26 June last year, Emmanuel went with another other man to collect the card at Mrs Black's home. It was accepted by the Crown that he sat in a car and did not go to the door, but that he knew why he was there. After obtaining the card, Emmanuel, from Drumchapel, went on a spending spree, buying a Macbook, two iPads and other goods from various Tesco stores. The court heard that the following day, the card was passed to Chaudhary, from Pollokshields. He also bought a number of goods, including two laptops and cigarettes, and withdrew cash using Mrs Black's card. Both men were caught after Mrs Black spoke to a family member about what had happened. The registration of the car used during Chaudhary's shopping trips was traced and both accused were found in the car along with "incriminating articles". The court was told that the bank compensated Mrs Black for her loss but the unrecovered loss from both accused amounted to about £4,000. </body>

      <description>An Argyll seafood firm wins a legal ruling against a local rival over who can trade from green-painted premises.</description>

      <body>An Argyll seafood firm has won a legal ruling against a local rival over who can trade from green-painted premises. John Ogden and Marion Ritchie said their green shack on Oban Pier lost business after being confused with Gordon MacGillivray's green mobile van. A judge has now granted an interim interdict preventing Mr MacGillivray from running a nearby firm from "wholly or predominantly green" premises. Lord Pentland said it was open for Mr MacGillivray to contest the decision. The Court of Session in Edinburgh heard that the shellfish business run by Mr Ogden and Ms Ritchie had been mentioned by "a considerable number of contributors" to the Trip Advisor site as being a green shack or hut or something of that nature. An entry in the Lonely Planet guide had also described it as "the green shack on the quayside". The court heard that Mr MacGillivray had traded for some years, but from a white kiosk. Recently his business has been run from a new green-coloured catering outlet. Paul O'Brien, counsel for Mr Ogden and Ms Ritchie, told the Court of Session in Edinburgh: "Ultimately what the pursuer is seeking is for the defender to repaint. "The pursuer is suffering a loss of trade from the confusion generated by the presence of the defender's other green outlet. "It is in a position on that pier where potential customers will reach it first. Although it is not strictly a hut, it certainly is a small portable retail outlet." The judge ruled that Mr Ogden and Ms Ritchie had succeeded is showing that they had a case, at first view, based on passing off in the intellectual property action. Lord Pentland granted the partners in Girl Norma Shellfish, an interim interdict against Mr MacGillivray, of MacGillivray's Seafood. Under the terms of the order he is prevented from passing off any bar or restaurant on or within 250 metres of the railway pier in the town as being theirs. It particularly prohibits Mr MacGillivray from carrying on such a business from a kiosk, hut, shack or similar structure that is "wholly or predominantly green". The judge said a number of specific instances had been given in which confusion has arisen because of the presence of two green seafood facilities on the pier. Lord Pentland said a prima facie case was made out by the shellfish business that they have suffered and are likely to continue to suffer financial loss due to the confusion. The judge said he did not think it would be right to dismiss "any such diversion of trade" as minimal. </body>

      <body>Inverness Caledonian Thistle posted a modest gain of £22,000 on the financial year to 31 May; the club's first profit since 2007. The results are a marked improvement on last year's deficit of £379,000. Last season, the Highlanders enjoyed their highest ever placing in the top flight, finishing fourth, despite trimming the wage bill for players. And the club say they continue to operate without any long-term debt or overdraft facilities. There was no cash generated by player sales, with Owain Tudor Jones and Andrew Shinnie among those leaving the club under freedom of contract, but clinching fourth-place resulted in a healthy increase in prize money after a 10th-place finish in 2011/12. Revenue was also boosted by a run to the League Cup semi-finals. "At the start of this financial year, the board in conjunction with the management team had to make some serious cuts to the playing budget following consecutive years of losses which, though manageable, could not be sustained in the long term," said chairman Kenny Cameron. "It is testament to the shrewdness and undoubted skills in 'talent spotting' of Terry Butcher and Maurice Malpas, ably assisted by head scout Steve Marsella, that, having made the cuts in the playing budget, the team excelled under their leadership." Caley Thistle's turnover for this financial year was £3,721,192 compared to £3,443,053 the year before, while administrative expenses were down £111,000. "Our strategy and business model have served us well," added Cameron. "We have substantially reduced our cost base. We have excellent people and a robust strategy that will ensure we continue to improve as a club and a business and strive for the long-term sustainability of the company. "We have improved our balance sheet position from a £60,000 negative in 2012 to a healthy £238,000 positive position, a key health check in any business." The balance sheet money was raised by generating extra share capital. </body>

      <body>A Care Inspectorate order to close Clachnaharry House care home in Inverness could be reviewed. Earlier this month, the watchdog ordered operators RDS Healthcare to shut the home because of concerns about the quality of care provided. The company was given 14 days to ask the inspectorate to review its decision. A spokesman for the watchdog confirmed a request for a review had been received and would be considered. NHS Highland suspended its admissions to the home in November 2012. The Care Inspectorate then served the care home with an improvement notice after raising concerns about the state of flooring and bathrooms. It also highlighted issues over staffing levels and record keeping. RDS Healthcare has plans to close the home temporarily at the end of December to carry out refurbishment work. However, the Care Inspectorate wants more immediate action taken. </body>

      <body>An attempted theft at a cash machine in Ellon is being investigated by police. The incident happened at the Clydesdale Bank in the Aberdeenshire town's Market Street in the early hours of Friday. It came as police investigate five similar incidents in the north east of Scotland. Officers are probing recent thefts in Bieldside, New Deer and Duffus, and attempts on machines in Oldmeldrum and Inverurie. Det Insp Graeme Mackie said of the Ellon incident: "We are investigating damage to an ATM. "We have dedicated officers looking into this matter and we will be keeping an open mind to see whether this attempted theft is connected to previous incidents." </body>

      <body>Fines are to be introduced next month for vehicles which are parked inappropriately or for too long at Borders General Hospital. From Monday, motorists will receive a "friendly warning". However, that regime will only last four weeks before penalties begin to be imposed. NHS Borders said it remained committed to providing free parking but that the present situation was actually putting people at risk. From 25 November, £90 fines will be issued to those who leave cars in "inappropriate" places - such as outside spaces, on kerbs, on chevrons or in ambulance bays - reduced to £40 if paid within 14 days. The car parks nearest the hospital will be designated for short stays with a four-hour limit for both patients and staff between 08:00 and 17:00. Monday sees the start of a four-week transitional period before the fines are brought into force. </body>

      <body>The chairman of a council social work committee has said the authority faces a "challenge" in finding the resources to meet demand for its services. Andy Ferguson was speaking after a report showed a rise in the deficit facing the Dumfries and Galloway Council department to £205,000. Savings of some £1.1m also need to be found by March next year. Mr Ferguson said he believed the fact that services were working well could create extra budget pressures. He said finances could always be put under strain by surges in demand. "We cannot give guarantees - we do not know what is going to come through the door," he said. "There was an increase in children, for example, who have been diagnosed on the autistic spectrum. "We are identifying earlier and dealing with earlier the problems that some children have." He said better awareness, improved working between agencies and early identification had to be a "positive thing". "It does create a challenge for the politicians in how we actually get the resources to meet that need," he added. </body>

      <body>Staff at Stirling Council have called off industrial action which was set to take place from Monday. The two-week bin collection strike was suspended after the council and unions agreed to re-enter discussions over terms and conditions. A meeting between the council and the GMB, Ucatt, Unison and Unite unions will be held on Monday. A joint statement said the action had been suspended to allow for negotiations. The dispute has centred on the council's plans for a 0.5% pay cut across all pay grades and an additional hour of work per week. A revised offer which included a guarantee to restore the pay cut, and implement a national 1% pay rise, at a future date was rejected by the unions earlier this month. The unions said the changes did not address the key issues of working more hours and changes to terms and conditions. The council has said the changes are necessary as it needs to make savings of £24m due to a real terms cut in the funding it receives from the Scottish government. </body>

      <body>The 60th anniversary of one of the most tragic days for the RNLI in Arbroath is to be marked this weekend. Six crewmen died when the Robert Lindsay lifeboat was struck by a huge wave close to the harbour on 27 October 1953. Only one man survived. They had been searching for a vessel in distress. Their lives will be commemorated by the local community and the current RNLI crew who will be laying a wreath at sea on Sunday. David Bruce, Harry Swankie, William Swankie, Thomas Adams, David Cargill and Charles Cargill all died in the tragedy. The only survivor was Archibald Smith, who was able to hold on to a rope thrown across the boat by watchers on land. A plaque with the names of the crew is displayed in the Arbroath lifeboat shed in remembrance of the disaster. Alex Smith, the lifeboat operations manager at Arbroath, said: "It is the darkest day in our history here at Arbroath lifeboat station and the sacrifice of those lost has been, and continues to be, an inspiration to generations of crewmen. "Unfortunately, it also serves as a stark reminder of the risks that volunteer lifeboat crews face to help others at sea." Church services will also be held in Arbroath on Sunday to mark the event. All-weather lifeboat RNLB Inchcape will be launched at 15:00 for the wreath-laying ceremony. </body>

      <body>Nicola White has been named as the winner of the 2013 Dundee International Book Prize. Her crime thriller novel, In the Rosary Garden, beat competition from more than 350 entries. The book is inspired by a notorious true case from the 1980s of infanticide in Ireland. The Irish debut novelist has been awarded a publishing deal and a cash prize of £10,000. Her entry was chosen from a final three by a judging panel comprising of Brian Cox, Lorraine Kelly, Norman Foster, Claire Alexander and AL Kennedy. The two runner up titles were Mango, written by Jeff Hayden, and What to do with Lobsters in a Place Like Klippisfontein, by Colette Victor. The ninth winner of the competition, which has been running since 2000, was described by judge AL Kennedy as "courageous and intelligent". Previous publications Although In The Rosary Garden is Nicola's first novel, her short stories have been published widely and broadcast on radio. Last year she was Leverhulme Writer in Residence at the University of Edinburgh and was the 2008 winner of the Scottish Book Trust New Writers Award. The author grew up in Dublin and New York and now lives on the Clyde coast. She previously worked as a contemporary art curator, in Glasgow, and produced arts programmes for BBC radio and television. The decision to award the prize to Ms White was praised by crime novelist Val McDermid who called the book "mesmerising". Ms White said: "I'm just very pleased that the book gets to be ushered into the world in the best way, with editorial care and a bit of fanfare - and the money is no small thing." </body>

      <body>Debate about pension provision in an independent Scotland still lacks clarity in key areas, according to a professional body. European status and what currency would be used were among the main issues at stake, the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA) suggested. The Scottish government published a paper last month on pensions, if independence is backed. It said the basic state pension would still be paid "on time and in full". The document added that from 2016 new pensioners would be given £160 a week - making them £1.10 better off than those in the rest of the UK. The people of Scotland will vote in the Scottish independence referendum on 18 September next year. They will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country." Martin Potter, leader of the Scottish board at IFoA, said: "Scotland becoming an independent country would have a significant impact on financial services, including pensions and insurance, the regulation of the sector and its future growth. "As an independent professional body with a Royal Charter, the IFoA has a public-interest duty to uphold. "In raising questions that it believes to be pertinent, the IFoA looks to serve the public interest by informing the debate on these important issues ahead of next September's referendum. "Whether a referendum results in an independent Scotland or not, it is right that discussion about how change could affect Scotland happens now. "Across the sector, we are still limited by the lack of clarity to date on the status of an independent Scotland in relation to the EU and the many financial implications of that uncertainty, all of which need to be considered." The paper looks at challenges facing financial services and at cross-border schemes, raising concern about the future of underfunded pension plans. In April, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland said changes to pension rules with Scottish independence could force substantial costs on employers with unfunded schemes. European directives mean UK-wide schemes would be deemed "cross-border" and need to be fully funded, the body said. The reported stated: "This is as important a subject for rUK (the rest of the UK) as it is for Scotland. "Many employers based in rUK have Scottish employees. For those companies and their staff, a definitive view on this matter would be very welcome. As such, the matters highlighted within this section would apply to all post-independence cross-border schemes." </body>

      <title>Rent arrears up since benefit reform</title>
      <description>Rent arrears owed to housing associations and local authorities rose in the three months after the spare room subsidy was abolished, according to a study.</description>

      <body>Rent arrears owed to housing associations and local authorities rose in the three months after the spare room subsidy was abolished, according to a study. The Scottish Housing Regulator (SHR), has published research on the early impact of the measure, which has been dubbed the bedroom tax by critics. It said arrears increased by £789,000 in the period to the end of June 2013. It comes against a background of rising arrears in the past two years. SHR said the report, based on feedback from almost 85% of social landlords, gave the fullest available picture of the early effects of welfare reform on Scottish landlords' rent arrears. Iain Muirhead, the regulator's director of strategy and communications, said: "We want to get more information and see a fuller picture before we would draw any firm conclusions on what is happening and why. "Our research establishes a baseline and we will repeat it each quarter and report the findings." But the Early Impacts of Welfare Reform report revealed that the level of arrears had reduced during the period between March and June in each of the previous two years. In 2011 it fell by £3.5m and by £2.8m in 2012. The report said the total amount owed in rent at 30 June 2013 was £63,125,355, although this included amounts carried over from previous years. It said most landlords were facing the same problems in dealing with the effects of welfare reform. They identified increased workload and income reduction as their two biggest challenges. Support, advice and information to tenants featured prominently in the actions landlords were taking to address the early impact. David Ogilvie, policy manager for the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, said the report provided concrete evidence of a worrying trend. "This heralds tough times ahead for Scottish social landlords - be they housing associations, co-operatives or local authorities - as they face the twin challenges of increasing service delivery costs and reducing income. "Both of these challenges arise directly from welfare reform." The benefit changes form part of a revamped system. Under the new housing rules, 14% will be deducted from housing benefit for one "spare" bedroom and a quarter for two or more. The government says the changes should ensure that people are in suitably sized accommodation and release larger accommodation for people who need it. </body>

      <title>UK growth fastest for three years</title>
      <description>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show, the fastest growth since 2010.</description>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70705000/jpg/_70705133__52287135_000006818-1-1.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show. The Office for National Statistics said there had been a "fairly strong" performance across all sectors. The data builds on a 0.7% GDP rise in the April-June period and is the best quarterly performance since 2010. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne tweeted: "This shows that Britain's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity." Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the figures "show that we are firmly on the road to economic recovery". The ONS data for construction was up 2.5% over the quarter, the second successive quarter of growth after a volatile performance over the past year. The BBC's chief economics correspondent, Hugh Pym, said: "This could signal that a recovery in that sector is really under way." House-builders have been buoyed by the Government's Help to Buy scheme, which recently launched a new phase offering mortgage guarantees. The ONS said that production grew by 0.5%, though this remains 12.8% off its 2008 level, while within this, manufacturing improved 0.9% in the third quarter. The services sector, which represents three-quarters of economic output, grew by 0.7%. Output from services is now 0.4% above its pre-crisis peak in the first quarter of 2008. Friday's figure is the first estimate, and could be revised up or down in subsequent months. Mr Osborne told the BBC: "It shows that we are on the path to prosperity. Lots of risks remain, so we have to stick with the economic plan that has got us this far. "What's encouraging about these figures is that it's not just services that are growing. Construction is growing and manufacturing is growing." Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: "After three damaging years of flatlining, it's both welcome and long overdue that our economy is growing again. "But for millions of people across the country still seeing prices rising faster than their wages, this is no recovery at all." Despite the further evidence that recovery is gaining hold, some economists remain cautious. The Institute of Directors' chief economist Graeme Leach said: "The outlook looks better than at any time since the onset of the financial crisis. Indeed, our members have more confidence in the economy than at any time since 2008. "However, strong headwinds remain and the annual growth rate year on year is nothing to get too excited about yet. Though inflationary pressures are likely to remain benign, debt and inflation are rising faster than earnings. "By far the biggest challenges remain on the supply side, not the demand side. Supply side constraints mean that the current growth spurt is unlikely to extend beyond next year. "This stage of our economic recovery is likely to be short and sweet, instead of long and strong." The director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, John Longworth, said: "This is the highest quarterly increase we've seen in three years, so the economy is clearly moving in the right direction. "But we are still behind a number of advanced economies, such as the US and Germany, that have managed to recover the output lost during the economic downturn. "Much more needs to be done to transform our economy from being good to being really great." Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said the figures confirmed the UK was enjoying "a period of healthy and well-balanced growth". He said it was likely that the UK recorded the fastest quarterly growth rate within the G7 countries in the third quarter. But he added that a squeeze on real incomes as wage growth lagged behind inflation, together with the fiscal squeeze and a stagnant eurozone, were likely to prevent recovery gathering much more pace. It echoed remarks by Bank of England governor Mark Carney on Thursday evening, when he said in a speech that the rate of growth was "towards the top end of the advanced economies", but "coming from a very very low base". </body>

      <title>East Coast rail sale gets under way</title>
      <description>Re-privatising the East Coast Main line will "revitalise" it, ministers say as they kick-start the franchising process, but Labour and unions attack the move.</description>

      <body>Returning the East Coast Main line to the private sector will "revitalise" it, ministers have said as they kick-started the franchising process. The line has been publicly run since 2009 when National Express handed back the franchise amid financial problems. Ministers say the line has since been "stabilised" but they now want to "rekindle the spirit of competition". Labour and the unions say the move is "ideological" and the line should remain in public ownership. They say the failure of two successive operators to make the line - which runs from London to Edinburgh, with connected services to Inverness and Aberdeen - commercially viable and its improved performance in recent years show it can succeed under public ownership. The government began the franchising process on Friday by releasing information about the line's financial position as well as the basic criteria for interested parties and details of the commercial risks involved. The successful bidder is due to be announced in a year's time. The franchise is due to start in February 2015 and is expected to run for a maximum of 11 years. Among those reported to be interested in bidding is Eurostar, which runs services from London to the Continent. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said public ownership was never meant to be a permanent arrangement and returning the operation of the line to the private sector would bring more investment and innovation. "We want to see a revitalised East Coast railway, one that both rekindles the spirit of competition for customers on this great route and competes with the West Coast on speed, quality and customer service," he said. Since 2009, the line has been run by Directly Operated Railways, an arms-length company overseen by the Department for Transport. Figures in Friday's document suggest total journeys on the line have increased by a million to 19.1 million under public ownership while revenue has risen by 11% to £692m. In the year to October 2013, 89% of East Coast trains arrived at their final destination within 10 minutes of their advertised time, compared to a national average of 92%. Rail minister Stephen Hammond told the BBC the firm had done a "good job" but the East Coast "lagged behind" other long-distance operators in terms of punctuality while customer satisfaction was only "in line" with other routes. "There is a lot more that can be done," he said, adding that the doubling of rail passengers since privatisation in the 1990s showed the benefits of the franchise process. Critics of privatisation say the East Coast line has returned nearly £800m to the taxpayer under public ownership. But Mr Hammond said this was not a fair comparison as Network Rail had reduced charges for using the track substantially since National Express relinquished the franchise. The government says it is already planning "significant" investment in the line over the next six years, including new rolling stock, upgrades to the track around Peterborough and the rebuilding of Doncaster station. But it wants a private sector operator to "transform the customer experience", develop "innovative timetables" and identify further opportunities for improving stations along the 393-mile London to Edinburgh route. But Labour said the privatisation process - which was expected to be delayed until after the next election - was being driven by ideological reasons rather than the interests of passengers. The opposition say the government has "learnt nothing" from the debacle over the West Coast Main Line franchising process last year, which had to be abandoned after mistakes by civil servants led to flawed calculations. "We think it should be allowed to get on and act as a public sector comparator for the other rail franchises," shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh told the BBC News Channel. Asked why Labour had changed its policy since 2009, when it said public ownership was temporary, she argued the facts had changed. "We have been very surprised and happy with the directly operated railway...We think, at the very least, it should be able to bid for this franchise." The RMT union has pledged to fight the re-privatisation, saying the government is playing down the success of the line under public ownership in order to "bulldoze" the sale through. Earlier this month it claimed a leaked version of the draft sale brochure redacted sections highlighting the good punctuality and performance of the service under public ownership. "It is simply outrageous that the government are firing the starting gun on the re-privatisation of the East Coast when every objective analysis shows that this is a successful and reliable service," RMT boss Bob Crow said. And the TUC said the line needed an operator which would put passengers not shareholders first. "The government doesn't have one good argument for re-privatising the line and is yet again being blinded by outdated market dogma," said general secretary Frances O'Grady. But the Rail Delivery Group, which speaks on behalf of commercial train operators and Network Rail, said the rail network had been transformed under such a public-private business model. "This partnership is a winning formula that is delivering for passengers, businesses and the taxpayer," said the group's director general Michael Roberts. Consumer watchdog Passenger Focus said it would be scrutinising the tendering process very carefully. "It has never been more important that companies are publicly held to account for their passenger satisfaction ratings - these must be built into the very heart of the contract," said its chief executive Anthony Smith. "However, it is good to see the franchise process moving ahead again and unlocking much-needed investment." </body>

      <body>Scottish Power has announced a price rise of 8.6% for dual-fuel energy bills from 6 December. The company said it would increase gas prices by 8.5% and electricity prices by 9%. The move comes amid political wrangling over the issue of energy bills, with the government planning to review the green levies that form part of a bill. On Monday, Scottish Power was hit by an £8.5m penalty for misleading doorstep and telephone sales. The price rise would lead to a £113 increase in the average annual dual-fuel bill to £1,424, Scottish Power said. It will affect about 2.2 million Scottish Power customers. However, different areas of the country will face different price increases. For example, the rise will be 10.2% on average in southern England, but 7.3% in some areas of Scotland. Scottish Power is the fourth of the six major energy suppliers to announce price rises. SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills from 15 November, British Gas said prices for its customers would go up by 9.2% on 23 November, and Npower announced the biggest rise of 10.4% which will take effect from 1 December. Scottish Power echoed the views of other suppliers by suggesting that the price rises were the result of the rising wholesale cost of energy. The cost of delivering energy to people's homes, and the rising cost of the government's environmental and social schemes were also to blame, it said. Neil Clitheroe, chief executive of energy retail and generation for Scottish Power, said that there were a number of costs - such as windfarm payments - that did not exist 10 years ago, but which affected bills. "With an increase in costs for delivering compulsory schemes to reduce carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency in homes, we unfortunately have no other option than to pass these on by increasing our prices for customers," he said. "We understand that these are difficult times for many families, and we have done what we can to hold our prices for as long as possible. Recently we announced a range of measures to help our most vulnerable customers this winter. "We will now write to every customer who will be impacted by the price increase, and we would encourage anyone who is concerned to contact us so we can discuss their options." Ann Robinson, of price comparison website Uswitch.com, which would benefit from people switching supplier, said: "Unfortunately, the floodgates have opened and it looks like consumers are going to be buffeted by suppliers in very quick succession." Iberdrola, the Spanish parent group of Scottish Power, said that its UK operations had been affected by tight margins, as well as by energy efficiency and environmental measures imposed by the regulator. "As a consequence, generation and supply is now loss-making, and leaves the company no option but to increase tariffs," it said. There has been considerable political debate over the price rises. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election and has been on the attack over the issue. Subsequently, Prime Minister David Cameron said that there would be a review of the green levies charged to companies that are included in bills. He said this accounted for £113 on an average bill - the same amount as Scottish Power's subsequent price rise announcement. The review will be followed by a competition test for the energy market to establish how it is functioning. The Liberal Democrats called the idea a "panicky U-turn" by Mr Cameron, although Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg later said some of the environmental policies could be delivered in a more cost-effective way. On Tuesday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. On Tuesday, energy firm bosses will give evidence to a committee of MPs about the price rises. Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies introduced price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. Earlier this week, the regulator, Ofgem, said that Scottish Power customers were misled during sales approaches due to the firm's failure to "adequately train and monitor" staff. The company apologised for the errors between 2009 and 2012, and has set up a £1m compensation fund for customers who believe they were victims of mis-selling. It said it would also pay £7.5m to the 140,000 customers it has on the government-led "warm home discount scheme" aimed at supporting customers who are likely to be at risk of fuel poverty, as part of the penalty. </body>

      <body>Floodlight failure at half-time meant the first Highland derby of the season had to be abandoned. With the match poised at 0-0 after a lacklustre opening 45 minutes, Ross County's Global Energy Stadium was plunged into darkness. Inverness had the better of the first-half but referee John Beaton was busiest, issuing five yellow cards. Half-time was extended and although the floodlights briefly came on again, they failed a second time. Ross County chairman Roy MacGregor told BBC Radio Scotland: "We're really disappointed for all the fans, the officials and the players. "And also for you guys, the BBC who've come up to the Highlands for the game. "With the rain today, something outwith the ground, with the water...

      <body>Former director Dave King aims to help build consensus on the best way forward for Rangers. The South Africa-based businessman is in Glasgow for talks with both factions in the power struggle for boardroom control at Ibrox. "I'm here to see whether I am in a position to facilitate taking the club forward," said King. "To get rid of the disunity and lack of harmony both at board level and between the board and the fans." King, who invested £20m when Sir David Murray owned Rangers, has said he wants to lead the club's return to the top tier of Scottish football. On this visit, he met Sandy Easdale, one of three members of Rangers' football board. Sandy Easdale said: "I had a very pleasant meeting with Dave King at McGill's Buses in Inchinnan. "He's a very interesting man and I enjoyed his company. However our discussion was private and I will be saying nothing further." King will also hold talks with the Paul Murray-led group of shareholders, who are seeking to gain influence on the running of the League One club. "I am here for a series of meetings that are at my request," added King on his arrival at Glasgow Airport. "These meetings will remain confidential." King also spoke of his intention to explore the possibility of "assisting in a fund-raising exercise". He said: "We need a funding campaign to make sure that when the club does need money, that it is already in place with the right people at the right cost." </body>

      <body>Ricky Burns is "99%" certain to make a February return against the man who broke his jaw, according to the WBO world lightweight champion's manager. Alex Morrison says a deal is all but done for Mexico's Raymundo Beltran to return to Glasgow for a rematch. Their first meeting ended in a controversial draw last month, with the Beltran camp saying the decision "robbed" their man of the title. It emerged afterwards that Burns had broken his jaw during the fight. The injury was described at the time as "career threatening" by promoter Eddie Hearn. The Coatbridge fighter subsequently had steel plates inserted into his face to repair the damage. Burns returned to light training earlier this month and now Morrison says his fighter is keen to do the right thing. "Ricky feels it's the moral thing to do in giving Beltran another shot," Morrison told BBC Scotland. "He wants to put the record straight after fighting for 10 rounds with a broken jaw in that first fight. "We want it. Beltran wants it and the fans want it. The deal is done. We're 99% there with it and are just waiting for the final confirmation which will happen any day now. "We're looking at early February in Glasgow." </body>

      <body>There were a few cheers, a few hoots on the horns of cars and tankers, but this victory was bittersweet. The 1,370 Ineos staff had been forced to swallow the changes to pay, pensions and conditions which they had fought so hard to resist. The reason for their change of heart was clear. Grangemouth was in danger of becoming another Ravenscraig. Not for two decades had Scotland faced such a serious threat to its industrial base. Why? Because this complex matters. It supplies 70% of the fuel to Scotland's filling stations and much to Northern Ireland and the North of England too. It provides power to a vital North Sea pipeline. And, according to the Scottish government, it contributes around £1bn per year to the economy, the equivalent of some 6,500 full time jobs. Ineos had repeatedly warned that the refinery would not be able to carry on without the petrochemicals plant. And so, when the workers faced the cameras with smiles, it was in the knowledge that, just the previous day, half the complex was closing and the other half was in peril. "We were staring into the abyss," said 53-year-old Grangemouth worker John Convery, who added: "I feel very, very pleased. For myself personally, my family and my colleagues. But there's a lot of people who were very, very worried." That view was shared by one of the younger workers here, Ilolo Adigwe. "Hearing that the plant was going to shut was really worrying for everybody," she said. "So now we've got good news, everyone is happy to go back to work." Eddie Heaney, 59, gave a broad grin as he described the decision as "absolutely fantastic". "It's a chance for a new beginning, because if the management and the union can develop trust then this plant's got a great future," he said. In Grangemouth town centre the mellow voice and gentle guitar of Stuart Miller echoed around the shopping arcade. "Let it shine on" the busker sang, and it seemed to suit the mood. Almost every business for miles around depends on the plant. They had looked over the cliff and were grateful to have been pulled back. "I'm delighted at the news today," said Mr Miller, who admitted he had been "gutted" the day before. "I don't think the unions have covered themselves in any glory here," he added. That is a view shared by plenty of people around the plant, particularly among the 2,000 contractors who have lost work as a result of the dispute. Gerry Finn, who runs a bakery in the town, said: "We do rely on Ineos workers and the contractors to come in. It's a big deal for me." He said he was delighted with the settlement. But some contractors may not get back into the complex as quickly as they would hope. The founder of Ineos, Jim Ratcliffe - who made a flying visit to his plant on Friday evening - has warned that it could take until Christmas to fully fire it up again. But it could have been so much worse. Grangemouth was in danger of becoming a byword for the biggest blow to British industry in decades. Instead the town survives and hopes now to thrive again. Just before lunchtime, the workers poured out of the plant, relief etched on their faces. </body>

      <title>Taking a trip on 'most haunted' road</title>
      <description>Taking a trip on the road with most reports of supernatural activity</description>

      <body>It is reputedly the most haunted highway in Scotland. The A75 in Dumfriesshire is said to have had more reports of supernatural activity than any other road in the country. Now a Dumfries-based group of paranormal investigators has collated the stories for a ghostly Halloween road trip on Saturday night. The Kinmount straight on the road is the most notorious spot for sightings. John Hill, of Mostly Ghostly paranormal investigators, said: "So much has happened at this spot. "A quick search of the internet would bring up the A75 as the most haunted road in Scotland and some say Britain. "There are so many different things have happened on this road and been seen by so many different people as well." Mr Hill and Mostly Ghostly founder Kathleen Cronie have researched the road's supernatural history to compile the first ever ghost coach tour of the road. They have some spine-chilling accounts to relate. "There have been screaming hags, eyeless phantoms and a menagerie of unearthly creatures witnessed on this famous road," said Ms Cronie. She said one of the most infamous sightings was made by Derek and Norman Ferguson, in 1962. "They were driving along here and the whole incident began with a large hen flying towards the windscreen of their car," she said. "They then witnessed great cats and various other creatures as well as witnessing a phantom furniture van - which is a bit unusual to say the least." Bob Sturgeon lives beside the A75 and used to run a roadside snack van - at Carrutherstown, near to the sighting "hotspot". "There was very rarely a week went past without somebody telling me about some experience and usually along that Kinmount straight," he said. His business was a frequent early morning refuge for traumatised lorry drivers who had parked overnight in nearby lay-bys. "They weren't the kind of people who would talk to each other," he explained. "They were long-distance drivers - they were well separated - so it wasn't as if there was a group of them gathered in a pub and passed round stories. "Most of these things were all just individual experiences." A common sighting was groups of dejected bedraggled people pulling handcarts or carrying bundles like some medieval camp followers. One man was so shocked, he gave up lorry driving altogether and Mr Sturgeon never saw him again. "He had been parked on the Kinmount straight and he had woken up at the back of three in the morning and he saw this 'parade' of people," he said. "He said that it went on for ages and he had just frozen - he was in an awful state. "It doesn't matter if you blame it on imagination or fact or whatever, it certainly affected him badly." Documented reports of ghosts on this road go back at least 50 years. As well as seeing assorted animals, horsemen and carriages, some drivers have been convinced they have run over people - phantom figures of men, women, couples emerging from the dark. Saturday night's ghost tour is for Halloween but it is likely to be repeated several times a year, for those with the stomach to listen to the stories and the nerve to face the possibility of a spooky experience of their own. </body>

      <title>Electric dreams: Life off the Grid</title>
      <description>Family lives life off the Grid</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-24624883</url>

      <body>In the shadow of a power line undergoing a £600m revamp is a family of six with no connection to the National Grid. A BBC documentary recorded a year in their lives. For 19 years the Pococks have lived off the electricity grid, on a croft at Cougie in Glen Affric in the Highlands. They are fiercely proud of where they live and about being self sufficient. The family grows its own food - they have two dairy cows, pigs, sheep, geese, ducks and hens. Mum Sasha, 36, runs a pony trekking business while her 42-year-old husband, Iain, supplements the household income by gathering and selling scrap metal. The couple's four children - Sarah, Ryan, Ewan and Douglas - help with the running of the croft and pitch in looking after the livestock and the trekking business's 19 horses. The effort to heat and light the crofthouse, however, dominates family life. The croft is not connected to the National Grid and the family gets its electricity from a generator and a small wind turbine. But when diesel levels are low and the wind does not blow, the TV and domestic appliances are out of action and the children have to do their homework by candlelight and head torches. With a lack of power comes great responsibility. Iain carries out regular maintenance to the diesel generator and wind turbine, while the children spend a cold and wet Saturday gathering firewood. Tonnes of timber are needed to keep the house warm in winter. Iain's mother, Val, also lives on the croft. She and her family moved from Cardiff to Cougie in 1962 seeking an alternative to city life. Sixty percent of her pension goes on paying for fuel. The Pococks say they cannot get grants to install a larger turbine or solar panels because the funding requires surplus power to be exported to the Grid. Ironically, the croft is close to a massive multi-million pound electricity project. Energy giant SSE is upgrading the 137-mile (220km) Beauly to Denny transmission circuit. The 400,000-volt line will triple the capacity of the existing system, and eventually transmit vast amounts of energy from planned renewable power schemes in the Highlands to central Scotland. Six hundred new towers are being built - a reduction of 200 on the existing number. However, some towers are taller and reach heights of 65m (213ft). Opponents to the upgrade have complained that the new towers will spoil mountain landscapes. The project is expected to be completed in 2014 at an estimated cost of £600m. Sasha says the upgraded line is a blot on the landscape and, in return for having to live with it, her family should get some help getting mains electricity. "We live here in a croft at the end of the glen in the middle of nowhere, and we love it," she says. "We chose to live here. It's a great place to raise a family." But while she and her family thrive in the glen's wild, wide open spaces, Sasha is desperate for a reliable source of power. Seeing work being done to the Beauly-Denny line only fuels her quest for it. Tending to a ewe and her young lambs on a hillside overlooking the croft, Sasha's eldest child Sarah admits some people frown at her family's lifestyle. She said: "One of my friends goes to me: 'Oi, you don't look like a hillbilly, but you live like one'. And I go 'yeah, I suppose you could say that, but we're not quite though'." For Sarah there is a big distraction from the family's electric dreams. She has left school for university and swapped Glen Affric's quiet dark nights for the bright lights of Edinburgh. Power to the Pococks; A year in the life of a crofting family is a Timeline Films production. It will be shown on Thursday on BBC Two Scotland from 21:00. </body>

      <body>The Scottish Sun says axed Grangemouth staff have been thrown a 24-hour lifeline after bosses agreed to review a decision to shut the plant. According to the Daily Record, the future of Scotland's biggest industrial site lies in the hands of just one man, Ineos founder Jim Ratcliffe. Billionaire Ratcliffe, says the Herald, has not commented on Unite's u-turn over the ultimatum that its 800 workers must accept a wage freeze and the end of their final salary pension scheme. The Scotsman reports that the Ineos chairman is expected to decide today whether to revive a rescue deal for the plant. In the Press and Journal, the last survivor to escape from the wreckage of a helicopter which plunged into the North Sea reveals he still has nightmares about the disaster. </body>

      <title>UK growth fastest for three years</title>
      <description>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show, the fastest growth since 2010.</description>

      <body>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show. The Office for National Statistics said there had been a "fairly strong" performance across all sectors. The data builds on a 0.7% GDP rise in the April-June period and is the best quarterly performance since 2010. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne tweeted: "This shows that Britain's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity." Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the figures "show that we are firmly on the road to economic recovery". The ONS data for construction was up 2.5% over the quarter, the second successive quarter of growth after a volatile performance over the past year. The BBC's chief economics correspondent, Hugh Pym, said: "This could signal that a recovery in that sector is really under way." House-builders have been buoyed by the Government's Help to Buy scheme, which recently launched a new phase offering mortgage guarantees. The ONS said that production grew by 0.5%, though this remains 12.8% off its 2008 level, while within this, manufacturing improved 0.9% in the third quarter. The services sector, which represents three-quarters of economic output, grew by 0.7%. Output from services is now 0.4% above its pre-crisis peak in the first quarter of 2008. Friday's figure is the first estimate, and could be revised up or down in subsequent months. Mr Osborne told the BBC: "It shows that we are on the path to prosperity. Lots of risks remain, so we have to stick with the economic plan that has got us this far. "What's encouraging about these figures is that it's not just services that are growing. Construction is growing and manufacturing is growing." Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: "After three damaging years of flatlining, it's both welcome and long overdue that our economy is growing again. "But for millions of people across the country still seeing prices rising faster than their wages, this is no recovery at all." Despite the further evidence that recovery is gaining hold, some economists remain cautious. The Institute of Directors' chief economist Graeme Leach said: "The outlook looks better than at any time since the onset of the financial crisis. Indeed, our members have more confidence in the economy than at any time since 2008. "However, strong headwinds remain and the annual growth rate year on year is nothing to get too excited about yet. Though inflationary pressures are likely to remain benign, debt and inflation are rising faster than earnings. "By far the biggest challenges remain on the supply side, not the demand side. Supply side constraints mean that the current growth spurt is unlikely to extend beyond next year. "This stage of our economic recovery is likely to be short and sweet, instead of long and strong." The director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, John Longworth, said: "This is the highest quarterly increase we've seen in three years, so the economy is clearly moving in the right direction. "But we are still behind a number of advanced economies, such as the US and Germany, that have managed to recover the output lost during the economic downturn. "Much more needs to be done to transform our economy from being good to being really great." Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said the figures confirmed the UK was enjoying "a period of healthy and well-balanced growth". He said it was likely that the UK recorded the fastest quarterly growth rate within the G7 countries in the third quarter. But he added that a squeeze on real incomes as wage growth lagged behind inflation, together with the fiscal squeeze and a stagnant eurozone, were likely to prevent recovery gathering much more pace. It echoed remarks by Bank of England governor Mark Carney on Thursday evening, when he said in a speech that the rate of growth was "towards the top end of the advanced economies", but "coming from a very very low base". </body>

      <title>Grangemouth plant to stay open</title>
      <description>The Grangemouth petrochemical plant near Falkirk is to stay open after a new deal was struck with workers.</description>

      <body>Political leaders and unions have welcomed news that the Grangemouth petrochemical plant is to stay open after a deal was struck with workers. Operator Ineos had announced on Wednesday that the plant was to shut, with the loss of 800 jobs, after union members rejected a survival plan. But the decision was reversed after the union agreed to Ineos's conditions. Ineos founder and chairman Jim Ratcliffe said it was "a victory for common sense". He confirmed Ineos would now press ahead with plans to invest £300m in a new gas terminal at the site, following a "significant change in attitude" from the Unite union. He added: "We have had assurances from the union yesterday that the changes we have requested in order for us to invest in that facility have been agreed and we are delighted to announce that Grangemouth will restart today, both the refining and petrochemicals side." The announcement on Grangemouth's future was greeted by huge cheers from the workforce, who had gathered at the plant to be told the news. The move brings to an end a bitter dispute with the Unite union which began over the alleged mistreatment of a Unite official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but Ineos shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a survival plan, which was initially rejected by union members. Reacting to the announcement, Unite Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said: "Relief will ring right round the Grangemouth community, and across Scotland today. "Hundreds of jobs that would have been lost can now be saved and £300m will be invested into the plant." The main points of the Ineos announcement included: First Minister Alex Salmond described the development as a "tremendous fillip for the workforce and the whole Grangemouth community, following what could have been a potential disaster". He said it had been "a great team effort from all concerned", including the unions and workforce, the management and governments. "I am delighted that people have rallied round to protect these jobs, and now we can all agree that Grangemouth has an outstanding future," he added. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael also welcomed the announcement, saying that it was "the news that we all wanted". "The staff and their families have been through a very stressful and uncertain time," he added. The announcement came as BP said it had reached an agreement with Ineos which would ensure that oil and gas supplies from the Forties Pipeline System would be secured. The pipeline - which brings oil and gas ashore from more than 50 North Sea fields - as well as BP's processing plant at Kinneil depend on steam and power from Grangemouth. BP said "some key commercial terms" had been adjusted in an existing deal with Ineos, but did not elaborate. It added: "By doing this, we have ensured that over a third of the North Sea's total oil and gas supplies will be unaffected, and that our motorist and airline customers will enjoy supply security." Ineos' future plans at Grangemouth include investing £300m in a new gas terminal at the site. Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean said: "It is a huge investment and that investment was only rightly to be done if we had a long-term sustainable base. "What we have now done is given the chemicals business another 15 to 20 years on the back of new raw materials, new contracts and significant investment." Mr MacLean would not dismiss the prospect of redundancies, but said they would be "very limited". The company has also said that 2,000 contractors it laid off after shutting down the complex would be re-hired to support investment in its survival plan. According to Ineos, the Scottish government has indicated it would support its application for a £9m grant to help finance its gas terminal plans, while the UK government has given "pre-qualification approval" for a £125m loan guarantee facility. Falkirk Council, which had planned to set up a task force to respond to the threatened closure, said the Ineos announcement was "the best possible outcome for all concerned". Council leader Craig Martin added: "There has been a tremendous effort behind the scenes to secure the plant's future involving UK and Scottish governments and Falkirk Council, working together to ensure the plant's survival. "This partnership approach has paid off and a more stable and positive future for the workforce has been delivered." </body>

      <title>Jack Straw to quit at next election</title>
      <description>Jack Straw is to stand down as Labour MP for Blackburn at the next general election, he announces.</description>

      <body>Jack Straw is to stand down as MP for Blackburn at the next general election. The former Labour home and foreign secretary 67, was elected in Blackburn in 1979 and has stood in eight general elections in the constituency. He said his "love affair" with the town was "not going to end on 7 May 2015, nor is my connection with it." Labour leader Ed Miliband paid tribute to Mr Straw's "eloquence and wisdom" and said he "will continue to serve our country in many different ways". Mr Straw said: "Whatever national position I have held, the citizens of this town, and their children, have always been my first priority. "I am deeply grateful to everyone in the town for the faith which has been placed in me." But he said he had made the decision to stand down after a great deal of thought and consultation with friends and family. He added he "couldn't go on forever" and it would be "a terrible wrench" to stand down. Mr Straw held the positions of home secretary, foreign secretary and leader of the House of Commons under Tony Blair. Gordon Brown made him justice secretary in June 2007, a position he held until Labour's defeat at the 2010 election. Mr Miliband said: "Jack Straw will be greatly missed from the House of Commons. "On behalf of the Labour Party, I want to thank him for his nearly 35 years service as an MP, his achievements in government and his eloquence and wisdom. "He is Labour through and through, and always displayed this in his words and deeds. "He will be sorely missed but I know he will continue to serve our country in many different ways." Mr Straw practised as a criminal barrister before entering the Commons and was an adviser to Labour minister Barbara Castle, his predecessor as Blackburn MP. </body>

      <title>Duncan Smith hits back in Major spat</title>
      <description>A spat between two former Conservative leaders continues after Iain Duncan Smith mocks Sir John Major's support for a "cones hotline" in the 1990s.</description>

      <body>A spat between two former Conservative leaders continues after Iain Duncan Smith mocked Sir John Major's support for a "cones hotline" in the 1990s. Relations between the two men have been cool ever since Mr Duncan Smith led opposition to Sir John over the Maastricht Treaty on EU integration. On Tuesday, Sir John took a swipe at Mr Duncan Smith's welfare reforms, saying his "genius was unproven". Now Mr Duncan Smith has hit back in an interview in the Evening Standard. Asked about Sir John's comments, Mr Duncan Smith told the newspaper. "Well, as I say, I never really get too fussed about what people think about their own intellects. "I'm always happy to be in awe of someone whose own intellect delivered us the cones hotline, I must say." The cones hotline - a telephone number for motorists to ring if they were irritated by unattended road works - was one of the most mocked policies of the Major government. A source close to Mr Duncan Smith insisted to the BBC it was a throw away line and meant as a joke. There has been little love lost between the two men since, as a backbencher in the early 1990s, Mr Duncan Smith was one of a group of rebels who fought a long parliamentary campaign against the Major government's decision to sign up to the Maastricht Treaty - regarded as a landmark moment in European integration. The battles, which resulted in the Major government facing a confidence vote in the House of Commons, undermined Sir John's authority and led to the prime minister calling his opponents "bastards". He repeated the phrase in a speech to an audience of political journalists on Tuesday, saying his use of the word was "unacceptable" but "his only excuse was that it was true". In the speech, Sir John also questioned the likely outcome of Mr Duncan Smith's sweeping programme of welfare changes. "Iain Duncan Smith is trying to reform benefits," he said. "I truly wish him well. But it is enormously complicated and unless he is very lucky, which he may not be, or a genius, which the last time I looked was unproven, he may get some of it wrong." Mr Duncan Smith's Universal Credit is seen as one of the most ambitious, and potentially risky, policies the coalition has embarked upon. Chancellor George Osborne has denied reports in a recent book by the journalist Matthew D'Ancona that he had questioned whether Mr Duncan Smith had the intelligence to run a major department like work and pensions. Referring to the matter recently at the Tory conference, Mr Duncan Smith pointed out that both Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher had had their intellect questioned but had proved their doubters wrong. And Mr Duncan Smith told the Evening Standard on Friday: "I never make any claims for myself, I just say I think we should all look at each other and be a little more pleasant." </body>

      <title>Cost of ministers' advisers up £1m</title>
      <description>The cost of political special advisers has risen by £1m in the last year, official figures reveal.</description>

      <body>The salary bill for ministers' special advisers has risen by £1m in the last year, according to official figures. So-called "Spads" are appointed by ministers to provide political advice over and above the impartial work carried out by civil servants. The Cabinet Office put the increase down to the "unusual" pressures caused by coalition government. But Labour said David Cameron's pre-election promise to limit the number of special advisers was in "tatters". A leap from 85 to 98 in the number of special advisers - who work directly to ministers and often speak for them - contributed to a 16% rise in the total wage bill in 2012-13. According to the Cabinet Office, the total salary bill was £7.2m last year, up from £6.2m in 2011-12 and more than the previous government spent in its final year. Special advisers played "an important role... advising ministers and contributing to the smooth running of government", a spokesman said. "This is particularly important in a coalition and the number of special advisers reflects the unusual circumstances of this government - the first coalition government for more than 60 years." He added that special advisers represented 2.2% of the senior civil service. But Labour MP Phil Wilson accused the prime minister of breaking his 2010 manifesto pledge to "put a limit on the number of special advisers". "While he tells the rest of the country to accept cuts, he's happy to spend more and more on his own spin doctors. It's more evidence of how out of touch he is that he thinks the rules don't apply to him," he added. </body>

      <title>Parliament ticket firm gets £350,000</title>

      <body>Labour has questioned Parliament's relationship with a ticketing firm after it emerged the company had earned more than £350,000 in fees for selling tour tickets since the start of 2012. MP Luciana Berger said: "Taxpayers have a right to expect value for money. "The parliamentary authorities should look very closely at their ticketing arrangements and ensure they represent the best possible deal for the public." Visitors can book £16.50 advance tickets through Ticketmaster. It was revealed that Ticketmaster received £194,000 in fees last year, and £170,000 so far this year. Ms Berger said the fees paid to Ticketmaster represented a lot of money when there was huge pressure on public sector budgets. But spokesman for Parliament said the contract was decided by a competitive tender, won by Ticketmaster in 2009. He said: "The contract has recently gone out to tender again. Bids are in the process of being evaluated. The objective, as with all procurements, is to get the best deal." Parliament sold advance tickets worth almost £2m over the period. Members of the public can also arrange tours for free with their MP, or queue for tickets to the public gallery of the House of Commons. </body>

      <title>US spying 'may harm terror fight'</title>
      <description>EU leaders meeting in Brussels say distrust of the US over spying could harm intelligence-gathering in the fight against terrorism.</description>

      <body>EU leaders meeting in Brussels said distrust of the US over spying could harm the fight against terrorism. A statement agreed by the leaders said that "a lack of trust could prejudice" intelligence-gathering co-operation. German spy chiefs are travelling to Washington next week to press for action over the alleged monitoring of Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone. Both Germany and France want talks with the US to find a new "understanding" by the end of the year. As well as the bugging of Mrs Merkel's phone, there are claims the US National Security Agency (NSA) has monitored millions of telephone calls by both German and French citizens. Spain on Friday followed Germany and France in summoning the US ambassador to explain reports of spying on the country. The UK's Guardian newspaper has reported that it obtained a confidential memo from the NSA suggesting it had monitored the phones of 35 world leaders. The latest revelations have been sourced to US whistleblower Edward Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who fled the country earlier this year and is now in Russia. US state department spokesperson Jen Psaki said a review of US intelligence gathering, called for by President Obama, would look at how it affects foreign policy. The "high level group of outside experts... will consider as part of this how we can maintain the public's trust, how the surveillance impacts our foreign policy, particularly in an age when more and more information is becoming public," she said. The EU leaders' statement, released earlier on Friday, reflected their conclusions following talks on Thursday. It said the recent intelligence issues had raised "deep concerns" among European citizens. The statement said the leaders "underlined the close relationship between Europe and the USA and the value of that partnership". "[The leaders] stressed that intelligence-gathering is a vital element in the fight against terrorism," it continued. And it went on: "A lack of trust could prejudice the necessary cooperation in the field of intelligence-gathering." "The heads of state or government took note of the intention of France and Germany to seek bilateral talks with the USA with the aim of finding before the end of the year an understanding on mutual relations in that field," the leaders' statement also said. "They noted that other EU countries are welcome to join this initiative." French President Francois Hollande said the aim of the initiative "is about knowing about the past and setting a framework for the future and putting an end to monitoring mechanisms that are not controlled". Germany and France said they are proposing talks with the US to settle the row by the end of the year. But Mrs Merkel stressed Berlin and Paris would be making their own separate approaches to Washington. BBC Europe editor Gavin Hewitt says the French and Germans are looking for a new set of rules with a "no spying pact" at the core. He says this would mirror an arrangement the United States has had with Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada since just after World War II. That secret intelligence-sharing operation is known as Five Eyes. Mrs Merkel said she did not know the exact details of the Five Eyes arrangement so could not say whether that is exactly what Germany is seeking, but added: "We need something clear-cut, in line with the spirit of an alliance". UK Prime Minister David Cameron acknowledged the UK's "unique partnership" with the US regarding security but said: "I understand what others want to do and support that, as I think does President Obama". When asked by the BBC if the US had ever monitored Mr Cameron's phone, White House National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said: "His communications have not, are not and will not be monitored by the US." 'Look to the future' The spying revelations have overshadowed other issues at the EU summit in Brussels, including the Mediterranean migration problem, which framed the agenda of Friday's talks. Italian authorities said they had intercepted some 800 migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean as the EU leaders prepared to meet. A number leaders indicated their support for the French and German position. Belgian Prime Minister Elio di Rupo said: "The objective must remain the same - to fight against terrorism but also respect privacy. "Everyone can understand the need for exceptional measures given the danger of terrorism... but we are not in the position where we should spy on each other." Swedish PM Fredrik Reinfeldt said it was "completely unacceptable" to eavesdrop on the leader of an ally, a view echoed by Italian PM Enrico Letta, who added: "We want the truth." Other leaders signalled the need to move on. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said: "The main thing is that we look to the future. The trans-Atlantic partnership was, and is, important." Mrs Merkel had raised her concerns with US President Barack Obama in a call on Wednesday. White House spokesman Jay Carney later said Mr Obama had assured Mrs Merkel that her phone was not being listened to now and would not be in the future. However, his statement left open the question of whether calls had been listened to in the past. </body>

      <body>David Cameron has won the backing of EU chief Jose Manuel Barroso for his push to limit the number of new regulations coming out of Brussels. The two chaired a meeting of EU leaders on the issue at Friday's summit. The prime minister has said firms are being "throttled" by red tape and for every regulation and directive introduced another should be removed. Mr Barroso said more needed to be done to ensure "lighter, simpler, cheaper, common-sense regulation". The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, has said it has already cut 5,590 regulations since 2005. Mr Cameron is committed to renegotiating the UK's relationship with the EU if the Conservative Party wins the next election, ahead of an "in-out" referendum on whether the country should remain a member. In the meantime, he is promising to work to reduce the bureaucracy facing companies. Conservative sources say he wants to see 1,500 regulations reviewed. Eighty business leaders, including the chairmen of BT and Asda, have signed a letter calling for a "strong commitment" by the government towards this and several have accompanied Mr Cameron to Brussels to make the case. The prime minister has made the issue the central objective of the two-day European Council meeting. He held one-to-one meetings with the leaders of Germany and the Netherlands, who share similar views on deregulation, and co-chaired a meeting with the leaders of Poland, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy and Estonia, who are also sympathetic. "The Commission has done an excellent job in lifting the burden of bureaucracy. Now I want to get business engaged," he said, adding that a faster pace of deregulation was essential to getting firms to "compete and succeed". Mr Barroso, the Commission's president, said he appreciated that businesses needed a single set of rules, rather than 28 different bodies of national regulation, for the single market to work and for the important digital economy to continue to grow. Acknowledging that "useless laws weaken necessary laws", he said there were other areas where it was necessary to cut bureaucracy without reducing standards of consumer protection, health and safety and environmental concerns. "That is why we have to slash red tape," he said. </body>

      <title>Serco chief executive stands down</title>
      <description>The boss of security firm Serco resigns after accusations of overcharging the government tens of millions of pounds for electronic tags for criminals.</description>

      <body>The chief executive at Serco, a security firm at the centre of an overcharging scandal, has resigned. Outgoing boss Chris Hyman said the best way for the company to move forward "is for me to step back". Serco is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) after claims it had overcharged the government by "tens of millions" of pounds for electronic tags for criminals. The government welcomed the news, describing it as a "positive move". In July, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said an audit had revealed a "significant anomaly in the billing practices" of both Serco and rival G4S. Mr Grayling said that since 2005, the companies had in some cases been charging for tagging offenders who were in prison, had left the country or were even dead. In September, the government handed information to the SFO for their assessment. On Friday, Serco announced plans to reorganise the company. The firm said it would split the government work into a separate business that could be more closely monitored. For the moment, Mr Hyman's position will be taken over by Ed Casey, who runs the US division, while the company looks for an external full-time replacement. A government statement said it would "take full account of all the changes Serco have made today". "Whilst it is early days in their programme of renewal, this is a positive move by Serco and a step forward." The statement added that its review of government contracts, announced in July by the Justice Secretary, was continuing and would "ensure government's contractual arrangements are robust and taxpayers' money is spent responsibly, in a vibrant, competitive market for public services". Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan called for ministers to provide assurances that no confidentiality deals or "other arrangements that avoided justice" were being done. Mr Khan also asked ministers to "publish immediately the PriceWaterhouseCooper report into the activities of G4S and Serco." Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz said he was "surprised" by the resignation of Mr Hyman, because he "always maintained there is nothing untoward with the contracts Serco holds with the government". He said Mr Hyman maintained the position "even after the company was referred by Secretary of State for Justice to the SFO". Shares in Serco, which has in excess of 120,000 staff in more than 30 countries, rose after the news. It has lost more than 10% of its value since May - when the government first voiced its concerns over the tagging contract. "They were always going to have to make some sort of major change," Cantor analyst Sam Thomas said. "This is about transforming their recently damaged reputation and I think in appointing an external new chief executive they are hoping to draw a line under the previous issues." Mr Hyman said he had "always put the interests of Serco first", adding that it was important the relationship with the government was rebuilt. He said: "I have been fortunate enough to have had the privilege of working at a great company with extremely talented people. I wish everyone at Serco the very best for the future." No new contracts are being awarded to either of the firms until the audit is completed, the government said in September. The UK chief executive at G4S, Richard Morris, also stepped down on Thursday. The latest development in the scandal is likely to fuel debate over the value to the government of outsourcing public services to private companies, after G4S failed to provide enough security staff for the 2012 Olympics. </body>

      <body>Fuel poverty campaigners have written to Prime Minister David Cameron demanding cross-party action on the "national crisis" of cold homes. Campaigners said the UK was second only to Estonia for people struggling to pay their energy bills across Europe. It came as Public Health England urged people to keep their homes well heated this winter to avoid potentially fatal health problems. It said living rooms should be 21C (70F) and other home areas 18C (65F). Campaign group Energy Bill Revolution - an alliance of charities including Age UK and Barnardos - said the biggest problem in the UK was "leaky homes" and called for investment in a domestic insulation programme. Energy Bill Revolution said "woeful" levels of insulation had left Britain falling way behind comparable European countries such as Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands. Campaign director Ed Matthew said: "Our political leaders are falling over themselves to come up with headline-grabbing ways to cut energy bills yet they fall woefully short of a true solution to the energy bill crisis. "By far the biggest opportunity to cut energy bills is to fully insulate the UK's leaky homes. No other investment can do so much for so many. If the government is serious about solving this crisis they must make insulating homes the UK's number one infrastructure priority." Public Health England's advice came in its Cold Weather Plan for 2013, after four of the big six energy companies announced price rises. Age UK said older people in particular were increasingly anxious about the cost of heating their homes. Winter health risks range from flu to falls - but the cold can also make heart and respiratory problems much worse. On average there are about 24,000 excess winter deaths in England each year, many of which experts say are preventable. The plan has been produced in collaboration with the Department of Health, NHS England and the Local Government Association. It contains advice for the NHS and local government, as well as individuals. This includes having your flu vaccination if you are in an at-risk group, ensuring homes are properly insulated and making sure heating systems are routinely checked. From November, the Met Office will issue cold weather alerts if the temperature dips to 2C (35F) or less, or if there is severe winter weather such as heavy snow or widespread ice. Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection and medical director at Public Health England, said: "In colder weather, keeping yourself warm is essential to staying healthy, especially for the very young, older people or those with a chronic condition such as heart disease and asthma." Public health minister Jane Ellison said: "The elderly and those with long-term illnesses are particularly at risk during winter months so it's crucial that people stay warm." Age UK's charity director Caroline Abrahams said: "Being cold is a huge health risk for older people so it is absolutely essential that older people stay warm during the winter months. "But with fuel poverty blighting the lives of millions of households in the UK many older people are feeling increasingly anxious about the rising cost of energy. "The government must show it has a clear long-term plan to make low income homes more energy efficient." Labour's shadow energy and climate change minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: "People are being left in real hardship because David Cameron won't stand up to the energy companies. "Britain's energy is market is not working for families and business." </body>

      <body>Labour has won the Scottish Parliament by-election in Dunfermline, after beating the SNP by almost 3,000 votes. The victory represented a gain from the SNP, who took the seat in the 2011 Holyrood election. The by-election was caused by the resignation of sitting MSP Bill Walker, who was thrown out of the SNP and jailed for domestic abuse. Cara Hilton, the parliament's newest MSP, said the people of Dunfermline "deserved better". The SNP won Dunfermline as part of its landslide election win in 2011 with a majority of just 590 votes, but was not able to hold on. In the end, Labour took the seat with a majority of 2,873 - a 7% swing from the SNP. The Liberal Democrats came third in the contest, with the Conservatives in fourth place. Ms Hilton said: "After the disgrace of Bill Walker, Dunfermline deserves better and I will ensure that we will be better - far better than what went before." And ahead of the SNP administration's independence referendum next year, she added: "We need a Scottish government that will address the needs of Scots, not one that will simply make promises about what will happen after 2016. "Today Dunfermline has sent a message to Bute House and Alex Salmond: it's time for you to focus on the real priorities of Scots, not your constitutional obsession." The by-election campaign centred on contentious local issues, including proposed school closures, while the SNP focused on its national policies such as the council tax freeze and the decision to remove the tolls on the nearby Forth Road Bridge. Despite the result, SNP candidate Shirley-Anne Somerville said she was proud of the campaign she fought. "We've run a positive campaign trying to support local parents in their schools and I hope we can come together, all of us in the party, to make sure those three schools in the Dunfermline constituency stay open," she said. The Liberal Democrats saw their vote drop by 8% on the night. Candidate Susan Leslie said: "I think it has been a victory for women in politics in Scotland that four women stood in this by-election and fought positive campaigns on the issues for Dunfermline." Scottish Conservative candidate James Reekie - whose party saw a 1% increase in its vote - added: "When the people of Dunfermline are faced with the dilemma of Labour and the SNP, they chose the Conservatives." Turnout in the by-election was 42.65%. </body>

      <title>East Coast rail sale gets under way</title>
      <description>Re-privatising the East Coast Main line will "revitalise" it, ministers say as they kick-start the franchising process, but Labour and unions attack the move.</description>

      <body>Returning the East Coast Main line to the private sector will "revitalise" it, ministers have said as they kick-started the franchising process. The line has been publicly run since 2009 when National Express handed back the franchise amid financial problems. Ministers say the line has since been "stabilised" but they now want to "rekindle the spirit of competition". Labour and the unions say the move is "ideological" and the line should remain in public ownership. They say the failure of two successive operators to make the line - which runs from London to Edinburgh, with connected services to Inverness and Aberdeen - commercially viable and its improved performance in recent years show it can succeed under public ownership. The government began the franchising process on Friday by releasing information about the line's financial position as well as the basic criteria for interested parties and details of the commercial risks involved. The successful bidder is due to be announced in a year's time. The franchise is due to start in February 2015 and is expected to run for a maximum of 11 years. Among those reported to be interested in bidding is Eurostar, which runs services from London to the Continent. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said public ownership was never meant to be a permanent arrangement and returning the operation of the line to the private sector would bring more investment and innovation. "We want to see a revitalised East Coast railway, one that both rekindles the spirit of competition for customers on this great route and competes with the West Coast on speed, quality and customer service," he said. Since 2009, the line has been run by Directly Operated Railways, an arms-length company overseen by the Department for Transport. Figures in Friday's document suggest total journeys on the line have increased by a million to 19.1 million under public ownership while revenue has risen by 11% to £692m. In the year to October 2013, 89% of East Coast trains arrived at their final destination within 10 minutes of their advertised time, compared to a national average of 92%. Rail minister Stephen Hammond told the BBC the firm had done a "good job" but the East Coast "lagged behind" other long-distance operators in terms of punctuality while customer satisfaction was only "in line" with other routes. "There is a lot more that can be done," he said, adding that the doubling of rail passengers since privatisation in the 1990s showed the benefits of the franchise process. Critics of privatisation say the East Coast line has returned nearly £800m to the taxpayer under public ownership. But Mr Hammond said this was not a fair comparison as Network Rail had reduced charges for using the track substantially since National Express relinquished the franchise. The government says it is already planning "significant" investment in the line over the next six years, including new rolling stock, upgrades to the track around Peterborough and the rebuilding of Doncaster station. But it wants a private sector operator to "transform the customer experience", develop "innovative timetables" and identify further opportunities for improving stations along the 393-mile London to Edinburgh route. But Labour said the privatisation process - which was expected to be delayed until after the next election - was being driven by ideological reasons rather than the interests of passengers. The opposition say the government has "learnt nothing" from the debacle over the West Coast Main Line franchising process last year, which had to be abandoned after mistakes by civil servants led to flawed calculations. "We think it should be allowed to get on and act as a public sector comparator for the other rail franchises," shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh told the BBC News Channel. Asked why Labour had changed its policy since 2009, when it said public ownership was temporary, she argued the facts had changed. "We have been very surprised and happy with the directly operated railway...We think, at the very least, it should be able to bid for this franchise." The RMT union has pledged to fight the re-privatisation, saying the government is playing down the success of the line under public ownership in order to "bulldoze" the sale through. Earlier this month it claimed a leaked version of the draft sale brochure redacted sections highlighting the good punctuality and performance of the service under public ownership. "It is simply outrageous that the government are firing the starting gun on the re-privatisation of the East Coast when every objective analysis shows that this is a successful and reliable service," RMT boss Bob Crow said. And the TUC said the line needed an operator which would put passengers not shareholders first. "The government doesn't have one good argument for re-privatising the line and is yet again being blinded by outdated market dogma," said general secretary Frances O'Grady. But the Rail Delivery Group, which speaks on behalf of commercial train operators and Network Rail, said the rail network had been transformed under such a public-private business model. "This partnership is a winning formula that is delivering for passengers, businesses and the taxpayer," said the group's director general Michael Roberts. Consumer watchdog Passenger Focus said it would be scrutinising the tendering process very carefully. "It has never been more important that companies are publicly held to account for their passenger satisfaction ratings - these must be built into the very heart of the contract," said its chief executive Anthony Smith. "However, it is good to see the franchise process moving ahead again and unlocking much-needed investment." </body>

      <title>MEPs vote to suspend US data sharing</title>
      <description>A non-binding vote in the EU represents growing unease about the amount of data Europe has shared with the US.</description>

      <body>The European Parliament has voted to suspend the sharing of financial data with the US, following allegations that citizens' data was spied on. The allegation forms part of leaked documents from whistleblower Edward Snowden. The vote is non-binding but illustrates MEPs' growing unease over how much data was shared with the US. It comes a day after it was alleged that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone calls were monitored. The European Parliament voted to suspend its Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP) agreement with the US, in response to the alleged tapping of EU citizens' bank data held by the Belgian company SWIFT. The agreement granted the US authorities access to bank data for terror-related investigations but leaked documents made public by whistleblower Edward Snowden allege that the global bank transfer network was the target of wider US surveillance. MEPs also want to launch a full inquiry into the alleged spying. The row over exactly how much snooping was done on European citizens appears to be escalating. Germany has summoned the US ambassador in Berlin over the claims that the US monitored Mrs Merkel's mobile phone calls. Other leaders are also likely to want further clarification from Washington over the activities of its National Security Agency (NSA) in Europe. Meanwhile student group, europe v facebook, is launching a fresh attack on how deeply the social network was involved in the US spying programme. It has won the right for a review of why the Irish data protection commissioner is not investigating the amount of European data shared with the US. Commissioner Billy Hawkes has previously claimed that there "is nothing to investigate" over Facebook's role in the PRISM programme. Max Schrem, who heads the group, remains unconvinced. "When it comes to the fundamental rights of millions of users and the biggest surveillance scandal in years, he will have to take responsibility and do something about it," he said. </body>

      <title>Salmond 'certain' on Ineos deal</title>
      <description>First Minister Alex Salmond says he is "absolutely certain" that the petrochemical plant at Grangemouth can be saved.</description>

      <body>First Minister Alex Salmond has said he is "absolutely certain" that the petrochemical plant at Grangemouth can be saved. Staff are waiting to hear if owner Ineos will grant a reprieve to the closure-threatened operation. About 800 jobs are under threat - and the company has already laid off about 2,000 contractors since it shut down the complex. Ineos will update the staff on its plans at a meeting at 11:00. Speaking on the BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Salmond said: "I would now be very hopeful indeed that there will be a change in position from Ineos and I'm absolutely certain there's a future for chemicals in Grangemouth. "I believe there will be a change in position today and that will be a favourable change in position. "My reason for saying that is that everybody has been going that extra mile I called for. "Given that only 48 hours ago we were looking at a major industrial catastrophe in Scotland, I think we're in a much better position this Friday morning." Mr Salmond said the trade unions had offered that there would be no industrial action for three years. "That's an indication that however we got to this impasse two days ago, there has now been substantial movement of people anxious to save their jobs, their livelihoods and their plants," he told the programme. Political leaders had already expressed optimism after the union accepted a survival plan put forward by Ineos. The BBC understands that an agreement was being drawn up for workers to sign, which would need approval from major Ineos shareholder Jim Ratcliffe. On Thursday, Scotland's finance secretary John Swinney and the Scottish Secretary Alastair Carmichael held talks with unions and management at the site. Afterwards they said they were hopeful. However, Ineos is yet to confirm whether it will reverse its decision to close the petrochemical plant at the complex. An internal investigation by Ineos into the union convenor, Stephen Deans, is also due to be published later. It was the firm's treatment of Mr Deans that first ignited the breakdown in industrial relations - before it became a battle for the survival of Scotland's largest industrial site. The dispute at the site escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but Ineos shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a survival plan, which was initially rejected by union members. The proposals included ending their final salary pension scheme and cut shift allowances. Previously, Ineos said it was ready to invest £300m in Grangemouth if workers agreed to the new terms and conditions. The company said it had decided to close the plant because half the workforce had refused to accept the cost-cutting plan essential for the facility's survival. Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the neighbouring refinery would go as well. The refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. Ineos had said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week. </body>

      <body>The Respect party no longer has any councillors in Bradford after they all resigned, accusing George Galloway of defamation and lack of transparency. The five councillors, elected in a surge of local support for Respect last year, temporarily resigned in August but have now left the party altogether. Two were suspended over criticism of Mr Galloway's plans to stand for London mayor, and he questioned their loyalty. Respect said the councillors' conduct had been "unacceptable". The five councillors are Alyas Karmani, Ruqaya Collector, Faisal Khan, Ishtiaq Ahmed and Mohammed Shabbir. Speaking to The Guardian in August, they criticised Mr Galloway, saying he should step down as an MP if he wanted to fight in the 2016 London mayoral election. In response to the article, Mr Galloway accused the councillors of "destabilising the party" and "conniving with the Khans", in reference to his former aide Aisha Ali Khan and her police officer husband Det Insp Afiz Khan who have been charged with misconduct offences. Mr Ahmed and Mr Shabbir were suspended by national party managers the same day. In a statement issued on Friday the councillors said they had been in discussions with senior party officials over the past two months to address their concerns about the "unwarranted" suspensions, "defamatory" statements made about them and a "failure to develop transparent operations structures and procedures to enable the party to work effectively in Bradford". They said: "Regrettably, these discussions have failed to find common ground as senior Respect officials have shown a disregard to address our legitimate grievances and we have been unable to resolve our issues of difference. "After much deliberation this has left our group no choice but to fully resign from the Respect party with immediate effect." The councillors said they would continue as independents for the remainder of their terms. Respect said talks between party officials and the councillors had "foundered on the unacceptable conduct of the councillors", who it accused of regularly speaking out against the party. It said Mr Ahmed and Mr Shabir were expelled by the party on Thursday, the day the councillors say they informed officials of their resignation. A Respect statement said the councillors' visibility and impact in the council chamber "has been virtually non-existent". "If they had a shred of principle they would now resign their council seats and stand again in their new colours. Or will they instead continue to draw thousands of pounds of public money until they are removed by the voters?" </body>

      <body>The Northern Ireland Executive has been challenged to reform how it delivers key infrastructure projects such as roads and energy links as a matter of urgency. CBI Northern Ireland said it was "incredibly frustrated at the lack of an appropriate pipeline of works" that would attract investment and new jobs. It has published a new report, calling for several projects to be prioritised. The projects include a second north-south electricity inter-connector. CBI Northern Ireland believes a new Stormont agency should be created and charged with the procurement and delivery of major projects. The agency would report directly to the finance minister. Other schemes the CBI wants action on are strategic roads like the York Street interchange in Belfast and the A6 road to Londonderry. CBI vice-chair Adrian Eakin said: "Relatively simple steps can make our system more fit for purpose and project a view to investors that Northern Ireland is a place which puts delivery of infrastructure top of its agenda. "Northern Ireland cannot afford to be behind the curve." The organisation said the Northern Ireland Executive should explore all avenues of funding such as the European Investment Bank. Its ideas are contained in its new report called Infrastructure - Investing for our Future. </body>

      <title>Sharp rise in council's rent arrears</title>
      <description>North Lanarkshire Council claims more than 2,000 of its tenants are in rent arrears for the first time after housing benefit changes.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24662376</url>
      <date>1382706036</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70698000/jpg/_70698042_houses.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>More than 2,000 people in one part of Scotland have got into rent arrears for the first time since changes to housing benefit were made in the spring. North Lanarkshire Council thinks it is owed £675,000 from tenants because of the spare room subsidy - dubbed the bedroom tax, by critics. The council is the largest local authority landlord in Scotland. It also believes many people who could be eligible for help to deal with their benefit cut have not applied for it. This is the most detailed assessment so far of the impact of the changes on one council area in Scotland. More than 5,000 council tenants in North Lanarkshire lost some of their housing benefit in April because they were deemed to have spare bedrooms. An analysis produced by the council - covering the six months up to September - said 2,333 tenants who previously had no rent arrears owed the authority money by September. A further 1,100 already had rent arrears before the changes took place. This meant that 3,449 of the 5,201 people who lost some of their housing benefit in North Lanarkshire had rent arrears. Overall, rent arrears over the past six months were up by two thirds compared to the same period last year though the council was stressing the changes to housing benefit were only one reason for this. Tenants now owe the council more than £2.5m in total. The council said about £675,000 of these arrears could be the result of the benefit changes. However, the council also believes that some people who could have been helped by the special discretionary housing payments, available to those affected by the benefit changes, may not have applied for them. This means that some of the arrears may have been avoidable - or that there could have been help for people who have struggled to make up for the loss of benefit. North Lanarkshire said it would not evict tenants solely because of spare room subsidy arrears during this financial year as long as they had contacted the housing service for assistance and advice. A spokesman said: "Clearly the UK government's welfare reforms are already having a significant effect on our tenants. "The council has set aside funds to assist vulnerable people in every way possible but it is essential that tenants who are worried or in difficulty talk to us. "We have hired additional trained advisers who can discuss each case and provide help with applications for financial assistance. We have already helped thousands of people, so anyone who needs that assistance should contact their local housing office." Council leader Jim McCabe condemned the UK government's changes to housing benefit but urged people who have been affected to speak to the council to see if help could be provided. The council has nearly £1.2m available to hand out in these payments - £470,000 of it is from the UK government, the rest is from the council's own budget. So far it has paid out £350,000 in these payments to nearly 2,900 people. Separate figures from the council give some indication of the scale of the arrears that individuals are building up. As of last week, about 460 people have arrears equivalent to the cut in their benefit while 500 have built up new arrears since April of an even greater amount. The other tenants with arrears appear to have tried to make up some of the shortfall or have received help. The Scottish Conservatives' welfare spokesman Alex Johnstone MSP said the figures showed that the issue of welfare reform was not as black and white as the Scottish government, and what he called the "left-wing establishment", would like to make out. Mr Johnstone said: "Welfare reform is a challenge that must be addressed so that it is fair to those who receive, and fair on those who pay for it. "The ever-growing cost of the welfare budget is something which successive governments have failed to address. "But the 'ignore the problem and it might go away' approach simply hasn't worked and has only resulted in fostering a culture of people being left to languish on benefits for years." A spokesperson for the UK Department for Work and Pensions said: "Scotland has been given £10m this year to help vulnerable people and we are monitoring this spending carefully to ensure that tenants get the support they need during welfare reforms. "It is important to remember that housing benefit will still cover the vast majority of people's rent, but the taxpayer can no longer afford to pay for spare bedrooms. "People have a number of options available to them, including moving to another property in the public or private sector, or making up the difference in rent through going into work or working more hours." Scottish Housing Minister Margaret Burgess said: "We know that 80% of households affected by the bedroom tax contain an adult with a recognised disability, and over 15,000 children are affected. "That's why have consistently expressed our opposition to this measure. "The Scottish government is doing all it can to help the people hit by the bedroom tax, with £20m of funding available this year and a further £20m available next year." </body>

      <body>A Welsh government minister has been criticised for giving "evasive" answers to an assembly committee. The assembly's environment committee said Natural Resources Minister Alun Davies gave them contradictory information about his portfolio. Members condemned his department for financial management and planning failures, including "basic errors" in its draft budget. The Welsh government said issues raised were "flawed and inaccurate". In a letter to the Finance Committee about the Natural Resources department's budget, the AMs said: "We are disappointed with the timeliness of information provided by the minister, and the oral evidence session, where a number of questions were evaded or contradictory information provided. "We believe that this is an indicator of problems at the heart of financial management and planning of this department and we will continue to keep a very close eye on these issues both in-year and at future budget rounds. "We believe the department's approach to financial management hinders general transparency. We are therefore unable to assess whether the budget is appropriately prioritised and is providing value for money." Mr Davies was criticised after £342m of farm subsidy payments were left out of the government's supplementary budget earlier this year due to what he called an "administrative error". Committee members said that while the minister said there would be no impact on farmers, "there is a discrepancy between officials and the minister about whether or not this shortfall will need to be covered from other areas within the Welsh Government budget". The Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, William Powell, said that Mr Davies' performance before the Environment Committee was "embarrassing" and showed a "lack of competence". "The Minister's budget included a number of basic errors, such as referring to schemes and policy areas that have ceased to exist," said Mr Powell. The Welsh government responded strongly to the critical letter. A spokesperson said: "The majority of the issues raised are simply flawed and inaccurate and we do not accept them. "The content and tone of the letter are also wholly misleading. "The Minister for Natural Resources and Food will be writing to the Chair of the Environment Committee shortly to address the issues raised." </body>

      <title>Heseltine plea on 'decaying' towns</title>
      <description>A magazine article which suggested that government money should no longer be spent on some deprived English towns and cities is criticised by former cabinet minister Lord Heseltine.</description>

      <body>The former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine has dismissed claims that "failing" towns and cities should be abandoned by the government. An article in The Economist suggested that a number of industrial towns were "decaying" and their inhabitants should be encouraged to find jobs elsewhere. The magazine listed Hull, Burnley, Middlesbrough and Hartlepool as places where "dollops of public money" had failed to boost the local economy, despite years of heroic effort. The article has caused an outcry in Hull, where the city council leader described its recommendations as "disgusting". In an interview for the Sunday Politics in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, Lord Heseltine said similar claims were made about Liverpool in the 1980s. Michael Heseltine was appointed by Margaret Thatcher to lead the regeneration of Liverpool, following riots in the city in 1981. The former Conservative cabinet minister claims the best way to stimulate economic growth in deprived towns and cities is to devolve more power away from Whitehall. Lord Heseltine said: "What I have argued over decades is that we should say to cities what would you do? "Because you know what Leeds needs, what Bradford needs and what Hull needs." Former Liverpool MP Peter Kilfoyle told me there had been numerous calls over the years to turn-off the government spending taps on Merseyside. Mr Kilfoyle, who served as a Labour minister under Tony Blair, said: "We had a think-tank a few years ago which said that Liverpool should be abandoned and everybody should move to the south. "This is nonsense. Any forward looking government would want to invest in Hull, just as they invested in Liverpool." Cabinet papers from 1981 reveal the chancellor of the exchequer at the time - Sir Geoffrey Howe - raised the possibility of a programme of "managed decline" in Liverpool. However, Lord Howe recently said there was never a suggestion that Liverpool should be abandoned by the Conservative government in the 1980s. </body>

      <title>Labour councils and Pickles in row</title>
      <description>As Labour-run local authorities warn over new cuts, Eric Pickles accuses them of "shroud waving".</description>

      <body>The battle lines are being drawn. Within the next few months, our large local authorities will outline where the spending axe will fall on local services. It's become an annual fixture in the political calendar. By the end of this parliament, councils will have seen their budgets squeezed by one third, with the prospect of further cuts after the next general election. But in the East Midlands, there are two new players. Both Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire are now Labour controlled; and since the party's victory in May's local elections, hardly a day has passed without a dire warning of the tough choices having to be taken by the new leadership to balance the books. The Communities Secretary Eric Pickles this week got his retaliation in first. He told MPs that complaining Labour authorities were more interested in "shroud-waving" and cutting front-line services. He's also been brushing down his "50 Ways to Save", his guide to councils to make the most of their budgets. It'll be no surprise that the leader of Derbyshire county council, Labour's Anne Western, takes a very different view of the financial challenges facing her authority in the next budget round. "You can either shrink and shrink your services until there's nothing left, or we can reinvent what we do," she told me. "In the six months since we took control, we've been talking to partners like the NHS. Our priority is what the people of Derbyshire want." That may be music to the ears of the Communities Secretary. He's been encouraging councils to reach out to other organisations to share costs. "To be frank, this is the future," he said. "It makes sense to work together on procurement, joint use of offices and shared services." One key area for Anne Western is the provision of council-run residential care services for the elderly. Derbyshire has 26 such care homes and spends £72m annually on care services, one of the highest of any shire county. Many of its neighbouring authorities have already sold-off or part-privatised the service. Anne Western said: "People get a huge sense of confidence when the service is council-run because of the quality of the staff and the training. It's also more accountable." Only a few weeks ago, the prime minister dismissed warnings from Anne Western over the consequences of budget cuts on services and jobs in Derbyshire. He described additional council cuts following the chancellor's budget as "relatively modest". "He's just playing with numbers," replied Anne Western. "It's not just me as a Labour leader. There are Conservative leaders up and down the country arguing the case for a rethink on budgets." Rethink? From the Communities Secretary? That may look unlikely. What's more likely is Eric Pickles quoting from a recent BBC/ ICM survey . It indicated that many people believe local council services - rubbish collection, libraries and schools - have actually improved in the past few years. In the months ahead, watch out for those battle lines being drawn. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Beginner's guide to PM's speech</title>
      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21013771</url>

      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant? What has happened? Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning. Why the big deal about the speech? Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech. So what did Cameron say? Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech. What sorts of powers does the UK want back? The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK." Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders? The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK. So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU? David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market." What has been the reaction in the UK? Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement. Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party. The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts. What about the reaction around Europe? The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction. What about the reaction from business? A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".

      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle. The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011. As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign. Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury. Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011. Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development. Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. The MP for Leeds West was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament. A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader. As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest. One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress. Moving to defence from shadow Northern Ireland secretary in October 2013, the MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted having smoked cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip. The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011. One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the Cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. She supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leader of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. Chris Leslie has been appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the latest Labour frontbench reshuffle. The former Bradford councillor was elected MP for Shipley - a Tory stronghold in Yorkshire - in 1997. He held several junior positions in the former Labour government within the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He lost his Shipley seat in 2005, but re-entered Parliament in 2010 as MP for Nottingham East. He went on to serve as shadow financial secretary to the Treasury on Labour's front bench in the Commons. Mary Creagh has moved from shadow environment secretary to shadow transport secretary in October 2013. When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest. Maria Eagle moved in October 2013 to shadow environment secretary in a job swap with Mary Creagh. She is the sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. She held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player. Jim Murphy was moved - demoted in many people's eyes - in October 2013 from shadow defence secretary. He is a Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign. He has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football. Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008. In Holyrood, she held various posts, including minister for communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws. Before entering politics she was a lecturer in community education. The then 52-year-old took up her first full shadow cabinet role in October 2011. Jon Trickett takes over from the departing Tom Watson as deputy Labour party chair. Gordon Brown's former parliamentary aide, Mr Trickett previously attended shadow cabinet as a junior minister and became a full member as shadow Cabinet Office minister in Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle. The then 61-year-old MP for Hemsworth took over the role from Tessa Jowell. Michael Dugher became shadow Cabinet Office minister in October 2013 after attending the shadow cabinet as shadow minister without portfolio. Mr Dugher won the seat of Barnsley East at the 2010 General Election, after serving as chief political spokesman for the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Having joined the ranks of the Labour parliamentary party, he then became a parliamentary private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband. He is also currently vice-chairman of the Labour Party. Gloria De Piero was appointed shadow women and equalities minister in the October 2013 reshuffle. The former GMTV political editor was an political admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as party leader. She was elected as MP for Ashfield at the 2010 General Election and appointed to a junior role in the shadow Department for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport. Since October 2011, Ms De Piero has served as a junior shadow Home Office minister. Former BBC radio producer and special adviser who has risen quickly through the ranks. The then 40-year-old was elected in 2010 for Pontypridd, but previously stood unsuccessfully in the 2006 Blaenau Gwent by-election where he lost to independent Dai Davies. He supported Ed Miliband for the leadership and was given a role in his shadow team five months after entering the House, first as shadow Wales minister and then in the shadow Treasury team. This is his first shadow cabinet role. Moving from shadow minister for international development in October 2013, former charity worker and chief executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation, Mr Lewis held a string of junior ministerial posts in the Labour government after becoming an MP in 1997 at the age of 31. He started out as a parliamentary private secretary to then Trade Secretary Stephen Byers, before going on to be an education minister, Treasury minister, health minister and international development minister. Most recently, he was minister of state at the Foreign Office. His previous shadow cabinet role was as culture spokesman in which he was a vocal campaigner on phone hacking. The then 52-year-old was elected unopposed in a ballot for chief whip in 2010. A former local government minister, the Doncaster Central MP is responsible for maintaining discipline among Labour MPs in crucial Commons votes. Continues to lead her party in the Lords, having done the job, while in government, under Gordon Brown. She is also a spokesman on education, work and pensions, Northern Ireland and equality issues. Born in 1955, she started her political career as a special adviser to Neil - now Lord - Kinnock in the 1980s. A long-serving leader of Brighton and Hove Council, Lord Bassam was given a peerage in 1997 at the age of 44. The former local government official has continued as Labour's chief whip in the Lords, having done the job since before the 2010 general election. </body>

      <body>The 2014 European elections look set to see more anti-EU MEPs elected to the parliament in Brussels, bringing more allies to UKIP as it speaks of beating all three of Britain's longer-established parties. It is not clear how well the eurosceptics will get along - UKIP has said it will not work with the far right parties from France and the Netherlands - and not all of them want their country to leave the EU. Pro-European parties fear the eurosceptics may try to clog up the institution. Giles Dilnot reports from Strasbourg.

      <body>France and Germany have announced they are to seek new rules for intelligence co-operation with the United States following their dispute with Washington over spying. The move follows revelations that US intelligence agencies may have been monitoring the mobile phone of the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and millions of French phone calls. The former security minister, Lord West, told the Today programme while the events are embarrassing they come as no surprise: "Clearly it's extremely embarrassing when something is written down on paper which shows, does seem to show that they were trying to collect information on the phones of those particular people." "I've always worked on the assumption... that people were listening to my phone calls and trying to get information from me; and I know they jolly well were," he said. "It's a reality of the nasty world we live in," he added. First broadcast on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday 25 October 2013. </body>

      <title>How do leaders cope with bugging?</title>
      <description>Why world leaders don't like using secure phones</description>

      <body>The most common reaction to news that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged by the US National Security Agency appears to be world-weary resignation. Followed by a sly suggestion that someone of her experience and stature should have known better. Kurt Volker, former US ambassador to Nato 2008-2009, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme "every country spies" and he could not believe that the revelations were a surprise to anyone. Lord West, a security minister under Gordon Brown, said he had "always worked on the assumption" that people were listening to his phone calls. "I know they jolly well were," he told Today. "I don't think it's surprising that people try and listen. If you are a head of state there are lots of people, not just other states, who are listening. "There are companies, all sorts of people, who want to hear what you are saying and I think you have to be extremely careful." A former senior British diplomat, who did not want to be named, told the BBC News website he always worked on the assumption that his phone calls were being listened to. This could sometimes be turned to the British delegation's advantage, he explained, by reinforcing the message that they were trying to get across in negotiations in supposedly private phone conversations, knowing full well that they would be intercepted. But at the same time, it was worth remembering when reading reports of what the representatives of other nations were saying that they were probably up to the same game, he added. Former Home Secretary David Blunkett recently revealed that Nicolas Sarkozy, the then French interior minister, tried to save time in negotiations over the closure of the Sangatte transit camp by saying he already knew the British position because the French secret service had intercepted unencrypted Home Office emails. But not everyone is quite so sanguine. Clare Short, who made headlines and provoked fury in Downing Street in 2004 when she revealed that the British secret service had bugged the office and telephone of then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, says she was genuinely "shocked" by the Merkel revelations. The former international development secretary also rejects the argument that Mrs Merkel's anger is for the benefit of the German public, many of whom are still haunted by the memory of the Stasi. "I am sure she was very angry and upset. These were her friends and now [she finds] they don't trust her," says Ms Short. Ms Short said she was regularly given intelligence reports about what Mr Annan was saying in the supposed privacy of his office but she became increasingly uncomfortable about this in the run-up to the Iraq war. She recalls the surreal and disturbing experience of chatting to Kofi Annan on her mobile phone and realising that someone would probably be listening in and transcribing every word. She says she can not recall any examples of being handed intelligence reports about what friendly powers were saying to each other on the phone during her time in office, from 1997 to 2003. But she says she was approached by "successive Cs" - the code name for the head of MI6 - offering to spy on the leaders of friendly nations in Africa. "I told them, 'No of course not. We don't want to spy on the people we are working with,'" she tells the BBC News website. She also explodes one popular myth about notorious technophobe Tony Blair - that he did not carry a mobile phone during his years in power. "I don't really believe that," she says, adding that it might be part of Downing Street myth-making: "It makes him more emperor-like." All heads of state, in the Western world at least, will have access to encrypted mobile phones and other secure lines. The problem, for security staff, is convincing world leaders to take the espionage threat seriously. Shortly after taking office in 2008, Barack Obama managed to convince the secret service to let him keep his own Blackberry, despite fears it would broadcast his location and make him vulnerable to hacking. Mr Obama is said to be frustrated about having to live in the White House "bubble", cut off from the outside world and unable to communicate with normal people. The President's Blackberry is often seen on his belt and he is sometimes pictured scrolling through his messages as he travels in his limousine. In France, senior officials have access to a secure intranet and phone network - but the country's leaders are reported to be reluctant to use the slow and restrictive system, which can take up to 30 seconds to place a call. President Francois Hollande is said to have followed predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy by holding on to his personal smartphone. Mobile phones are banned in No 10 - you have to hand them in at the door - over fears foreign powers are listening in. All calls in and out are routed through a secure switchboard staffed by officials - a system which continues when the prime minister is travelling. Downing Street is remaining tight-lipped about the latest bugging revelations. Asked earlier if the prime minister was still using his mobile phone, Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: "I haven't seen him use a different one". </body>

      <title>Red tape, not red lines</title>
      <description>A different focus for David Cameron at the EU summit?</description>

      <body>Time and again British leaders would come to Brussels pledging to defend their "red lines" in negotiations. As these had often been thrashed out in advance behind the scenes, they could go home with "victory" secured. This time it isn't red lines, but red tape. David Cameron is coming to the EU summit threatening to "hold Brussels' feet to the fire". For the prime minister, that fire would preferably be a bonfire of regulations. He will be flanked by two members of his business task force - Marc Bolland of MandS, and Dale Murray, an investor in new enterprises - and their message will be that growth is being held back across the continent because of the burdens placed on wealth-creating companies. But the European Commission is wondering what all the fuss is about. Its centre-right President Jose Manuel Barroso says he has cut 5,000 regulations in recent years. He would take personal credit for stopping new health and safety restrictions on hairdressers which could have stopped them wearing high heels at work. And he's grounded a directive on soil that had been discussed for the past eight years. The Commission says that the debate on deregulation shouldn't take up too much time at the summit, but David Cameron will be spending quite a bit of his time in Brussels talking about it. This includes a meeting on the margins with Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, and the leaders of some other northern European countries who want to see further cuts in regulation - and new rules headed off. But David Cameron has made great play of not just reducing the burden of regulation, but suggesting that there are some areas where Brussels shouldn't be regulating at all. To the delight and relief of many of his backbenchers who have been viewing UKIP's rise with trepidation, he promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Brussels ahead of the referendum he'll hold on EU membership if he is still prime minister in 2017. But the Commission says that, while he has talked to them about EU-wide regulations, he has barely uttered a word on the repatriation of powers. There has been a discussion on what justice measures UK ministers will opt in to, having said they would exercise the blanket opt-out bequeathed to them by Tony Blair. But beyond that, nothing. No mention of the economic and social measures that it had been assumed that Britain wanted back - for example on working hours. Now, Downing Street has a rather straightforward response. The means of renegotiating would come through any further attempts to alter EU treaties. For example if Mrs Merkel wanted a new treaty to incorporate the recent inter-governmental arrangements on the eurozone, Britain would seize the opportunity to ask for something in return for their agreement. But with a new German coalition not yet in place, treaty change hasn't been on the agenda. Privately some Conservatives suspect that the difficulty of renegotiating - and getting the agreement of 27 other countries - might be concentrating the prime minister's mind. Therefore, if he can argue that he has taken the lead in changing Brussels for the better - and that they have joined with him in making the EU more business friendly, then there is perhaps less need to grab back some powers. He could then go in to the referendum, if it is held, arguing that EU is a very different beast from the one he was dealing with at the time of his Europe speech, thanks to the alliance he has built with northern European nations and centre-right governments. Downing Street insists there has been no shift in position. </body>

      <title>Consulting... and ignoring</title>
      <description>What is the point of government consultations?</description>

      <body>What is the point of government consultations? I pose the question at the end of a week in which ministers responded to three official consultations on three controversial proposals - and appeared to ignore the results from them all. On Monday, the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) published its response to a consultation on planned changes to the assessment of people with disabilities in determining their entitlement to benefits. The government had conducted the consultation, it said, "in a fully open-minded manner". Ministers had carefully considered all the views expressed. The consultation focused on plans limiting entitlement to extra help for mobility needs to those who cannot walk 20m. The overwhelming response was that this was a bad idea. "Respondents felt there was no evidence to support the use of 20m," the consultation reported, pointing out "that other government policies use 50m as a measure of mobility". In a section entitled "What you told us", the DWP notes concern that the plan "could increase isolation and reduce independence, have significant financial impact, and cause deterioration in their physical and mental health". Respondents warned that the 20m criteria would mean some disabled people needing support from other public services, increasing the cost for the government. "The most common suggestion made by respondents", the DWP reports, "was to extend the qualifying distance for the enhanced rate from 20m to a longer distance". Nowhere in the government's response to the consultation is there evidence that anyone thought the 20m criteria was the right policy. "Having considered all these factors", the DWP response concludes, "the government believes that the use of 20m is the best way of identifying those whose physical mobility is most limited". It is, of course, the democratic right of ministers to consult and to listen and then ignore. The arguments put forward by the DWP may be compelling. But it does lead some to ask whether the consultation really had much value. A similar question might be posed following the government's response on Tuesday to consultations on two proposals concerning immigrants. The Home Office published the results of the public consultation on plans for a levy on temporary non-EEA migrants as a contribution towards the costs of possible NHS care while in the UK. It is a move that ministers claim enjoys considerable public support, but the consultation came back with a rather different view. On the principle of a levy, "34% felt that temporary migrants should make a direct contribution to the costs of their healthcare. Sixty-two per cent disagreed," it found. The Home Office notes differences depending upon the "type of respondent". Among the general public, 65% were against the plan. Among organisations that responded, 77% were opposed. Health-sector respondents, however, were in favour - 66% felt temporary migrants should contribute to the cost of their healthcare. It is the view of 235 health sector respondents, representing around 12% of the total, that appears to have swayed ministers most. "We have considered all responses to these questions carefully but remain convinced that only permanent migrants should be automatically eligible for free NHS care." Consultations are not referendums. In a way, it seems odd the Home Office should go to such trouble to quantify the proportions for and against the policy since the exercise is not designed as an X-factor style public vote. But having conducted a public consultation and expressing gratitude to all those "who have taken the time to respond and to those who have contributed their experience and insight to what is a complex issue", one is left wondering what the point was. The government response to a separate consultation, also published on Tuesday, invites the same question. This time the proposal under scrutiny was the introduction of a legal obligation on landlords to check the immigration status of tenants. "While between one-third and two-fifths of respondents supported the proposal," the Home Office response states, "slightly more than half of all respondents disagreed." The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors considered it "inappropriate to use private landlords and lettings agents to help deliver the government's immigration policy". The majority of landlord representative organisations were opposed. "The most widely expressed concern by third sector organisations," the Home Office reveals, "was the potential to impact on vulnerable people, such as those who were homeless, those with learning difficulties and those fleeing domestic abuse". The response? "The government has carefully considered the responses to the consultation and remains convinced of an urgent need for action to deter illegal migration and to safeguard the legitimate housing market." The consultation may lead to ministers including an amendment designed to counter discrimination against foreign national tenants. But on the broad proposal, it seems the exercise has not shifted government thinking one jot. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), "public consultation is one of the key regulatory tools employed to improve transparency, efficiency and effectiveness of regulation". But there has long been scepticism as to whether such exercises are anything more than cosmetic. The public consultation is an opportunity for ministers to test their ideas with experts, those directly affected and voters more generally. Community participation on proposed legislation is seen as a key component of "citizen power". But formal public consultation exercises very rarely result in a government re-think - even if they reveal profound concern. That is not the point of them, and we should not pretend otherwise. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Green taxes</title>
      <description>What are they and how do they affect our bills?</description>

      <body>The past few months have been dominated by a debate over energy prices, with all the political parties coming up with ideas to try to bring them down. The prime minister has announced a review into how the government's climate change policies - so-called green levies or taxes - affect bills and whether they are delivering value for money. But what exactly are these green taxes and how do they affect our bills? UK household dual fuel - electricity and gas - energy bills in 2013 are estimated to be about £1,267, based on average levels of energy consumption. What is that made up of? The chart below shows what the Department of Energy and Climate Change says makes up (in % terms) the average household energy bill. So green energy measures make up 9% of that cost, or £112. The average price of gas and electricity paid by UK households has risen by about 18% and 9% in real terms since 2010 and by about 41% and 20% in real terms since 2007. The chart below shows all of the climate change policies that in some way increase energy bills. So people talk about green levies, but there are in fact lots of different things introduced over the past decade and a half. Some cost people money, some save people money and some do both for different groups of people. It wouldn't therefore be easy to repeal all of them at all (many, like the Green Deal are halfway through their operation and would presumably cost more to get rid of it in the short term than it would to keep longer term). Well, the government says that by 2020 the cumulative impact of their measures will save the average household some 11%. The graph below shows all of the policies and how much they will add or take away from a household bill. So with all those things taken together the Department for Energy and Climate Change say that this is what their effect will be on household bills: So far so good, the policies are saving households' money. But if we look at the effect the policy has on retail prices (rather than bills) - how much each household pays for every unit of energy it consumes - we have a very different picture. Impact of levies on Retail Prices (% change from baseline) On that picture households will be paying 41% more for their electricity bills as a result of green policies than the retail price is expected to be. How is that circle squared? Well, it comes down to government's projections that: So although the retail price will be higher as a result of green measures we'll also use less energy thanks to them. Moreover even if we take the initial figure of 11%, nearly half of that actually comes from changes to boiler regulations all the way back in 2002. If those are removed, then the other measures in place save much less - only about 6%. So if the government has got it sums wrong on how much energy insulation will save, householders could find themselves with a rather big headache in the years to come. The impact of green measures is more considerable on business than for householders. Businesses that are medium-sized users of energy currently face energy (gas plus electricity) costs that are on average between 15% and 21% higher as a result of policies. By 2020 the impact is estimated to be between 23% and 26%. Policies are estimated to be adding between 1% and 14% to energy bills for high-energy users in 2013 and between 6% and 37% in 2020. The range depends on their electricity/gas mix. The government has put several measures in place to compensate the most intensive users so as to try to prevent them from becoming uncompetitive in world markets. </body>

      <body>In the end pragmatism out-pointed outrage. France and Germany have opted to talk with the Americans rather than preside over a rupture in transatlantic relations. That should not disguise a very real sense of betrayal in parts of Europe. Chancellor Angela Merkel was clearly not placated by her phone call with President Obama. His words had been chosen too carefully and it is widely believed in Germany that one of the chancellor's phones had been monitored in the past. "Words will not be sufficient," she said, "true change is necessary". So Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande met at the summit in Brussels and drew up a plan. They are looking to establish a common framework with the United States over intelligence-gathering by the end of the year. They want a new set of rules with a "no spying pact" at the core. This would mirror a similar arrangement the US has had with Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand since just after the World War II. It is unclear, however, where lines would be drawn and how enforceable any pact would be. President Hollande was clear that this was not about weakening ties with America. "What is at stake," he said, "is preserving our relationship with the US. That should not be changed by what happened, but trust has to be restored." There is an underlying reality here: Both Germany and France's intelligence services co-operate with the US closely in monitoring countries like Russia, China and Iran, and neither President Hollande nor Chancellor Merkel wants to change that. The German chancellor was dismissive of suggestions that talks about a free trade deal be postponed until trust between Europe and the US had been restored. She was not prepared to delay a negotiation which promises such rich dividends. Angela Merkel was asked whether she could trust the British and its intelligence agency GCHQ. She sidestepped those questions and spoke about allies serving together in conflict without needing to worry about surveillance. She was also asked whether David Cameron had given assurances that the UK would not spy on its European partners. She implied further discussions were needed, with a view to placing the activities of the intelligence services on a firmer basis. In the end the summit agreed that "intelligence gathering is a vital element in the fight against terrorism". But there was a warning that "a lack of trust could prejudice the necessary co-operation in the field of intelligence-gathering". Spying by its very nature works in the shadows and working out an agreement between Europe and the US will be difficult. In the meantime the reputation of the US in Europe has been damaged by these revelations. </body>
