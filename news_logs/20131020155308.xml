      <body>At least 30 people have been killed by a suicide truck bombing on the edge of the central Syrian city of Hama. State news agency Sana said Syrian rebels had driven a truck laden with over a tonne of explosives into a government checkpoint on a busy road. The explosion appears to have set ablaze a nearby petrol tanker, increasing the damage and casualties. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front carried out the attack. "A man detonated a truck laden with explosives at a checkpoint near an agricultural vehicles company on the road linking Hama to Salamiya," the Observatory said. It said the attack had targeted government soldiers, but that most of the dead were civilians. Pictures on Syria TV showed firemen battling to contain fires as black smoke rose from charred trucks and cars. A man who received leg injuries in the blast told Syrian state TV: "I was heading to a school in Salamiya and the blast started. "These innocent people don't deserve this. The scene is inhumane. These terrorists shouldn't be in this country." Hama saw some of the largest demonstrations against the rule of President Bashar al-Assad in the first months after the Syrian uprising began in March 2011. But in late summer 2011, security forces stormed the city and have maintained control ever since. Hama occupies a significant place in the history of modern Syria. In 1982, then-President Hafez al-Assad, father of Bashar, sent in troops to quell an uprising by the Sunni opposition Muslim Brotherhood. Tens of thousands were killed and the town flattened. Meanwhile, the head of the Arab League has said that a long-awaited conference on Syria will begin on 23 November, although this falls short of a formal announcement. Nabil el-Arabi was speaking after meeting the international envoy on Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, who is on a tour of the Middle East to prepare for the conference. Mr Brahimi did not himself publicly set a date, saying he would do so after his tour. Mr el-Arabi conceded that there were still many obstacles ahead. Western and Arab government officials will meet Syrian opposition leaders on Tuesday to try to persuade them to attend. </body>

      <title>JP Morgan 'faces record $13bn fine'</title>
      <description>US banking giant JP Morgan is set for a record $13bn (£8bn) fine to settle investigations into its mortgage-backed securities, US media reports say.</description>

      <body>US banking giant JP Morgan is set for a record $13bn (£8bn) fine to settle investigations into its mortgage-backed securities, US media reports have said. A tentative deal is believed to have been reached in talks with senior US Justice Department officials. The fine relates to the sale of securities based on home loans, which led to the near-collapse of the banking system in 2007. If confirmed, it would be the biggest settlement ever paid by an US company. Last month, JP Morgan was fined almost $1bn in the "London Whale" scandal, which arose from huge disastrous bets on the financial markets placed by former bank employee Bruno Iksil. The tentative deal to pay the $13bn fine to the Justice Department was reached during the talks on Friday, between JP Morgan lawyers with US Attorney General Eric Holder and his deputy Tony West, the Wall Street Journal said, citing officials familiar with the decision. The New York Times also reported that the investment bank was nearing the agreement. Neither the Justice Department nor the bank was available for comment. But the reports said that while the fine would settle all civil claims, the US bank would still face possible federal criminal charges being pursued in California or individual criminal claims. The $13bn sum is said to include $9bn in fines and a further $4bn in relief for struggling homeowners. In the run-up to the financial crisis, sophisticated financial products known as mortgage-backed securities were created by many investment banks. These special bonds contained a mix of investments but at their heart were supposed to be risk-free home loans, the BBC's business correspondent Joe Lynam reports. When the housing bubble burst, the value of these assets fell sharply and the credit markets seized up. The balance sheets of many US and European banks, including those in the UK, became toxic and they had to be bailed out by their governments. What JP Morgan is alleged to have done was sell the mortgage-backed assets knowing full well that many of the home loans were in fact very risky. Some of the problems relate to mortgage bank Washington Mutual and investment bank Bear Stearns, two failing firms that JPMorgan took over in 2008. The mortgage-backed assets played a central role in the near collapse of the banking system when banks realised in 2007 that many of their assets were worth a fraction of their official book value. JP Morgan had initially aimed to persuade Justice Department officials to drop the criminal investigation but the attorney general ruled that out, reports said. The bank is not alone in facing inquiries into past practice. In August, US government officials filed two lawsuits against Bank of America relating to mortgage-backed securities. Bank of America denied civil fraud in failing to disclose risks and misleading investors. JP Morgan has found itself overwhelmed by mounting legal troubles lately. Once the darling of Washington and Wall Street, it reported a rare quarterly earnings loss last week, mostly due to legal costs totalling $9.2bn. The bank lost $380m during the quarter, compared with a profit of $5.7bn in the same period last year. JP Morgan says it has set aside a fund of $23bn to deal with mounting legal costs. </body>

      <title>Australia declares fire emergency</title>
      <description>A state of emergency is declared in New South Wales as Australian firefighters battle bushfires that are expected to worsen in hot and windy weather.</description>

      <body>A state of emergency has been declared in New South Wales as Australian firefighters battle bushfires that have already destroyed more than 200 homes. The announcement comes as conditions look set to deteriorate with soaring temperatures and strong winds expected to fan the flames in the coming days. The Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, has been the worst-hit region with some fires still raging out of control. State officials say they are the most dangerous conditions in 40 years. New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell said the declaration would give emergency services additional powers over the next 30 days. These could include cutting gas and power supplies if needed and ordering mandatory evacuations. "We're planning for the worst but hoping for the best," he said. One man has died - possibly of a heart attack - while trying to protect his home. Hundreds of people have been left homeless by the bushfires. One firefighter, 24-year-old Tim Boxwell, said he had lost his own home in Winmalee, on the eastern edge of the Blue Mountains, to the fire while he was on duty. "I'd been standing watching other people's houses burn and the emotion from that was bad enough. To be hit with your own house being lost was a shock as well," he told BBC's Newshour. Officials have warned that the three main bushfires - two in the Blue Mountains and one near the town of Lithgow - could become one huge fire in the coming days, possibly threatening Sydney. A fire service spokesman said: "We can understand the magnitude of that as it would then creep into the bottom end of Sydney. It's certainly something that we're very concerned about." The foot of the Blue Mountains lies just across the Nepean River from the suburbs of Sydney. Some embers jumped its banks last Thursday, starting a fire at Castlereagh near Penrith. After several cooler days, forecasters are predicting the return of unseasonably hot weather - with temperatures reaching 30C (86F) and higher. The heat wave would probably peak on Wednesday, warned Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons, but there would be little relief in the intervening period. "We've got what would be unparalleled in terms of risk and exposure to the Blue Mountains throughout this week. If you are to draw a parallel, and it's always dangerous to draw a parallel, at best you'd be going back to time periods in the late 60s. "The reality is, however, these conditions that we're looking at are a whole new ball game and in a league of their own," the commissioner said. Mr O'Farrell said crews had carried out controlled burn operations overnight to strengthen buffer zones around the major fires. An emergency warning was issued for the Blue Mountains village of Bell on Sunday morning. Residents were urged to evacuate or to take shelter "in a solid structure when the fire front arrives". Villagers in Mount Wilson and Mount Irvine, meanwhile, were ordered to stay in their homes after fire cut off access roads. Residents of nearby Bilpin were warned that if they did not evacuate, they could be isolated without power for several days. Assistant police commissioner Alan Clarke said mandatory evacuation orders would be enforced in some areas, describing the risk as "far more extreme" than in past fires. "At the end of the day we hope we have buildings standing, but if we don't have buildings standing we don't want bodies in them," he said. More than 37,000 hectares (91,400 acres) have already been ravaged by fire in the state in the past several days. Officials say that 15 blazes remain out of control. Smoke and ash from the bushfires have blanketed the Sydney skyline. Australia's military is currently investigating whether a training exercise using explosives may have started one of the fires. The exercise took place at a base near the town of Lithgow in the Blue Mountains region on Wednesday. In the past, many such fires have turned out to have been started deliberately, and police say they are monitoring dozens of "firebugs" - people with a history of committing arson, the BBC's Jon Donnison reports from Sydney. Our correspondent says the blazes have come unusually early in the season and follow Australia's hottest year on record.

      <body>Thousands of people have taken to the streets of Hong Kong to protest against what they see as a lack of government transparency and accountability. Police put the turnout at 20,000, while organisers said 120,000 were there. The controversy was sparked last week when the government declined to grant a free-to-air licence to Hong Kong Television Network. Critics of the government have urged officials to give a clear account of why the licence was refused. Organiser Kristine Chan, from Hong Kong Free TV Action, told the Associated Press: "People are feeling very angry about this event, that the government is not really giving us many choices of free TV and trying to monopolise the industry by limiting the licences." Lawrence Lau, a Hong Kong citizen taking part in the protest, said: "They don't have the resolve to make a fair decision. They always suppress Hong Kong people and try to favour the government in Beijing." A spokesman for the city's Commerce Bureau has said the content of discussions made during meetings of the Executive Council were, as a rule, not made public. </body>

      <body>Five suicide bombers have attacked government buildings in Iraq's western Anbar province killing two policemen and three officials, police say. At least 20 people were injured. No group has said it carried out the attack but police told the BBC they suspect Sunni Muslim insurgents. Iraq has experienced a surge in violence in recent months. In another incident, police said a suicide bomber killed six people in the city of Samarra, north of Baghdad. The bomber targeted the house of a senior policeman but he is believed to have survived the attack. Those killed are said to be members of his family. In Anbar province, police said two bombers on foot and another driving a vehicle rigged with explosives attacked the police headquarters in the town of Rawa. The other suicide bombers struck an army checkpoint at the town's entrance and the local administrative headquarters where officials were meeting. It was the second attack in less than a month to hit Rawa, about 75km (45 miles) from the Syrian border. Analysts say more than 6,000 people have been killed in acts of violence in Iraq this year. Correspondents say the failure of Iraq's Shia-led government to address the grievances of Iraq's Sunni Arab minority has driven the surge in unrest. Many Sunnis complain of being excluded from government jobs and senior posts and of abuses by security forces. </body>

      <body>A counter-piracy task force commanded by a Royal Navy officer has caught a group of Somalis believed responsible for two attacks in the Indian Ocean. Pirates had exchanged gunfire with a super tanker on Friday 11 October before attacking a Spanish fishing vessel three days later. Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) traced the pirates' skiffs from Britain's Royal Fleet Auxiliary Fort Victoria. Nine men were caught and forces later destroyed two boats and equipment. Commodore Jeremy Blunden, Royal Navy, Commander of CTF-151, said: "This is an excellent result. "My multinational counter piracy forces swiftly located and dealt with this Somali pirate group, sending a clear message that piracy no longer pays." Combined Task Force (CTF) 151, as the group is known, embarked on board RFA Fort Victoria with support from Australian guided-missile frigate HMAS Melbourne and South Korean destroyer ROKS Wang Geon. The European Union flagship Dutch HNLMS Johan de Witt - flagship of the EU naval force in the area - and maritime patrol aircraft from Luxembourg were also part of the mission. After tracing the pirates an HMAS Melbourne Seahawk guided the warship to their precise location, 500 nautical miles off the Somali coast, before a boarding team made the final approach to search the skiffs. Commander Brian Schlegel, Royal Australian Navy, commanded HMAS Melbourne during the operation. He said: "It is clear that there are still pirates out there determined to generate income from taking merchant ships hostage. "Mariners have been served a timely reminder of the perils of transiting the Somali coastline." CMF is a multinational naval partnership with 29 nation members. Its aim is to promotes security, stability and prosperity across 2.5 million square miles of international waters. </body>

      <title>US killers freed by mistake captured</title>
      <description>Two convicted murderers who used forged documents to trick their way out of prison in Florida have been recaptured, US officials say.</description>

      <body>Two convicted murderers who used forged documents to trick their way out of prison in Florida have been recaptured, US officials say. Joseph Jenkins and Charles Walker, both 34, were seized without incident at a motel in Panama City, Florida. The men, who were serving life sentences, had been freed from separate jails after officials were fooled by fake papers reducing their terms. The prison authorities have pledged to tighten up their early-release policy. The two convicts were arrested at the Coconut Grove Motor Inn on Saturday evening, the authorities said. They were detained hours after relatives held a news conference urging them to turn themselves in. Jenkins had walked out on 27 September and registered as felon three days later at a jail in Orange County, Florida, about 300 miles (480km) from the prison where he was serving his sentence. Walker had been set free on 8 October from the same prison and registered on 11 October. The falsified documents were not identified until several weeks after the first convict's release. It is not clear who provided the bogus release documents. The two prisoners had apparently signed on to maintain the ruse that they had been released early by a judge. Released felons are required to register as they re-enter the public, otherwise a warrant is issued for their arrest. The registration process includes fingerprinting, images of which are uploaded to Florida police records. Officials also verify that felons do not have any outstanding warrants. Release documents bearing the forged signature of a sitting judge had been processed through standard channels this autumn, officials said. Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry said there were several red flags that should have alerted the court clerk's office or the corrections department: notably, how rare it was for a sentence reduction to come from prosecutors. On Friday, Florida Corrections Secretary Michael Crews said prisons would now verify with judges, not just court clerks, before releasing prisoners early. Authorities have been reviewing other releases based on modified court orders received from Orange County, to ensure no other inmates have been prematurely freed. Jenkins was serving a life sentence for the 1998 fatal shooting of a father of six during a botched robbery. Walker was sentenced to life in prison for the 1999 shooting of a 23-year-old man. Walker said he did not mean to kill the man but fired three shots in warning because the man had been bullying him. </body>

      <title>Hostages freed in Lebanon swap deal</title>
      <description>Nine Lebanese citizens kidnapped in Syria last year return home to Beirut, after a complex hostage deal sees two Turkish pilots released in Lebanon.</description>

      <body>Nine Lebanese citizens who were kidnapped by rebels in Syria in May 2012 have arrived back in Beirut a day after being released. There were jubilant scenes as they were greeted on the tarmac by family members and Lebanese politicians. Two Turkish pilots who were being held hostage in Lebanon were also freed as part of a complex swap. Murat Akpinar and Murat Agca were seized in Beirut in August in a retaliatory abduction. They were met by their relatives and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan after flying to Istanbul on a Qatari jet late on Saturday. A third part of the hostage negotiations - reportedly mediated by Qatar, Turkey and the Palestinian Authority - involved the release of a number of female prisoners being held by the Syrian government. It is not yet clear whether that has taken place. The Lebanese group, all men, were released by their captors on Friday evening and driven to Istanbul, from where they flew to Beirut. At the airport they were greeted by friends and family, as well as politicians and religious leaders. The men appeared tired but in good health. "A whole year passed and each of us never slept more than two hours a night due to exhaustion and too much thinking about what would or could happen to us," one told the BBC. Others described being kept in dark and windowless rooms and hearing heavy fighting. "Our abductors didn't respect us, they treated us badly," Ali Zogheib was quoted as saying by Lebanese media. "We wished that any of them had any kind of values", another said of his captors. One of the pilgrims thought they had been held close to the Syrian border with Turkey. The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says it is clear that huge effort has gone into producing the complicated deal. Lebanon's security chief Maj Gen Abbas Ibrahim, who co-ordinated the hostage release, said it had been "difficult, without a doubt". "I didn't want anything from this deal, except to see this sight,'' he said, gesturing at the cheering crowds. The nine Lebanese were among 11 people seized while making their way back to Lebanon after a tour of holy sites in Iran. Two of them escaped. They were reportedly being held in northern Syria by fighters from a Sunni-based rebel group opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The rebels insisted their hostages were fighters with the Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah, and were demanding the release of women detainees held by the Syrian regime in exchange. Then in August, Murat Akpinar and Murat Agca were seized from a bus close to Beirut's international airport. A previously unknown group called Zuwwar al-Imam Rida said it had kidnapped them, and that they would be freed if the Lebanese group were set free. It demanded that Turkey used its influence with Syrian rebels to make the swap possible. In response, Turkey advised its citizens in Lebanon to leave if possible. Turkey has consistently backed Syria's Sunni rebels, while much of Lebanon's Shia community supports President Bashar al-Assad. The pilots' abduction sparked protests in Lebanon, and growing concerns that the Syrian civil war was spilling over the border. Earlier this week they appeared in a video broadcast on Lebanese television saying they were both well and wanted to go home. Then, as word came late on Saturday that the Lebanese citizens were back in Beirut, the pilots arrived in Istanbul. They told Turkish media that they had been treated well in captivity. But Mr Akpinar told the Hurriyet newspaper that "first month has been very difficult". "We have been transferred eight times, each time as if it was a new kidnapping." "We chose to have a good understanding with them. And we did, so much that one of our (kidnappers) has even decided to call his new son Murat," Mr Akpinar added. Syrian and Lebanese politics have been deeply intertwined throughout the history of the two states. Syria had a large military presence in Lebanon for 29 years. It finally withdrew its soldiers in 2005, but has maintained a strong influence. The conflict in Syria, now in its third year, has claimed more than 100,000 lives and created more than two million refugees. Our correspondent says that while the war rages on, the hostage exchange creates a small glimmer of hope as efforts intensify to arrange a peace conference in Geneva next month. </body>

      <title>'Secret burial' for Nazi Priebke</title>
      <description>Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke, who died under house arrest in Rome last week, is to be buried in a secret location, his lawyer says.</description>

      <body>Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke, who died under house arrest in Rome last week, is to be buried in a secret location, his lawyer has said. On Wednesday, his coffin was seized by the Italian authorities and taken to a military base near Rome after a funeral was halted amid angry protests. Rome city authorities had banned any burial in the city. Priebke was extradited from Argentina and jailed for life in Italy over the 1944 killing of 335 civilians. "The agreement satisfies the family and ethical and spiritual requirements," said his lawyer, Paolo Giachini, adding that there would be "a small ceremony for relatives" following the funeral. The whereabouts of the burial are unknown but Mr Giachini is reported as saying that "we had contacts to bury the coffin of Priebke both in Italy and in Germany". A cardiologist has offered to have the remains interred in his family's grave near Verona, but the local mayor is said to be against the proposal. The German embassy in Rome has said it had not been contacted by Priebke's lawyer and had no request for a burial, the Italian news agency Ansa quoted embassy sources as saying. Argentina - where Priebke lived for nearly 50 years before being extradited to Italy - refused to fulfil his wish to have his body repatriated for burial beside his wife. Priebke's hometown in Germany also refused to take the body, over fears that any place of burial could become a pilgrimage site for neo-Nazis. He was one of the SS officers overseeing the killing of men and boys at Rome's Ardeatine Caves in March 1944, one of the worst massacres in Italy during World War II. In a reprisal for the killing of 33 German soldiers in Rome by resistance fighters, 335 Italian civilians were shot dead. Though Priebke admitted his role in the massacre, he never expressed any remorse and maintained he was following orders. In a video message recorded before he died - and released posthumously by his lawyer - the former SS officer repeated the defence he had given at his war crimes trial. He said he had received direct orders from Adolf Hitler to carry out the massacre. Priebke was extradited in 1994 after investigative journalists from US television network ABC News tracked him down in Argentina. In 1998, he was sentenced to life in prison. However, he pleaded that he was too old and sick for jail, and was soon allowed to switch to a regime of house arrest. The Vatican issued an unprecedented ban on holding Priebke's funeral in any Catholic church in Rome, but a Catholic splinter group, the Society of St Pius X, tried to hold a ceremony on Tuesday outside the city, in Albano Laziale. </body>

      <body>The authorities in Mexico have said gunmen dressed as clowns have shot dead a former leading member of a once-powerful and violent drug cartel. Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix, 63, was killed in a beach resort in Baja California in north-western Mexico. He and his brothers controlled the drug trade on Mexico's border with the United States in the 1990s. But their Tijuana cartel was gradually weakened by the capture or killing of other leading members. "He was hit by two bullets, one in the chest and one in the head," said Isai Arias, a Baja California state government official. The motive for the attack and the gunmen's disguise were being investigated, he added. The attack took place during a family party at a rented beach house in the tourist resort of Cabo San Lucas. The former cartel leader was arrested in 1993 but released nearly 15 years later after spending time in prison in Mexico and the United States. His brother Eduardo was jailed in August in the US for 15 years after pleading guilty to money laundering. Security experts believe the Tijuana cartel is now run by his sister Enedina and her son Fernando, known as "The Engineer", according to AFP news agency. Most estimates put the number of people killed in Mexican drug-related violence since late 2006 at more than 60,000. </body>

      <body>Voters in Luxembourg have gone to the polls in a snap election sparked by a secret service and corruption scandal. Jean-Claude Juncker's coalition cabinet collapsed in July amid claims he had failed to stop illegal security agency activities, including phone-tapping. He had headed Luxembourg's government as PM since 1995, longer than any other elected leader in Europe. But the centre-left, the Liberals and the Greens are now hoping to win enough seats to form a coalition government. With Mr Juncker's image badly dented, there is the possibility that this time they will win a majority between them, putting together a cabinet that excludes the centre-right, the BBC's Europe correspondent Christian Fraser reports. Polling stations in the Grand Duchy opened at 08:00 (06:00 GMT) and closed at 14:00 (12:00 GMT). Early results are expected later on Sunday. Mr Juncker was head of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers from 2005-13. But the coalition government of Mr Juncker's centre-right Christian Social People's Party and the Socialists unravelled in July. Critics at home have accused him of failing to focus on pressing domestic issues. Earlier this year, the parliament reviewed a report alleging the allegations against the SREL security agency, which Mr Juncker oversees. It included claims of illegal bugging of politicians, the purchase of cars for private use and payments in exchange for access to local officials. Mr Juncker has denied any wrongdoing. </body>

      <body>The funeral of Pakistani singer, Zubeida Khanum, who died aged 78 following a heart attack at her home in Lahore, has taken place in the city. Khanum, who recorded almost 250 songs during her career, was famed for her performances during Lollywood's "golden era" of the 50s and 60s. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif described her as a "national asset". She acted in the film Billoo in 1951 but found fame in 1953 with playback singing, pre-recorded for use in films. She received great recognition from the Pakistani film industry for her playback work in the 1953 film Shehri Babu. During the early years of her career, she also did brief roles in a handful of films including Morni and Patey Khan alongside the late Noor Jehan. President Mamnoon Hussain recalled her services for performing arts in the country and said they were "unforgettable". Born in 1935 in Amritsar, Khanum migrated with her family to Pakistan after the partition. She was the eldest of four children and her talent for singing was spotted at school by her teacher, who put her in touch with Radio Pakistan. Despite her family being against a career in music, Khanum performed her first song in Punjabi. Speaking to the BBC in one of her last interviews, she said: "I always had a passion for singing. I was so happy being in the studio. "They loved my voice". One of her favourite songs was from the hit film Saat Lakh called Aaye Mausam Rangeele. "I loved its music and its lyrics," she added. At the height of her career, Khanum, married renowned cameraman Riyaz Bokhari and left the music industry. She went on to have two daughters and two sons. Khanum spent the last few years of her life using a wheelchair and living with her sons in Lahore. One of her sons is the well-known cameraman Faisal Bokhari. </body>

      <body>Some 6,000 history buffs in period military costume are re-enacting one of Germany's bloodiest battles, the Battle of the Nations. French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte was defeated near Leipzig in October 1813 by forces from Russia, Austria, Prussia and Sweden. Tens of thousands of spectators are attending the reconstruction, described as a "reconciliation". However, Church leaders object to the battle being turned into a game. They see Sunday's event as tantamount to glorifying the carnage of war, the BBC's Damien McGuinness reports. An ecumenical service was held in the town of Roetha on Saturday to mark the 200th anniversary of the event - also known as the Battle of Leipzig. The night before, European Parliament President Martin Schulz gave a speech at a memorial to the battle warning of a resurgence of nationalism. An estimated 600,000 soldiers took part in the series of battles from 16-19 October 1813 and almost 100,000 of them lost their lives. The victory of the allies - including a small British contingent - over Napoleon marked the end of his control of German territory. Organisers say their controversial re-enactment is intended to be peaceful and to bring history alive. Many of the thousands taking part have grown period-style moustaches to match their 19th Century replica uniforms. The role of Napoleon is being played by a 46-year-old Parisian lawyer, Frank Samson, who taught himself the Corsican language in an attempt to give a more authentic performance as the French emperor. Local TV is reporting live from the scene as if the battle is actually being fought today. </body>

      <title>Former US House Speaker Foley dies</title>
      <description>Former Democratic US Speaker of the House of Representatives Tom Foley, credited with reaching across the aisles in a more bipartisan Congress, dies.</description>

      <body>A former US Speaker of the House of Representatives who was credited with reaching across the aisles in a less bitterly divided Congress has died. Tom Foley, 84, died of complications from a stroke on Friday, his wife said. Born and raised in the north-western US state of Washington, the Democrat served in the House for 30 years and was speaker from 1989-1995. "America has lost a legend of the United States Congress," President Barack Obama said in a statement. "Tom's straightforward approach helped him find common ground with members of both parties," Mr Obama said. As speaker, he was an active negotiator in the 1990 budget talks that led to President George HW Bush breaking his pledge to never raise taxes. "Tom never got personal or burned bridges," Mr Bush said on Friday. "We didn't agree on every issue, but on key issues we managed to put the good of the country ahead of politics." Foley also allowed the House to vote on the resolution that approved the 1990 Iraq war, despite his own personal reservations and the objections of many fellow Democrats. "He granted our request for a vote because it was the right thing to do," Bob Michel, the Republican minority leader at the time, said. "He was that kind of leader." But Foley became the first House Speaker to be ousted by voters in his own constituency - as opposed to through a majority change in the chamber or a no-confidence vote from his own party - since the US Civil War. He was defeated by 4,000 votes in November 1994 by Spokane lawyer George Nethercutt, a Republican who supported term limits, which Foley had long fought. That was the year of the so-called Republican revolution led by Newt Gingrich, who became House Speaker in 1995. On Friday, the current House Speaker, John Boehner, called Foley "a model for any speaker or representative". "Tom Foley endeared himself not only to the wheat farmers back home but also colleagues on both sides of the aisle," Mr Boehner said. After leaving the House, Foley served as US ambassador to Japan for four years. </body>

      <body>A trainee Catholic nun has appeared in court charged with killing her newborn child at a convent in Washington DC. Sosefina Amoa was ordered to be held without bail, according to the US Attorney's office. The 26-year-old is accused of first-degree murder in the smothering death of her infant son. She told police she had not informed the convent of her past sexual activity and feared the nuns would hear the boy's cries. Ms Amoa was arrested on Wednesday and arraigned in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia on Friday, according to US Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia spokesman Bill Miller. She will next appear in court on 23 October, Mr Miller added. Ms Amoa arrived from Samoa on 5 October and sought to be admitted to the Catholic order. Her immigration status is not clear. According to court documents, Ms Amoa gave birth on 10 October in a room at the Little Sisters of the Poor elderly care facility. She told investigators she feared the nuns would discover the birth. She said she smothered the infant, named Joseph, with a wool garment, according to the authorities. A day later, she informed a nun at the convent of the child. The unnamed nun allegedly found the child cold and not breathing, and transported the body in a luggage bag to a local hospital along with Ms Amoa, court documents state. "We all feel that this is a tragic situation," Sister Constance Veit, communications director of Little Sisters of the Poor, told the Associated Press news agency. </body>

      <body>A commuter train in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, has crashed at the end of the line, leaving at least 80 people injured. The train failed to stop as it arrived at Once station, crashing through the buffers and ending up wedged between the floor and ceiling of the platform. The accident happened at the same station where 51 people were killed in a similar crash last year. The cause of the accident remains unclear. Saturday's crash happened shortly after 07:00 local time (10:00 GMT). The line from Moreno 40km (25 miles) west of Buenos Aires to Once station, operated by the Sarmiento train company, is normally a busy commuter line during the week, and its trains are usually packed with passengers. Security Secretary Sergio Berni said some of those injured on Saturday had been waiting on the platform and were hurt by flying glass as the train's windows shattered. Jorge Ramirez, a chef who got on the train nine stations before the end of the line, told the AP news agency the accident was "a tragedy". "I saw people hurt, shouting, others thrown on the floor. The people in the first wagon ended up piled on top of each other," he said. After the 2012 crash, the authorities revoked a local company's right to operate trains on the line and pledged to make new investments in safety. But commuters complain of frequent delays and bad service, and it is not uncommon to see travellers crammed into trains on their way to work, says the BBC's Ignacio de los Reyes in Buenos Aires. </body>

      <title>Fire burns tonnes of sugar in Brazil</title>
      <description>A fire in Brazil's largest port burns some 180,000 tonnes of raw sugar and pushes world prices to a one-year high.</description>

      <body>A fire in Brazil's largest port has burnt some 180,000 tonnes of raw sugar, damaging six warehouses and pushing international prices to a one-year high. The authorities in the port of Santos said it took six hours to bring the fire under control. The cause of the blaze is still being investigated. Brazil is the world's main sugar exporter, accounting for nearly half of international sales. The terminal affected by the fire belongs to Brazilian sugar giant Copersucar. Four other sugar terminals are operating normally, port authorities said. Analysts say Brazil has enough port capacity to carry on with its usual export levels. "International markets react because they know there will be a temporary drop. But other terminals will certainly make up for the accident," sugar market analyst Plinio Nastari told Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper. Sugar prices in New York future markets went up by 6% when news of the fire broke, dropping later in the day. Port authorities said that the fire began at around 06:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on a conveyor belt taking raw sugar into one of the warehouses. They say this is the biggest fire in the history of the port of Santos, which exported 12.8 million tonnes of sugar in the first eight months of the year. The port is located some 80km (50 miles) from Sao Paulo. It was the gateway for much of Brazil's coffee exports in the 19th and 20th century and also the main point of entry for millions of European immigrants who arrived in Brazil until the 1950s. </body>

      <body>Tunisian security forces have killed at least nine suspected Islamist militants who are blamed for a deadly attack on a police patrol, officials say. They say at least three other suspects were arrested in the operation in the Mount Taouyer area, about 70km (44 miles) west of the capital, Tunis. Two policemen died when they were attacked in the area on Thursday. Interior Ministry spokesman Mohamed Ali Aroui said the militants belonged to the Salafist Ansar al-Sharia group. The group has been declared a terrorist organisation by the government and the interior ministry spokesman told reporters on Saturday that the three-day operation "has been a success". About two tonnes of materials used to make explosives were also seized. The killing of the two police officers led to an angry response from security forces when Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki, Prime Minister Ali Larayedh and other senior officials attended a memorial service for the men on Friday. The leaders were forced to leave the ceremony because of the hostility. Ansar al-Sharia has been blamed for the murders of two secular opposition politicians earlier this year. Their deaths also triggered mass protests against Tunisia's Islamist-led government. Several other militant groups - including al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb - also operate in the region. But the latest clashes were significantly closer to the capital than previous fighting with suspected Islamists. Since the popular revolt that sparked the "Arab Spring" in 2011, Tunisia has seen a rise in attacks by militants. A coalition led by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party was elected in 2011. But some government critics accuse it of being soft on hardline Islamist forces - charges it strongly denies. </body>

      <title>Welby makes detour to Kenya</title>
      <description>The Archbishop of Canterbury is meeting fellow archbishops from the conservative Gafcon movement in Kenya after making a detour on his way from London to Iceland.</description>

      <body>The Archbishop of Canterbury has made a detour of more than 8,000 miles to visit Kenya - on his way to Iceland. Archbishop Justin Welby, who arrived on Saturday night, gave sermons at All Saints Cathedral on Sunday morning. He made the "last-minute" 24-hour trip to offer condolences after the Westgate centre attack, Lambeth Palace said. He is also meeting conservative Church leaders who are in Nairobi for this week's conference of the breakaway world Anglican group, Gafcon. Archbishop Welby was due to fly to Iceland - via London's Heathrow Airport - on Sunday night. In Iceland, he will attend a primates' meeting of the Porvoo Communion, formed of churches mainly in northern Europe. At least 67 people died when suspected al-Shabab militants stormed the Westgate shopping centre, in Nairobi, on 21 September. The attack sparked a four-day siege in which large parts of the shopping centre were destroyed. "The aim of the visit is to offer condolences and encouragement to the people of Kenya and those affected by the Westgate attack and to offer support to bishops in Kenya", a spokeswoman for Lambeth Palace said. The Archbishop of Canterbury stayed overnight at the home of the Archbishop of Kenya Eliud Wabukala - who is also the current chairman of Gafcon - the Global Anglican Future Conference. Archbishop Welby delivered sermons at 09:30 and 11:00 before having lunch with the Archbishop of Kenya and five Kenyan bishops. Gafcon 2013 - the second such conference - will run from Monday to Saturday. The original conference - held in Jerusalem in June 2008 - was organised in response to the appointment of actively gay men and women as bishops, especially in the US. Through the Gafcon movement, conservative Anglican provinces - mostly in parts of Africa but some in South and North America, Asia and the Middle East- have begun to function independently of the official Anglican Communion. Gafcon has condemned those who preach a "false gospel" which "claims God's blessing for same-sex unions over against the biblical teaching on holy matrimony". Lambeth Palace said the Archbishop of Canterbury was unable to accept an invitation to attend Gafcon 2013 because of his longstanding trip to Iceland and because he would be baptising Prince George at St James's Palace on Wednesday. Gafcon leaders have said the archbishop's predecessor, Dr Rowan Williams, was not forthright enough in condemning the appointment of gay bishops. The Archbishop of Kenya told BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme that Archbishop Welby was "new to us and to the communion". "I think he is interested in connecting with the activities of the communion and the Gafcon movement is part of those very significant activities that he will not miss," he added. "I think it's significant that he has recognised that fact," he added. "We hope things may not work the way they worked last time. "He has been to various parts in in Africa. He has been to Kenya before. "I think he has the experience to learn and also to be able to connect." In March, Archbishop Welby acknowledged that some gay couples have loving, stable and monogamous relationships of "stunning" quality. He told BBC News he had "particular friends where I recognise that and am deeply challenged by it". But he said he still supported the Church of England's formal opposition to active homosexuality. </body>

      <body>Opposition supporters in the Maldives have staged protests after police intervened to stop the presidential election from taking place. Police prevented ballot papers from being sent out on Saturday, saying two of the three candidates had failed to approve the registry of voters. The elections commission has accused the police of exceeding their mandate The Maldives has been in turmoil since ex-President Mohamed Nasheed was ousted in disputed circumstances in 2012. The first round of the election, held earlier this month, was won by Mr Nasheed, the Maldives' first democratically elected president. But that result was annulled and the second round of voting postponed amid allegations of electoral fraud, although international monitors said the process had been free and fair. Mr Nasheed has been leading the peaceful protests in the capital, Male. His supporters blocked a main road, drinking tea and eating snacks in a display of civil disobedience. Protesters spread out banners calling for the election to take place immediately and asking, "where is my vote". The current president, Mohamed Waheed Hassan - who had already pulled out of the leadership race after performing badly in the annulled first round - has proposed that the re-run be held on 26 October. "I hope that over that week, any outstanding problems will be ironed out," he told the Associated Press, saying he wanted to ensure a new president was installed before the end of his term on 11 November. The two remaining presidential candidates - Gasim Ibrahim and Abdulla Yameen - have been fighting for the re-run not to take place. Late on Friday, they sought an injunction against the election at the Supreme Court. They complained that they had not had time to endorse the registry of voters - a newly introduced requirement. The court did not issue an injunction but nor did it give a clear instruction for the election to go ahead. On Saturday, electoral commission head Fuwad Thowfeek said police had entered his offices and were stopping officials distributing election materials. Police spokesman Abdulla Nawaz said the election was stopped because the commission did not comply with a court order to have the voters' list endorsed by all candidates. But Mr Thowfeek accused them of exceeding their mandate. "We are very much concerned about what is going on in this country. The Supreme Court decision does not ask police officers to look into the voters' list and check what is there," he told reporters. The cancellation caused alarm among the country's international partners. India's foreign ministry said it was "seriously concerned at attempts to stall the democratic process", while a US embassy official in Sri Lanka said the delay "represents a real threat to democracy in Maldives". UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said he was "deeply dismayed" and called for the democratic process in the Maldives to be allowed to proceed. Commonwealth observers in the country also issued an angry statement denying suggestions by the police that they had sought Commonwealth advice before stopping the election. </body>

      <body>American jazz star Patti Austin has cancelled a concert in Beijing after suffering "a severe asthma attack". A statement on the singer's website said Ms Austin was unable to perform at Forbidden City Concert Hall on Friday night "due to health problems". While the cause of her illness has not been confirmed, it comes at a time of growing concern over air pollution levels in the Chinese capital. The city has recently announced measures to combat worsening pollution. They include taking half of the city's four million private cars off the roads on days when there are serious levels of pollution. The system will be based on a vehicle's licence plate - odd numbers will be allowed on the roads one day, even numbers the next. A statement on Patti Austin's website said: "She was taken in an emergency to the Peking Union Medical College Hospital this morning where she has been treated for a severe asthma attack in combination with respiratory infection. "Ms Austin is currently resting in her hotel. Her current breathing condition does not physically enable her to perform tonight. "Ms Austin is extremely disappointed about this situation since she was very much looking forward to performing." The new anti-pollution system will give out four different degrees of air pollution warning - blue, yellow, amber and red. On days when an amber warning is given, factories will stop production and work will be halted on construction and building sites. Restaurants which offer an open-air barbecues will be ordered to close temporarily, and fireworks will be banned throughout the city. When a red warning is issued, the new car restriction measure will be implemented. Schools and kindergartens will also be closed. The measure to restrict the number of private cars from using the road is proving to be controversial. Critics have aired their concern that those who can afford to buy two or more cars will able to drive any day when the restriction is in force. Beijing has almost 21 million permanent residents, according to official estimates. </body>

      <body>Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) has agreed a series of economic demands ahead of coalition talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel next week. SDP leaders promised the 200 members meeting on Sunday that they would win concessions from Mrs Merkel's centre-right bloc including a minimum wage. Mrs Merkel's alliance won recent elections but fell short of a majority. In 2005-2009 the SPD formed a "grand" coalition with Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and its allies the CSU. But correspondents say the experience has made them wary about working with the CDU/CSU again. A majority of the 200 members meeting on Sunday backed a statement agreeing to the start of formal talks. An internal SPD document seen by Reuters before the meeting said the party would insist that 10 demands were non-negotiable. They include a minimum wage of 8.50 euros (£7) per hour, equal pay for men and women, greater investment in infrastructure and education, and a common strategy to boost eurozone growth and employment. The party would also demand equal pensions for the elderly in the former West and East Germany and measures to make it easier to combine work with family life, Reuters reported. No mention was made of tax increases for the wealthiest, which the SPD had campaigned on during September's election. Allies of Chancellor Merkel have said they could live with a minimum wage but not with the higher taxes. The SDP also wants to move away from tough austerity measures and focus more on growth and job creation. It is understood that talks on coalition policies and cabinet posts could begin as early as next Wednesday and could last more than a month. The BBC's Stephen Evans in Berlin says it will be interesting to see if the SPD pushes for the post of finance minister in any new government, as the post is currently filled by the CDU's Wolfgang Schaeuble, seen as the driver of Germany's tough economic policy. Mrs Merkel's previous coalition ally, the Free Democrats, failed to win any seats in September leaving Mrs Merkel seeking a new partner. Her options narrowed last week when the Greens announced that talks with the CDU/CSU had failed. At the polls on 22 September, the CDU/CSU took about 41.5% of the vote, the SPD won 26%, the former communist Left Party 8.6% and the Greens 8.4%. </body>

      <body>At least 10 people have been killed after a small tourist plane crashed near the city of Namur in south-east Belgium. It was carrying a group of skydivers and crashed shortly after take-off, killing all those on board, the local mayor has told the AFP news agency. The plane is thought to have taken off from the Temploux aerodrome and crashed around 10 minutes later in a field. Its wing appeared to have suffered some damage, Belgian media report. The small plane came down near the village of Marchovelette, 10km (six miles) from Namur. The passengers did not have time to jump out, the mayor of the nearby town of Fernelmont told AFP. Pictures show black smoke billowing from a burnt-out fuselage. "I just saw a plane lose its right wing in mid-flight and crash. I heard a massive 'bang' towards the south of Marchovelette," one witness told Belgian television. "I didn't see anyone escape with a parachute," the witness added. </body>

      <body>A car bomb has exploded outside a military intelligence building in the Egyptian city of Ismailiya, north-east of Cairo. The Egyptian army said six soldiers were injured in the blast, which destroyed part of the building's wall and set fire to several cars. A second car bomb was found in the area, but experts managed to defuse it, AFP quoted officials as saying. Witnesses said they had heard loud gunfire around the time of the blast. Ismailiya and nearby areas have seen regular attacks on the police and military personnel by Islamist militants. The military has been carrying out a wide-ranging operation against militants in the Sinai Peninsula. Police and army troops have cordoned the area for security checking. </body>

      <title>UN 'not notified' of Saudi snub</title>
      <description>UN chief Ban Ki-moon says he has received no official notification from Saudi Arabia that it will turn down a seat on the UN Security Council.</description>

      <body>UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says he has received no notification from Saudi Arabia that it will turn down a seat on the UN Security Council. Earlier the Saudi foreign ministry said it had turned down the non-permanent seat, accusing the world body of "double standards". The ministry said the UN needs to be reformed first. It said the Security Council had failed in its duties towards Syria as well as in other world conflicts. Mr Ban refused to say whether he would be speaking to the Saudi king about the matter. "I understand that some member states, particularly some concerned group of member states, are discussing [this] among themselves," Mr Ban said. The reaction among diplomats to this unprecedented decision has been one of shock and confusion, the BBC's Nada Tawfik reports from the UN. France's UN ambassador Gerard Araud said: "We think that Saudi Arabia would have brought a very positive contribution to the Security Council, but we do also understand the frustration of Saudi Arabia." "The fact is that the Security Council has been unable to act now for more than two years," Mr Araud said, according to AFP. However, Russia's foreign ministry called the move bewildering, and said Saudi Arabia's criticism of the UN Security Council about its actions over Syria "is particularly strange". Saudi Arabia has previously expressed frustration at what it sees as an international failure to act on Syria, where it staunchly backs the rebels. The announcement came hours after Saudi Arabia was elected for the first time to one of the 10 rotating seats on the Security Council. The non-permanent members sit on the council for two years, along with the five permanent members - the US, the UK, France, China and Russia. As well as accusing the council of "double-standards" and demanding reform, the Saudi foreign ministry pointed to its failure "to find a solution to the Palestinian cause for 65 years", which had led to "numerous wars that have threatened world peace". It also criticised the UN's "failure" to rid the Middle East region of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons. And it accused the UN of allowing the Syrian government "to kill its own people with chemical weapons... without confronting it or imposing any deterrent sanctions". The UN Security Council last month finally broke a two-and-a-half year deadlock on how to deal with conflict in Syria after voting unanimously to adopt a binding resolution on ridding the country of chemical weapons. Saudi observers say Riyadh would have been working for years to gain a place on the UN Security Council, so such a decision would have to have been made at the very top of the kingdom's leadership. </body>

      <title>Schools rift 'not a crisis' - Clegg</title>
      <description>The deputy prime minister distances the Liberal Democrats from the government's free schools policy, but insists there is no "great coalition crisis" over the issue.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24599458</url>

      <body>Nick Clegg has denied there is a "great coalition crisis", ahead of a speech in which he will distance the Liberal Democrats from part of the government's policy on free schools. The deputy prime minister will argue free schools must follow the national curriculum and should not allow unqualified people to teach. But he told Sky News this was part of a "grown-up" debate between the parties. Downing Street had expressed surprise at Mr Clegg's comments. Free schools, set up by parents and other groups, are state-funded but operate outside local authority control. They were established under a policy pioneered by Education Secretary Michael Gove and since September 2011 more than 170 have been opened across England. Currently free schools have discretion over what to teach, but in his speech to a school in north London on Thursday, Mr Clegg will ask: "What's the point of having a national curriculum if only a few schools have to teach it?" His next party manifesto will also say all schools should adhere to new standards on meals and demand that teachers are either qualified or near qualification. Last week, the head teacher of a primary free school in London, who was still studying for her postgraduate certificate in education, stood down following criticism from Labour councillors. There was also controversy when the Al-Madinah free school in Derby was classed as inadequate by education inspectors. In his speech to a London school this week, Mr Clegg will say: "I'm proud of our work over the last three years to increase school autonomy, which, in government with the Conservatives, has been through the academies programme." But he will go on to question "aspects of schools policy currently affected by the priorities of the Conservative Party which I would not want to see continue". Mr Clegg will add: "Whilst I want to give schools the space to innovate, I also believe every parent needs reassurance that the school their child attends, whatever its title or structure, meets certain core standards of teaching and care. A parental guarantee, if you like." Appearing on Sky News, he said he was a supporter of free schools, but his concern was about maintaining standards. He said: "Most head teachers and parents would expect that the teachers who teach their children have the proper qualifications." Asked whether his comments were a signal that the Lib Dems were moving closer to Labour's policy, with a view to possible coalition-forming after the next general election, Mr Clegg said this was "complete and utter nonsense". He added that "tensions" were part of being in coalition and said: "It's not a political crisis when some of those differences are articulated in public." A Department for Education spokesman said free schools were "raising standards and giving parents more choice". He added: "They are run by teachers, not local bureaucrats or Westminster politicians, and are free to set their own curriculum, decide how they spend their money and employ who they think are the best people for the job. This government is not going to take these freedoms away." A Downing Street spokesman said earlier that, as recently as last week, the Lib Dem schools minister David Laws had said he was "100% behind the coalition's free schools policy, which makes Nick Clegg's comments all the more surprising". Michael Gove's allies have accused Mr Clegg of "fundamentally misunderstanding" the nature of free schools. Lib Dem sources have told the BBC that Mr Clegg argued for his proposed changes in cabinet but they were blocked by the education secretary. But Mr Clegg said current education policy was "something for Mr Gove" to handle and that he did not interfere in the workings of his department. Under plans announced by Labour, parent groups and other organisations would be able to set up schools outside local authority control, although local authorities would have greater powers to intervene when there were concerns about standards. But last week, shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said a future Labour government would allow most existing free schools to remain open. </body>

      <body>The brother-in-law of a Sheffield man who drowned in the sea off Cyprus while saving a man in difficulty has spoken of the family's loss. Keith West, 50, had been holidaying on the island with his fiancee Julie Davies while the couple planned their wedding there next year. Mr West was caught in an undercurrent on 14 October after rescuing a man. His brother-in-law, Steve Robjohns, said Mr West "would not have hesitated" to help someone in danger. "Keith was an old fashioned Yorkshireman. He was brilliant, he was true, and there wasn't a bad bone in his body. "It doesn't come as a surprise to me that he's done what he's done," said Mr Robjohns. It is believed Mr West was walking along the beach with his fiancee when he saw a man in trouble in the water and tried to help, said Mr Robjohns. He managed to save the man but was then caught by a wave and pulled under the water. Mr West had been submerged for about 10 minutes before a lifeguard found him and he could not be resuscitated. Ms Davies was "badly cut up" about her partner's death, said Mr Robjohns. "She has just had him pulled away from her and she can't get to grips with the fact she's never going to see him again," he said. "It's truly awful and all our hearts and minds go out to Julie who absolutely loved him to bits. It's truly heart-rending stuff." The Foreign Office said it was aware of the death of a British national on Cyprus and was providing consular assistance to the family. </body>

      <body>Google shares have topped $1,000 (£617) for the first time, jumping 13.8% on Friday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. Shares in the online giant closed 122 points up at $1,011.4, and have risen 42% since the start of 2013. Friday's share price rise followed the company posting a 36% jump in net profits to $2.97bn for the July-to-September period on Thursday. Google's revenues also beat forecasts with a 12% rise year-on-year. "We are closing in on our goal of a beautiful, simple, and intuitive experience regardless of your device," Google's chief Larry Page said in a conference call with analysts. The strong earnings report also helped other online companies, with Facebook shares adding 4.4% to a new high of more than $55. Amazon rose 3.4%. Google's market value is about $334bn, which is still well below Apple's $461bn. Google was floated in August 2004 at $85 a share, giving the company a market value at the time of $23bn. The company reported its quarterly earnings on Thursday after US markets had closed. Google said that paid-for clicks increased by a quarter during the July-to-September period, from a year earlier, the highest rate of growth in the past year. This offset an 8% fall in average cost-per-click, the price advertisers pay Google when consumers click on their ads. "We view solid paid clicks growth to be a good indicator of demand, driven by the continued shift to mobile," JP Morgan analysts said in a note. Several brokers have raised their share price target for Google on the back of the company's new initiatives to attract advertisers. In February, the company launched a service to help advertisers market through a mix of smartphones, tablets and desktop computers. And analysts believe there is still significant potential to generate revenues from its video-streaming website YouTube. YouTube-branded video-ads surged more than 75% in the quarter from a year earlier, with 40% of traffic now coming from mobile devices. "We estimate that Google's key YouTube asset generated approximately $4bn in revenue in 2012, positioning Google extremely well for the strong growth in video advertising," RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. Analysts at Jefferies said Google is best positioned to benefit from mobile devices with one billion activations of its Android system. Google sells applications and content through its Google Play store. </body>

      <title>China's economic growth speeds up</title>
      <description>China's economic growth picks up pace in the July-to-September period according to officials figures - the first rise in three quarters.</description>

      <body>China's economic growth picked up pace in the July-to-September period, the first rise in three quarters. The world's second-biggest economy grew 7.8% from a year earlier, up from 7.5% expansion in the previous quarter. The official figures also showed growth in industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment. After years of blistering growth, China has seen its pace of expansion slow recently and there have been fears that growth may slow further. China has set a growth target of 7.5% for the year. Analysts said the latest numbers indicated that it was likely that Beijing would meet this. "This is an indication that China's economic growth is holding up in a range which is within the comfort zone of both the Chinese policymakers as well as global watchers," said Song Seng Wun, a senior economist with CIMB Research . Over the past few decades China has relied heavily on its exports and manufacturing sectors as well as government-led infrastructure spending to help boost growth. However, a slowdown in key markets such as the US and Europe has hurt demand for its exports. As a result, it has been trying to spur domestic demand to offset the decline in foreign sales and also to rebalance its growth. Earlier this year, it unveiled fresh measures to help boost the economy. From 1 August, China has suspend value-added tax (VAT) and turnover tax for small businesses with monthly sales of less than 20,000 yuan ($3,257; £2,125). The cabinet said the move would benefit more than six million small companies and boost employment and income for millions of people. Policymakers said they would also implement measures to simplify customs clearance procedures, cut operational fees and facilitate the exports of small and medium-sized private enterprises. The cabinet also announced plans to completely open China's railway construction market to private investors to develop the sector further. It said it would set up a railway development fund, with the initial money coming from the government. Analysts said the moves were starting to have an impact on the growth numbers. "There is certainly a build up of momentum among the small manufacturers, which is an indication that China's policies targeted at them are working," said Tony Nash, vice-president at IHS. Factory output rose 10.2% in September, from a year earlier. Meanwhile, retail sales rose 13.3% and fixed asset investment jumped 20.2% during the month from levels a year ago. Tim Condon of ING added that the measures may help China sustain its growth rate in the current quarter as well. "The mini-stimulus we've seen is enough to keep it going at this pace in the fourth quarter," Mr Condon said. However, there have been some concerns over whether the economic rebound is sustainable in the long run, not least due to the continued rise in property prices. Property prices have now risen for eight months in a row, despite government efforts to cool the market. Some analysts have said that China's new leaders, who took charge in March, have so far tolerated the price rises due to concerns over slowing economic growth. According to some estimates, about 25% of overall investment in China goes towards property, making it one of the most important growth sectors. But the continued surge in prices has fanned fears that asset bubbles may be forming. "Between real estate and the lending environment, there are concerns that things may be heating up," said Mr Nash of IHS. "If not addressed properly, and in time, it could pose a serious threat to China's growth." Analysts said that with growth rebounding, Beijing may take measures to try and curb speculation in the property market. "We think the recovery in the third quarter was mainly driven by the strong momentum of the property market," said Shen Jianguang, chief China economist with Mizuho Securities in Hong Kong. "The government concerns about an over-heated property market are increasing, and tougher measures to curb rising prices may be forthcoming. "We expect gross domestic product (GDP) growth will slow to 7.6% in the fourth quarter," he added. </body>

      <title>Toyota to recall 885,000 vehicles</title>
      <description>Toyota is recalling 885,000 vehicles, mainly in North America, to fix a problem that could lead to airbags being disabled or inadvertently deploying.</description>

      <body>Toyota is recalling 885,000 vehicles to fix a problem that could cause a water leak from the air conditioning unit. It said water could leak into the airbag control module, causing a short circuit and triggering a warning light. In some cases airbags "could become disabled or could inadvertently deploy" and in limited cases the power steering function could be disabled, it added. The models affected by the recall are the Camry, Camry Hybrid, Avalon, Avalon Hybrid, and Venza made in 2012-13. Some 847,000 cars will be recalled in North America, while the rest will be in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. A spokeswoman for Toyota told the BBC that it had received reports of two minor injuries due to the issue, but there had been no reports of any vehicles crashing. This is the third major recall that Toyota has issued in recent weeks. Last month, the company called back more than 780,000 vehicles in the US to address a suspension defect in its RAV4 and Lexus HS 250h models, after fears that an initial recall last year did not fix the problem. In September, it recalled 615,000 Sienna minivans in the US to fix a lever problem that could cause vehicles to shift out of park mode "without the driver depressing the brake pedal". Toyota said at the time that it was aware of 24 "minor accidents" due to the issue. In recent weeks more than 2.2 million vehicles have been recalled. Analysts said the recalls could have an impact on its reputation with the customers. "Repeated recalls definitely dent the image of any carmaker," Vivek Vaidya, an auto analyst with consulting firm Frost and Sullivan told the BBC. "If you have one big recall, it is still manageable. But if (a company) calls back different vehicle models at different times for unrelated issues, customers tend to have a re-think about your quality assurance. "And if the problem involves airbag deployment - it becomes a serious issue," he added. The latest move takes the total number of cars recalled by Toyota this year to six million vehicles. </body>

      <body>Jorge Lorenzo's MotoGP world title hopes remain alive after he won a dramatic Australian Grand Prix which saw championship leader Marc Marquez disqualified. Yamaha's Lorenzo, who started from pole and led throughout, now trails his fellow Spaniard by 18 points going into next week's penultimate race in Japan. Riders had to change bikes mid-race because of safety concerns over tyres. But Marquez failed to pit by the required time and scored no points. After the race, BBC Sport's MotoGP presenter Matt Roberts tweeted  that Marquez's Honda team had said it was a pit-board error which led to their rider being disqualified. Dani Pedrosa was second while Valentino Rossi held off the challenge of Britain's Cal Crutchlow for third. Lorenzo described the race as "crazy" because of the compulsory bike change but his maximum return of 25 points, coupled with Marquez failing to register, means the title race has been opened up. "We were lucky," said Lorenzo. "Without the mistake from Marc I think he would have been first or second - now the championship has changed so much. "Before the race we had no chance - a 2% or 3% chance - and now it's 20% or 30%. "Let's see what happens in Motegi." [the venue for next Sunday's race in Japan] After setting the fastest time in qualifying, Lorenzo started well from pole and held off Marquez and Pedrosa in the opening lap before looking very comfortable. Tyre supplier Bridgestone said before the race that they were unable to guarantee the safety of their rear slick tyres beyond 10 laps because of the newly-resurfaced track at Phillip Island. As a result, it was decided to shorten the race to 19 laps from 27, with a mid-race pit stop. Pedrosa was the first of the top three to pit on lap nine, while Lorenzo made his change on the following lap. However, Marquez stayed out on the track until lap 11 and when he rejoined the race he had a minor clash with Lorenzo for top spot but the race leader retained his advantage. Marquez's hopes of securing the title in his rookie season then suffered a blow when he was shown the black flag for exceeding the maximum number of laps permitted before having to pit. Result 1.

      <description>England second row Courtney Lawes stars as Northampton beat Ospreys to go second in Pool One of the Heineken Cup.</description>

      <body>England lock Courtney Lawes impressed as Northampton beat Ospreys to go second in Pool One of the Heineken Cup. A Samu Manoa try and Stephen Myler conversion and penalty gave Northampton the lead before Dan Biggar landed two penalties for the visitors. Christian Day's converted try made it 17-6 at the break, only for Ospreys to hit back through a try, conversion and penalty from Biggar. But Ben Foden added a third Northampton try and Myler's boot saw Saints home. The hosts will be frustrated not to have secured a bonus point for scoring four tries, with George Pisi held a couple of feet short from a last-gasp Northampton attack, but in the end they were convincing winners. Lawes, along with fellow England forwards Dylan Hartley and Tom Wood, was outstanding in all facets of the game, although the lock's work at the line-out and in the tackle - he made 20 - was particularly noteworthy. And the 6ft 7in second row set the tone from the first whistle as he drilled Tom Habberfield backwards when the Ospreys scrum-half caught the kick-off. George North then hammered into midfield and an Ospreys offside gave Myler the chance to kick the hosts into the lead. When Manoa picked up from the base of a five-metre scrum and went over untouched, with Myler converting, with less than 15 minutes played it seemed as though Northampton were set for an easy win. But Ospreys, who went into the game on the back of a disappointing home defeat by Leinster, were determined to put up a fight and two Biggar penalties cut the gap to four points. However, Northampton were looking by far the more threatening side and they added to their lead almost immediately. Luther Burrell made a couple of big carries into midfield before the hosts went wide and Lawes - who had started things with a soaring line-out take - sent second row partner Day over in the corner for a converted score. It was turning into a spectacular game, with Northampton fizzing the ball about at pace but unable to finish things off, and the visitors prepared to counter-attack whenever they were presented with the opportunity. They turned round 17-6 down, needing to score next if the match was not to run away from them, and they duly lifted their game after the restart. Captain Alun Wyn Jones was at the heart of their charge and after he was held inches short, Biggar wriggled his way over by the posts before adding the conversion. Suddenly there were only four points in it and Northampton's cause was not helped as Myler missed a simple penalty, but approaching the hour mark they stretched clear again. The Saints pack bullied their way to within inches of the line from a line-out drive before Lee Dickson sent full-back Foden over unopposed. Myler converted from out wide and an exchange of penalties by the two fly-halves concluded the scoring, with a potentially important fourth try for Saints proving elusive.

      <title>Depp gives award to Christopher Lee</title>
      <description>Actor Sir Christopher Lee says receiving his British Institute Fellowship from Johnny Depp was a "very emotional moment", as Ida, a depiction of the Holocaust, wins the best film prize at London Film Festival.</description>

      <body>Hammer horror star Sir Christopher Lee said it was a "very emotional moment" when he received his British Institute Fellowship from his friend Johnny Depp. He tearfully accepted the award at the London Film Festival, saying: "I didn't know you were going to be here. I must try and pull myself together." The prize for best film went to to Pawel Pawlikowski's Ida, about German occupation of Poland and the Holocaust. Screenwriter Jonathan Asser won best British newcomer. He took the accolade for his debut feature Starred Up, about the practice of placing violent young offenders prematurely in adult prison. BFI fellow and film critic Philip French said of Ida that the jury was "deeply moved by a courageous film that handles, with subtlety and insight, a painfully controversial historical situation". Sir Christopher, 91, who described receiving his award as "a great joy", is famed for his villainous portrayals of Bond bad guy Scaramanga and evil wizard Saruman in The Lord of the Rings. He has amassed more than 250 screen credits, including The Wicker Man, The Man with the Golden Gun and more recently, several Tim Burton films including Sleepy Hollow, which starred Depp. He also played Count Dooku in the Star Wars prequels. Depp, who sneaked into the awards ceremony to surprise his friend, said it was his "great honour" to present the award to "a very great man", saying he had been "fascinated and inspired" by him. "He's been a wonderful individual and over the years I've had the pleasure of working with him and it has been a childhood dream come true," he said. "But as great as it is to work with him, that pleasure doesn't compare with getting to know him and being able to count him as a true friend. "A national treasure and a genuine artist. I love ya!" Sir Christopher responded by saying: "I can't thank you enough," in reference to Depp, who he had been told could not make the occasion as he was elsewhere. He went on : "When I take a look back, and it's a long one, 67 years, at the characters I've played I get a truly strange feeling they were all played by somebody else, and not by me. "And there are a few occasions when it has been the case I wish it had!" He said of Depp: "He means an enormous amount to me. He is one of very few young actors on screen today who's truly a star. "Everything he does has a meaning. He's a joy to work with, an actor's dream and certainly a director's dream. I could go on a long time but I'd probably embarrass him." The festival presented the Sutherland Award, for the most original and imaginative film debut, to Anthony Chen, who directed Ilo Ilo, which explores the life and vulnerabilities of a modern affluent family in Singapore. The Grierson award for the best documentary went to Paul-Julien Robert's My Fathers, My Mother and Me, a portrayal of life in Friedrichshof, the largest commune in Europe, which was founded in the 70s. The film reveals the devastating emotional effects of life there on its residents, and jury president Kate Ogborn said the "disturbing film" raised "larger questions of power, parental responsibility and abuse". The film festival closes later with the world premiere of Saving Mr Banks, a dramatisation of the making of 1964 movie Mary Poppins starring Emma Thompson as author PL Travers and Tom Hanks as Walt Disney. Hanks appeared at Bafta's London headquarters on Saturday to give a Life in Pictures talk, during which he revealed some of the difficulties he faced playing "Uncle Walt" on screen. "Walt Disney died of lung cancer; he smoked three packs a day," the two-time Oscar winner told host Francine Stock. "But can we show him smoking in a major motion picture these days? No way in hell. "It's this thing that has happened in movies - real people can't smoke. We literally had a negotiation over whether I could hold a lit cigarette in a scene." In a wide-ranging discussion covering his 30-year film career, Hanks said his success was partly down to his not having "a bigger-than-life persona". "I'm charming as hell, but I don't strike fear and I don't have a huge amount of mystery," he explained. "You're not worried about me killing you, or stealing your daughter, or being some sort of criminal mastermind. "I view myself as a guy that if I had been a good student, I could be a historian," he continued. "And if I had been good at science, I could be a doctor. "I'm not good at any of those things so I'm an actor. These movies, these roles, they're always something that - if I was a little more accomplished - I could be that guy." Hanks can currently be seen in cinemas in Captain Phillips, which opened the London Film Festival on 9 October. Saving Mr Banks is out in the UK on 29 November. </body>

      <body>Stars including Simon Pegg and Matt Lucas have expressed their sorrow at the death of comic and actor Felix Dexter, who died on Friday of cancer. The St Kitts-born Londoner, 52, had suffered from myeloma, a type of bone marrow cancer. Star Trek and Shaun of the Dead star Pegg tweeted: "Very sad to hear news of his passing. Very funny man." Little Britain's Lucas added that the Real McCoy star was: "A brilliant performer and ...a very nice man." Comedian and QI panellist Alan Davis added his voice to the tributes, saying that his memories of Dexter went back a long way. He tweeted: "Sad and shocked to hear about Felix Dexter passing away. So many gigs with him back in the olden days. Always a pleasure. RIP Felix." Fellow comic and presenter Dara O Briain linked on Twitter to a clip of Dexter performing as "the accountant" in 90s flagship black comedy The Real McCoy, adding he was "so sad" to hear the news. Comedian and star of The Infidel Omid Djalili described Dexter as "one of the very few who made me howl", while actor David Schneider tweeted: "Lovely, lovely guy. And I think nothing on TV has ever made me laugh more than his Real McCoy Nigerian character", referencing the Real McCoy clip linked to by O Briain. Actor David Morrissey, who has starred in TV series The Walking Dead and State of Play, said he worked with Dexter a while ago, describing him as a "funny, talented and generous man". Comedian Jenny Eclair added: "Terribly sad news about a very nice man who did a lot of fabulous work." Former Brookside star Louis Emerick said Dexter was a "very funny, talented man, gentleman!" tweeting: "Gone too soon." Dexter moved to the UK when he was aged seven and came to prominence in The Real McCoy and later performed for a season with the Royal Shakespeare Company. More recently, he played three of the main roles in BBC Two's sketch show Bellamy's People and is currently appearing in Citizen Khan. The Fast Show's Paul Whitehouse acted with Dexter in Bellamy's People. Whitehouse told BBC Radio 5 live he was privileged to be close to the comedian and actor. "He was a very modest, a very private man," he said. "It was an honour to be close to him. "He stuck in people's minds, Felix. There's been such an outpouring of warmth and affection for him." </body>

      <description>The fantastical farmers' sheds in demand as holiday homes</description>

      <body>The latest property of choice for holiday home buyers in Southern Italy is not a rustic villa or a rambling farmhouse - it is a former farmer's shed, which would not look out of place on the set of Lord of the Rings. Trulli are the trademark of Puglia - existing nowhere but the Valley of Itria. Round limestone buildings with conical roofs, they are as magical as they are historical. Dotted across the landscape, alone or in clusters, with one cone or even a dozen, they look like miniature rustic fairytale castles - Asterix meets Disney. Originally nothing more than farmers' sheds used to store equipment or animals, the structure is made with the same drystone technique as the low walls that demarcate the olive groves. No cement, just local limestone cut into large, heavy slabs called chiancarelle - carefully positioned to make the perfect water-tight structure. It is said that back in the 1600s, when there was a tax on new buildings, the locals built trulli so they could be dismantled when the inspectors came and rebuilt after they had gone. In between viewings estate agent, Alessandro Melpignano tells us enthusiastically about the trullo revival. They became trendy holiday homes when the Trulli of Alberobello became a Unesco world heritage site in 1996. "That is when the market really exploded", he explains. The first to buy were the Germans, who soon got fed up with break-ins. The British were hot on their heels. "But they have stayed," says Melpignano. "And they are still buying. Low-cost flights to Bari and Brindisi have helped keep them coming." Trulli need renovating every 100 to 150 years. It takes around a month to rebuild a cone and costs about 15,000 euros (£12,700). Do they have experts who renovate and rebuild trulli? "Oh yes," he grins. "They are called trullari. And I know a master trullaro." The next morning I go in search of Giovanni d'Errico and find him, unsurprisingly, building a trullo. If anybody ever looked the part, it is d'Errico, who bears an uncanny resemblance to a Hobbit. He tells me he has always been passionate about trulli, but when he was young, nobody cared about them. "They were mostly abandoned ruins. People saw them as hovels for the poor." "I became a trullaro about 20 years ago. Before that I was a tiler. When I began, there was just one trullaro left in this area. It was a dying trade. Now there are loads of us." I wonder if d'Errico thinks tourists are mad for falling in love with old farmers' sheds? On the contrary, he says he is supremely grateful. "They gave us work and a bit of well-being - they brought our abandoned land back to life. "Even if it has slowed down with the recession and heavy taxes on homeowners, our profession's still growing. I do not make a fortune but I do love my job. It is a beautiful thing that everyone wants a trullo." According to Giuseppe Miccolis, another master trullaro specialising in historic trulli, "the problem is that anyone can set himself up as a trullaro without any formal training or qualification". Miccolis, who comes from a long line of trullari, was born into the profession. "At the age of three, I used to play with the stones. At 14 I started working." He considers his trade an art and a passion. But it is tinged with disappointment and frustration. "It is not just the unskilled self-styled trullari, it is the people who build illegally without respecting our landscape." Nevertheless, Giuseppe is determined to preserve his beloved traditional craft. He has begun taking school children on walks, visiting historic trulli and explaining and demonstrating how they are built. "I am hoping to inspire local kids to develop the passion my family passed on to me. I am going to organise walks for tourists too," he says. "Why don't you come back for one?" My eyes light up.

      <body>Balkh province in northern Afghanistan is home to some of the most significant historical sites in the world - its ancient city was even known as the mother of all cities. More than a decade after her first visit, Lynne O'Donnell returns with a group of archaeologists, trying to uncover more of its treasures. Across the far northern Afghan plain, a hot wind blows the dun-coloured dust into blinding clouds, and the women's burkas into blue billows. It is 40C in the shade, and even the small black goats being herded through the sand dunes look sapped by the heat. These are the lowlands of Balkh, where ancient trade routes attracted nomads, warriors, settlers, adventurers and evangelists, who left behind secrets that archaeologists are just beginning to unlock. This area places Afghanistan at the heart of political, economic, social and religious power across Asia, as far back as 4,000 years ago. The last time I drove across the Bactrian plain was in 2001. I had sailed down the Amu Darya river on a barge from Uzbekistan as British and American forces were pounding the Taliban after the 9/11 attacks in the US. I have returned 12 years later with Afghan and French archaeologists to tour some of the oldest, most magnificent and historically significant sites in the world - sites that are shedding light not only on Afghanistan's past, but on the development of human civilisation, from India to China and beyond. The Bactrian plain is the treasure house of Afghanistan's secret history. Across this desert, Alexander the Great marched his army, killed the king of Balkh and married his beautiful daughter, Roxanne. Some 1,500 years later, Genghis Khan swept through and destroyed teeming cities that were melting pots of diversity. The philosopher Zoroaster, founder of the first monotheistic religion 3,500 years ago, lived and possibly died here. Rumi, the 13th Century poet who wrote in Persian, was born in Balkh - and is also, some Afghans like to think, buried here. Camel trains, loaded with freshly harvested cotton, lope across the parched landscape, against a backdrop of mud walls built to stop the encroachment of the desert on the fertile Balkh oasis. The French archaeologists are here to take a sample of the walls which surrounded a huge hexagonal fort, its shape only visible on satellite photos, strategically placed for both defence and water. They dig deep in to the foundations to fill a metal pipe with dirt, so scientists in Paris can gauge the last time the quartz in the clay saw light. For now, they are guessing around 2,500 years. Nearby in Dawlatabad is the tiny hospitable village of Zadian. We can only go with an armed police escort as the Taleban are active. Little girls in colourful scarves run squealing from the communal water pump as I raise my camera. Men in baggy trousers and turbans emerge to greet us from a shady walled garden. I look up, and my jaw drops. Against the flawless blue sky, a sun-baked clay minaret towers over us. It was built in the 12th Century, still nameless, missed by Ghengis Khan and his marauding Mongols - and by most visitors to this corner of the world ever since. In the oasis of Cheshma-e-Shifa, a huge white rock shaped like an anvil is the sole evidence of a city where Zoroastrian priests performed rituals for the thousands of people who lived here, 600 years before Christ. On the altar's flattened top is a well for oil which burned a perpetual flame that would have been visible across the valley. The French like to wonder if it was here that Alexander married Roxanne. French archaeologists have worked in Balkh for almost 100 years, interrupted by wars and invasions and, in the late 1990s, by the Taliban, who believed history only began with Islam in the 7th Century. In fact, in Afghanistan, Islam displaced Buddhism. The Taliban showed their contempt for history when they destroyed the giant Buddhas of Bamiyan in 2001. Today, archaeologists are confirming Afghanistan's role in spreading prosperity and philosophy across a quarter of the world for thousands of years. For them, the greatness of the past is an example for the future, and in Balkh they see not the violence of the present, but the romance of antiquity. The original Balkh is one of the oldest cities in history. All that remains is a dusty field surrounded by monumental walls that are slowly being revealed by painstaking excavations. In seven years, about 20 metres of the foundations have been unearthed. Visible from the top of the walls are the courtyards of the modern village. Here washing hangs, children chase dogs, donkeys pull carts, and the hot wind blows up endless clouds of dust. In Balkh, whatever comes next when the war ends and foreign troops leave the country next year, will soon be absorbed into Afghanistan's long history.

      <body>Singapore has achieved what only a handful of countries have - joining the so-called First World from the developing world. The city-state transformed itself from a British colonial outpost into the country with the third highest average income in the world within a matter of decades. Not only that, it has become an international financial centre attracting expatriates from across the globe. Foreign workers make up 40% of Singapore's labour market. Exporting consumer electronics has been the driver of growth for Asia since the 1960s, including for Singapore, which has also made the most of one of its few natural advantages, a deep water sea port. For Working Lives, the BBC's Linda Yueh has been meeting people around the island. Wang Han, a young Singaporean design engineer, is the type of highly skilled worker that leads international companies to set up plants in such an expensive country. She works on the innovative digital motor that powers hand dryers and vacuum cleaners for UK company Dyson. The motor is made in Singapore, but the products using it are assembled in Malaysia and sold around the world. That international outlook and the government's promotion of skilled workers also attracts foreigners to Singapore. Frazer Macdonald Hay came to teach young Singaporeans how to integrate design into engineering. He heads a 10-year programme between the Glasgow School of Art and Singapore's Institute of Technology. Chris Gill was attracted by the government's promotion of the financial sector, and a safe, clean environment to bring up his young family. He heads a global insurance company's Asian headquarters based in Singapore. Property developer Satinder Garcha, who according to one survey is Singapore's 46th richest person, plays polo each afternoon in the middle of the city, giving him a rather enviable work-life balance. But it's not just the rich who have a good standard of living. Office cleaner Liew Siew Giok works all day on her feet but goes home to a meal cooked by her Burmese maid. She lives with her extended family, who pay for the domestic help and her flat. The influx of foreigners has created social tensions and the rapid growth of the financial sector has raised some concerns about the future. However, what is clear is that Singapore has grown by being at the leading edge of know-how, giving not just the rich, but most people, a good quality of life. </body>

      <title>Schools rift 'not a crisis' - Clegg</title>
      <description>The deputy prime minister distances the Liberal Democrats from the government's free schools policy, but insists there is no "great coalition crisis" over the issue.</description>

      <body>Nick Clegg has denied there is a "great coalition crisis", ahead of a speech in which he will distance the Liberal Democrats from part of the government's policy on free schools. The deputy prime minister will argue free schools must follow the national curriculum and should not allow unqualified people to teach. But he told Sky News this was part of a "grown-up" debate between the parties. Downing Street had expressed surprise at Mr Clegg's comments. Free schools, set up by parents and other groups, are state-funded but operate outside local authority control. They were established under a policy pioneered by Education Secretary Michael Gove and since September 2011 more than 170 have been opened across England. Currently free schools have discretion over what to teach, but in his speech to a school in north London on Thursday, Mr Clegg will ask: "What's the point of having a national curriculum if only a few schools have to teach it?" His next party manifesto will also say all schools should adhere to new standards on meals and demand that teachers are either qualified or near qualification. Last week, the head teacher of a primary free school in London, who was still studying for her postgraduate certificate in education, stood down following criticism from Labour councillors. There was also controversy when the Al-Madinah free school in Derby was classed as inadequate by education inspectors. In his speech to a London school this week, Mr Clegg will say: "I'm proud of our work over the last three years to increase school autonomy, which, in government with the Conservatives, has been through the academies programme." But he will go on to question "aspects of schools policy currently affected by the priorities of the Conservative Party which I would not want to see continue". Mr Clegg will add: "Whilst I want to give schools the space to innovate, I also believe every parent needs reassurance that the school their child attends, whatever its title or structure, meets certain core standards of teaching and care. A parental guarantee, if you like." Appearing on Sky News, he said he was a supporter of free schools, but his concern was about maintaining standards. He said: "Most head teachers and parents would expect that the teachers who teach their children have the proper qualifications." Asked whether his comments were a signal that the Lib Dems were moving closer to Labour's policy, with a view to possible coalition-forming after the next general election, Mr Clegg said this was "complete and utter nonsense". He added that "tensions" were part of being in coalition and said: "It's not a political crisis when some of those differences are articulated in public." A Department for Education spokesman said free schools were "raising standards and giving parents more choice". He added: "They are run by teachers, not local bureaucrats or Westminster politicians, and are free to set their own curriculum, decide how they spend their money and employ who they think are the best people for the job. This government is not going to take these freedoms away." A Downing Street spokesman said earlier that, as recently as last week, the Lib Dem schools minister David Laws had said he was "100% behind the coalition's free schools policy, which makes Nick Clegg's comments all the more surprising". Michael Gove's allies have accused Mr Clegg of "fundamentally misunderstanding" the nature of free schools. Lib Dem sources have told the BBC that Mr Clegg argued for his proposed changes in cabinet but they were blocked by the education secretary. But Mr Clegg said current education policy was "something for Mr Gove" to handle and that he did not interfere in the workings of his department. Under plans announced by Labour, parent groups and other organisations would be able to set up schools outside local authority control, although local authorities would have greater powers to intervene when there were concerns about standards. But last week, shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said a future Labour government would allow most existing free schools to remain open. </body>

      <title>Deadly truck bomb rocks Syrian city</title>
      <description>At least 30 people are killed by a suicide truck bombing targeting government troops on the edge of the central Syrian city of Hama.</description>

      <body>At least 30 people have been killed by a suicide truck bombing on the edge of the central Syrian city of Hama. State news agency Sana said Syrian rebels had driven a truck laden with over a tonne of explosives into a government checkpoint on a busy road. The explosion appears to have set ablaze a nearby petrol tanker, increasing the damage and casualties. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front carried out the attack. "A man detonated a truck laden with explosives at a checkpoint near an agricultural vehicles company on the road linking Hama to Salamiya," the Observatory said. It said the attack had targeted government soldiers, but that most of the dead were civilians. Pictures on Syria TV showed firemen battling to contain fires as black smoke rose from charred trucks and cars. A man who received leg injuries in the blast told Syrian state TV: "I was heading to a school in Salamiya and the blast started. "These innocent people don't deserve this. The scene is inhumane. These terrorists shouldn't be in this country." Hama saw some of the largest demonstrations against the rule of President Bashar al-Assad in the first months after the Syrian uprising began in March 2011. But in late summer 2011, security forces stormed the city and have maintained control ever since. Hama occupies a significant place in the history of modern Syria. In 1982, then-President Hafez al-Assad, father of Bashar, sent in troops to quell an uprising by the Sunni opposition Muslim Brotherhood. Tens of thousands were killed and the town flattened. Meanwhile, the head of the Arab League has said that a long-awaited conference on Syria will begin on 23 November, although this falls short of a formal announcement. Nabil el-Arabi was speaking after meeting the international envoy on Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, who is on a tour of the Middle East to prepare for the conference. Mr Brahimi did not himself publicly set a date, saying he would do so after his tour. Mr el-Arabi conceded that there were still many obstacles ahead. Western and Arab government officials will meet Syrian opposition leaders on Tuesday to try to persuade them to attend. </body>

      <title>Australia declares fire emergency</title>
      <description>A state of emergency is declared in New South Wales as Australian firefighters battle bushfires that are expected to worsen in hot and windy weather.</description>

      <body>A state of emergency has been declared in New South Wales as Australian firefighters battle bushfires that have already destroyed more than 200 homes. The announcement comes as conditions look set to deteriorate with soaring temperatures and strong winds expected to fan the flames in the coming days. The Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, has been the worst-hit region with some fires still raging out of control. State officials say they are the most dangerous conditions in 40 years. New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell said the declaration would give emergency services additional powers over the next 30 days. These could include cutting gas and power supplies if needed and ordering mandatory evacuations. "We're planning for the worst but hoping for the best," he said. One man has died - possibly of a heart attack - while trying to protect his home. Hundreds of people have been left homeless by the bushfires. One firefighter, 24-year-old Tim Boxwell, said he had lost his own home in Winmalee, on the eastern edge of the Blue Mountains, to the fire while he was on duty. "I'd been standing watching other people's houses burn and the emotion from that was bad enough. To be hit with your own house being lost was a shock as well," he told BBC's Newshour. Officials have warned that the three main bushfires - two in the Blue Mountains and one near the town of Lithgow - could become one huge fire in the coming days, possibly threatening Sydney. A fire service spokesman said: "We can understand the magnitude of that as it would then creep into the bottom end of Sydney. It's certainly something that we're very concerned about." The foot of the Blue Mountains lies just across the Nepean River from the suburbs of Sydney. Some embers jumped its banks last Thursday, starting a fire at Castlereagh near Penrith. After several cooler days, forecasters are predicting the return of unseasonably hot weather - with temperatures reaching 30C (86F) and higher. The heat wave would probably peak on Wednesday, warned Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons, but there would be little relief in the intervening period. "We've got what would be unparalleled in terms of risk and exposure to the Blue Mountains throughout this week. If you are to draw a parallel, and it's always dangerous to draw a parallel, at best you'd be going back to time periods in the late 60s. "The reality is, however, these conditions that we're looking at are a whole new ball game and in a league of their own," the commissioner said. Mr O'Farrell said crews had carried out controlled burn operations overnight to strengthen buffer zones around the major fires. An emergency warning was issued for the Blue Mountains village of Bell on Sunday morning. Residents were urged to evacuate or to take shelter "in a solid structure when the fire front arrives". Villagers in Mount Wilson and Mount Irvine, meanwhile, were ordered to stay in their homes after fire cut off access roads. Residents of nearby Bilpin were warned that if they did not evacuate, they could be isolated without power for several days. Assistant police commissioner Alan Clarke said mandatory evacuation orders would be enforced in some areas, describing the risk as "far more extreme" than in past fires. "At the end of the day we hope we have buildings standing, but if we don't have buildings standing we don't want bodies in them," he said. More than 37,000 hectares (91,400 acres) have already been ravaged by fire in the state in the past several days. Officials say that 15 blazes remain out of control. Smoke and ash from the bushfires have blanketed the Sydney skyline. Australia's military is currently investigating whether a training exercise using explosives may have started one of the fires. The exercise took place at a base near the town of Lithgow in the Blue Mountains region on Wednesday. In the past, many such fires have turned out to have been started deliberately, and police say they are monitoring dozens of "firebugs" - people with a history of committing arson, the BBC's Jon Donnison reports from Sydney. Our correspondent says the blazes have come unusually early in the season and follow Australia's hottest year on record.

      <title>Alps murders police 'covering up'</title>

      <body>The brother of a British man killed with his wife and mother-in-law while on holiday in the Alps has denied arranging their murder. Zaid al-Hilli, from Surrey, has accused French police of "covering up" the real target of the killings in 2012 and also offered to take a lie-detector test. He remains on bail after being arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. The French prosecutor said he was convinced there was a very serious feud between the brothers. Saad al-Hilli and his wife Iqbal, from Claygate, her mother Suhaila al-Allaf and French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, were shot on 5 September 2012. The bodies of the four victims were found on a remote forest road in Chevaline near Lake Annecy. The two young daughters survived the attack, one by hiding under her dead mother's skirt. Saad's brother Zaid, who is from Chessington, was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder amid claims he doctored documents to ensure he inherited the family estate following the death of their father. Zaid denied arranging the killings and said the accusations were "ridiculous." He rejected claims of a feud between the brothers over the inheritance. He said they got on well despite only communicating through their lawyers in the eleven months before the attack. "Our relationship was very brotherly and very close, and we looked after each other," he said. He declined to answer questions about his father's will because British police are investigating him for possible fraud. He said French police shut down their investigation into the murder of the cyclist, Sylvain Mollier, too soon. "They are covering up for someone in France in that region and they know it. "Sylvain Mollier was involved in family disputes and was an outsider to [his] rich family. There is something more to it locally... most crime has local roots." The French prosecutor, Eric Maillaud, has said he is sure the cyclist was there by accident and is convinced there was a feud between the brothers. "The police have investigated Sylvain Mollier's family as far as they could. There is nothing to link Mollier to this murder," he said. "The investigators have become convinced that Zaid tried to steal from his father, one way or another, and that there was a very serious feud between the two brothers. "Saad al-Hilli was afraid of his brother and had changed the locks at the house and fitted a new alarm." Mr Maillaud said French investigators will solve the mystery of the Annecy murders however long it takes.

      <title>Hayling Island 'hit by tornado'</title>
      <description>About 100 homes are damaged when a "tornado" hits Hayling Island in Hampshire.</description>

      <body>About 100 homes have been damaged by a "tornado" on Hayling Island in Hampshire, police have said. Havant Council said properties in Blackthorn Road and Ilex Walk were damaged by high winds at about 08:00 BST. The council said there were no reported injuries and its officers were assessing the damage to properties. Kayla Killshaw-Laing, who was staying on the island overnight, described the experience as "horrendous". Hampshire Constabulary has received calls regarding damaged vehicles, power lines, and beach huts. Highway teams are currently clearing up debris around the area. Ms Killshaw-Laing said: "There was this horrendous crashing sound… the dogs were barking so I went to the window and looked out and this huge tree just landed on top of my parents' car. "I was in a panic… I'm just staying here for the night, I was here to tidy their front garden, how ironic. "We've had to have chainsaws to saw the whole thing up and remove it, but the caravan flipped over next door." High winds also damaged properties several miles away in Gosport. Gaynor Wood, from the town, said: "The wind sucked the loft hatch cover into the roof space, slammed the bedroom doors and shut the window. "It was over very quickly and seems to have been extremely isolated - our house is semi-detached and yet the neighbours don't seem to have been hit. "The tiles bounced off the roof, scraped the front of the house and damaged two cars in the drive. "My husband's brand new car has had its roof pierced by roof tiles." Ian Hoult, head of emergency planning at Hampshire County Council, said a number of roofs had been damaged and trees uprooted. He said: "Fortunately we don't know of anyone being hurt, but it's an interesting situation for a Sunday morning." BBC Weather's Emma Boorman said heavy and thundery showers had moved across the area and gusts of between 45 and 50 mph were reported. She added: "The damage reported in Hayling Island is consistent with what you might expect from a small tornado, which is feasible in this weather situation." One or two tornados are typically reported along England's south coast each year, BBC Weather said.

      <title>Minister: Police culture will change</title>
      <description>Policing will become more open, with independent overseers given more powers to stamp out wrongdoing, a Home Office minister says.</description>

      <body>The "culture" of policing will improve, with independent overseers given "more powers" to investigate wrongdoing, a Home Office minister has pledged. Damian Green said the "Plebgate" investigation was "one incident among many", citing the Hillsborough cover-up and the death of Ian Tomlinson. But only a small minority of officers had acted inappropriately, he added. The Independent Police Complaints Commission was working to ensure greater "openness", Mr Green said. A Sunday Times poll by YouGov suggests 66% of the public trust the police, down from 71% in August. The figures come after several controversies involving police over the last few years. In August the Metropolitan Police apologised to the family of Ian Tomlinson over his death at the G20 protests in London in 2009, with one officer using "excessive" force. Last year David Cameron apologised for a police cover-up over the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 football fans died in 1989. And, on Wednesday, the chief constables of West Mercia, Warwickshire and West Midlands Police are due to appear before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee to explain the handling of a meeting between officers and former government Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell. The MP resigned after he was accused of calling Downing Street police "plebs" when they prevented him from riding a bicycle through gates leading into Whitehall in September last year. The meeting with officers, working as representatives of the Police Federation, was held during the weeks following the claims. A transcript of a recording Mr Mitchell made shows that, while he admitted swearing, he denied using the word "pleb" or insulting the police. But, after the meeting, three senior police officers said he had refused to elaborate on what had happened and should quit, which he later did. Mr Green said the officers' comments had been "palpably untrue", adding: "He deserves an apology." Mr Green added: "Andrew Mitchell clearly can command the resources that other people might not be able to prove that what individual police officers said about him wasn't true. So that's the key underlying issue." Mr Green said: "If police officers behave badly then it's really serious for the police. But it's a very small minority who behave badly. By and large the police do their job well." Citing the Sunday Times poll, he added: "Two-thirds of people still have confidence in the police, which is quite surprising given the spate of stories." However, the government was increasing resources for the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) and was changing police recruitment to ensure people with a background from outside the service could enter at a senior level. Mr Green said: "The fact that people will bring a new attitude and background will help the police service. It will open it up." He added: "The IPCC needs more powers and resources, We are giving it both. It's not just a question of following rules. It's a question of having a culture of openness and transparency." Former Metropolitan Police detective Peter Kirkham told the BBC's Sunday Politics there was not a "culture of deceit" among officers. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles told BBC One's Sunday Politics he had "always believed" Mr Mitchell's account of Plebgate. "I'd be honoured to sit with Andrew Mitchell in the cabinet," he said. </body>

      <body>A boy of 14 and an 18-year-old man arrested in connection with three sexual assaults near the University of Manchester have been released. They must return to a police station later for further questioning, Greater Manchester Police said. Officers had earlier released an e-fit of a boy, who they said could have been as young as 12, who they believed may have carried out the attacks. The police said they would continue to investigate the "appalling incidents". In the first incident, a 27-year-old was approached from behind and grabbed in Lloyd Street North at 18:15 BST. The woman screamed and the offender, who was described as being in his mid-teens and mixed race, threatened her. He grabbed her again before running away. The next incident followed minutes later when a 21-year-old woman was approached by a boy who made lewd comments as she left John Rylands University Library and walked along Oxford Road. She carried on walking on to Moss Lane East and was sexually assaulted by her assailant. The third attack took place at the Manchester Science Park in Lloyd Street North at about 14:15 BST on 5 October. A 32-year-old woman was using her mobile phone when she was approached by two young boys. She was sexually assaulted by one of the boys, who was described as being slim, Asian, wearing baggy trousers and carrying a rucksack, and aged about 12 or 13 years old. She pushed him away but he sexually assaulted her again before running off towards Pencroft Way with the second young boy, who was also described as being Asian. Det Ch Insp Colin Larkin thanked members of the public and the media "for their support and the information they have provided". He said he wanted to reassure the community that officers would "continue to investigate these appalling incidents so we so can establish all the facts and who is responsible". He added that he would like anyone who had any more information about the three attacks or any other incidents to come forward. </body>

      <title>Welby urges energy firm 'generosity'</title>
      <description>The Archbishop of Canterbury has entered the debate about energy prices by urging firms to act with generosity, rather than just maximising profit.</description>

      <body>The Archbishop of Canterbury has entered the debate about energy prices by urging firms to act with generosity, rather than just maximising profit. In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, the Most Reverend Justin Welby said he understood people who found the latest price hikes "inexplicable". The former oil executive said companies had to "justify fully" their actions. Last week, British Gas followed SSE's rises with a 9.2% increase in its dual-fuel bill price. The archbishop told the Mail on Sunday: "The impact on people, particularly on low incomes, is going to be really severe in this. "I do understand when people feel that this is inexplicable, and I can understand people being angry about it, because having spent years on a low income as a clergyman I know what it is like when your household budget is blown apart by a significant extra fuel bill and your anxiety levels become very high." Amid predictions that the four other major energy suppliers - EDF, E.On, npower, Scottish Power - will now also raise their prices, Archbishop Welby urged firms to be "conscious of their social obligations". He added they had to to "behave with generosity and not merely to maximise opportunity". "They have control because they sell something everyone has to buy. We have no choice about buying it," he said. "With that amount of power comes huge responsibility to serve society. "It is not like some other sectors of business where people can walk away from you if they don't want to buy your product and you are entitled to seek to maximise your profit. "The social licence to operate of the energy companies is something they have to take very, very seriously indeed." The archbishop, a member of the cross-party Banking Standards Commission, previously suggested the City of London has been affected by a "culture of entitlement" at variance with what others think reasonable and hit out at payday lenders charging high interest rates. He said he was concerned that fuel poverty was "a very severe issue... because real incomes are flat or declining and the cost of energy has gone up". "It ties in with the food banks and the debt," he said. "They are all part of the reality of life for many people today." The rise in energy costs has sparked a huge political debate with Labour leader Ed Miliband pledging a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. Prime Minister David Cameron has said he was "disappointed" by the rises but described Mr Miliband's plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. He has said consumers should look to switch suppliers to keep bills down. </body>

      <title>Call for whistle-blowing inquiry</title>
      <description>The government should launch an inquiry into how whistle-blowers are treated in the wake of the Orchid View care home scandal, Tory MP and health select committee member Charlotte Leslie says.</description>

      <body>Ministers must launch an inquiry into how whistle-blowers are treated in the wake of the Orchid View care home scandal, MP Charlotte Leslie has said. The Tory MP spoke after Lisa Martin revealed she had not worked since exposing abuse at Orchid View in Copthorne, West Sussex, in 2011. That was "an indictment of our system", Ms Leslie told BBC Radio 5 live. The government said it would be publishing plans on protecting whistle-blowers later this year. On Friday, at an inquest into 19 deaths at Orchid View, West Sussex coroner Penelope Schofield said the home was riddled with "institutionalised abuse". She ruled that neglect contributed to five of the deaths and said the home, then run by Southern Cross, was "mismanaged and understaffed". Orchid View has since reopened under a new name and new management. Ms Martin, who first told police about problems at the home, told 5 live on Saturday: "I do want to work back in care but I can't get a job in the care industry again. "Where I live is a very small village, next to Copthorne - everyone knows what went on. "It's just been an absolute nightmare for me. "Obviously I know, morally, that I did the right things. "Whether I would ever do that again - I probably wouldn't because it's had a huge impact on my life." Conservative MP Ms Leslie, who is also a member of the health select committee, told 5 live's Sunday Breakfast that Ms Martin's experience was "absolutely appalling but sadly it's becoming a recurring theme". "Whistle-blowers across the NHS and the care system do the right thing, stand up and save lives, in many cases. "And then other future employers look at them and, instead of saying, 'thank goodness - here's someone who can prevent bad things happening', they look at them and say 'here's a troublemaker'. "People who are saving lives are losing their jobs, losing their livelihoods and everything." She added: "That's why I think a whistle-blowing inquiry or review is needed into how we can ensure that whistle-blowing isn't needed - because management systems iron out these things before it gets to whistle-blowing - and how you can protect whistle-blowers." A spokesperson for the Department of Health (DoH) said staff in the health and social care sectors "should never be stopped from raising concerns about patient safety and the secretary of state for health has told trusts that doing this is unacceptable". "Staff should be able to speak out and we are determined to ensure that if individuals raise concerns about patient safety they are listened to," they added. The department said that, later this year, it would publish its response to a public inquiry report released in February into failings at Stafford Hospital which came after years of neglect led to the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of patients. Its response to the inquiry would "lay out how we plan on making sure whistle-blowers are not just protected but also praised for their courage and thanked by management". That would form "a key part of the effort to build the safe, effective and compassionate culture that patients, the public and the overwhelming majority of staff across health and social care expect", the spokesperson added. </body>

      <body>Criminals who trade in child abuse images are to be targeted in a new British-American task force. Police Minister Damian Green will fly to the US later to formalise arrangements for the new body. The agency will be co-chaired by Mr Green and US Attorney General Eric Holder. Mr Green said: "Child abuse and exploitation online are not restricted by borders and our efforts to combat them should not be either." He went on: "British and American parents rightly expect us to do all we can to protect our children and that is why I want to agree to a much closer working relationship in this area. "This agreement will only strengthen our ability to crack down on this sickening crime." Mr Green will sign a memorandum of understanding between the two countries in the next few days. The Sun on Sunday reported that as part of the trip Mr Green will meet senior figures within the FBI, Homeland Security and other law enforcement agencies. Internet companies are also being called on to share information with their British counterparts. The move follows the 22 July announcement from Prime Minister David Cameron that most households would have sexually explicit material blocked by the internet provider unless they chose to opt out. Joanna Shields, UK business ambassador for Digital Industries and a former Google and Facebook executive, will be the industry lead for the project. She told the Sun on Sunday: "The US-UK Taskforce will play a critical role in taking forward the Prime Minister's commitment to eradicating exploitative material from the internet and keeping our children safe online. "I strongly believe that industry and government can successfully tackle this problem together. "I look forward to working with the brightest minds in the industry to develop truly innovative and creative technical solutions that will help protect the most vulnerable in our society." </body>

      <body>A counter-piracy task force commanded by a Royal Navy officer has caught a group of Somalis believed responsible for two attacks in the Indian Ocean. Pirates had exchanged gunfire with a super tanker on Friday 11 October before attacking a Spanish fishing vessel three days later. Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) traced the pirates' skiffs from Britain's Royal Fleet Auxiliary Fort Victoria. Nine men were caught and forces later destroyed two boats and equipment. Commodore Jeremy Blunden, Royal Navy, Commander of CTF-151, said: "This is an excellent result. "My multinational counter piracy forces swiftly located and dealt with this Somali pirate group, sending a clear message that piracy no longer pays." Combined Task Force (CTF) 151, as the group is known, embarked on board RFA Fort Victoria with support from Australian guided-missile frigate HMAS Melbourne and South Korean destroyer ROKS Wang Geon. The European Union flagship Dutch HNLMS Johan de Witt - flagship of the EU naval force in the area - and maritime patrol aircraft from Luxembourg were also part of the mission. After tracing the pirates an HMAS Melbourne Seahawk guided the warship to their precise location, 500 nautical miles off the Somali coast, before a boarding team made the final approach to search the skiffs. Commander Brian Schlegel, Royal Australian Navy, commanded HMAS Melbourne during the operation. He said: "It is clear that there are still pirates out there determined to generate income from taking merchant ships hostage. "Mariners have been served a timely reminder of the perils of transiting the Somali coastline." CMF is a multinational naval partnership with 29 nation members. Its aim is to promotes security, stability and prosperity across 2.5 million square miles of international waters. </body>

      <body>Stars including Simon Pegg and Matt Lucas have expressed their sorrow at the death of comic and actor Felix Dexter, who died on Friday of cancer. The St Kitts-born Londoner, 52, had suffered from myeloma, a type of bone marrow cancer. Star Trek and Shaun of the Dead star Pegg tweeted: "Very sad to hear news of his passing. Very funny man." Little Britain's Lucas added that the Real McCoy star was: "A brilliant performer and ...a very nice man." Comedian and QI panellist Alan Davis added his voice to the tributes, saying that his memories of Dexter went back a long way. He tweeted: "Sad and shocked to hear about Felix Dexter passing away. So many gigs with him back in the olden days. Always a pleasure. RIP Felix." Fellow comic and presenter Dara O Briain linked on Twitter to a clip of Dexter performing as "the accountant" in 90s flagship black comedy The Real McCoy, adding he was "so sad" to hear the news. Comedian and star of The Infidel Omid Djalili described Dexter as "one of the very few who made me howl", while actor David Schneider tweeted: "Lovely, lovely guy. And I think nothing on TV has ever made me laugh more than his Real McCoy Nigerian character", referencing the Real McCoy clip linked to by O Briain. Actor David Morrissey, who has starred in TV series The Walking Dead and State of Play, said he worked with Dexter a while ago, describing him as a "funny, talented and generous man". Comedian Jenny Eclair added: "Terribly sad news about a very nice man who did a lot of fabulous work." Former Brookside star Louis Emerick said Dexter was a "very funny, talented man, gentleman!" tweeting: "Gone too soon." Dexter moved to the UK when he was aged seven and came to prominence in The Real McCoy and later performed for a season with the Royal Shakespeare Company. More recently, he played three of the main roles in BBC Two's sketch show Bellamy's People and is currently appearing in Citizen Khan. The Fast Show's Paul Whitehouse acted with Dexter in Bellamy's People. Whitehouse told BBC Radio 5 live he was privileged to be close to the comedian and actor. "He was a very modest, a very private man," he said. "It was an honour to be close to him. "He stuck in people's minds, Felix. There's been such an outpouring of warmth and affection for him." </body>

      <title>Depp gives award to Christopher Lee</title>
      <description>Actor Sir Christopher Lee says receiving his British Institute Fellowship from Johnny Depp was a "very emotional moment", as Ida, a depiction of the Holocaust, wins the best film prize at London Film Festival.</description>

      <body>Hammer horror star Sir Christopher Lee said it was a "very emotional moment" when he received his British Institute Fellowship from his friend Johnny Depp. He tearfully accepted the award at the London Film Festival, saying: "I didn't know you were going to be here. I must try and pull myself together." The prize for best film went to to Pawel Pawlikowski's Ida, about German occupation of Poland and the Holocaust. Screenwriter Jonathan Asser won best British newcomer. He took the accolade for his debut feature Starred Up, about the practice of placing violent young offenders prematurely in adult prison. BFI fellow and film critic Philip French said of Ida that the jury was "deeply moved by a courageous film that handles, with subtlety and insight, a painfully controversial historical situation". Sir Christopher, 91, who described receiving his award as "a great joy", is famed for his villainous portrayals of Bond bad guy Scaramanga and evil wizard Saruman in The Lord of the Rings. He has amassed more than 250 screen credits, including The Wicker Man, The Man with the Golden Gun and more recently, several Tim Burton films including Sleepy Hollow, which starred Depp. He also played Count Dooku in the Star Wars prequels. Depp, who sneaked into the awards ceremony to surprise his friend, said it was his "great honour" to present the award to "a very great man", saying he had been "fascinated and inspired" by him. "He's been a wonderful individual and over the years I've had the pleasure of working with him and it has been a childhood dream come true," he said. "But as great as it is to work with him, that pleasure doesn't compare with getting to know him and being able to count him as a true friend. "A national treasure and a genuine artist. I love ya!" Sir Christopher responded by saying: "I can't thank you enough," in reference to Depp, who he had been told could not make the occasion as he was elsewhere. He went on : "When I take a look back, and it's a long one, 67 years, at the characters I've played I get a truly strange feeling they were all played by somebody else, and not by me. "And there are a few occasions when it has been the case I wish it had!" He said of Depp: "He means an enormous amount to me. He is one of very few young actors on screen today who's truly a star. "Everything he does has a meaning. He's a joy to work with, an actor's dream and certainly a director's dream. I could go on a long time but I'd probably embarrass him." The festival presented the Sutherland Award, for the most original and imaginative film debut, to Anthony Chen, who directed Ilo Ilo, which explores the life and vulnerabilities of a modern affluent family in Singapore. The Grierson award for the best documentary went to Paul-Julien Robert's My Fathers, My Mother and Me, a portrayal of life in Friedrichshof, the largest commune in Europe, which was founded in the 70s. The film reveals the devastating emotional effects of life there on its residents, and jury president Kate Ogborn said the "disturbing film" raised "larger questions of power, parental responsibility and abuse". The film festival closes later with the world premiere of Saving Mr Banks, a dramatisation of the making of 1964 movie Mary Poppins starring Emma Thompson as author PL Travers and Tom Hanks as Walt Disney. Hanks appeared at Bafta's London headquarters on Saturday to give a Life in Pictures talk, during which he revealed some of the difficulties he faced playing "Uncle Walt" on screen. "Walt Disney died of lung cancer; he smoked three packs a day," the two-time Oscar winner told host Francine Stock. "But can we show him smoking in a major motion picture these days? No way in hell. "It's this thing that has happened in movies - real people can't smoke. We literally had a negotiation over whether I could hold a lit cigarette in a scene." In a wide-ranging discussion covering his 30-year film career, Hanks said his success was partly down to his not having "a bigger-than-life persona". "I'm charming as hell, but I don't strike fear and I don't have a huge amount of mystery," he explained. "You're not worried about me killing you, or stealing your daughter, or being some sort of criminal mastermind. "I view myself as a guy that if I had been a good student, I could be a historian," he continued. "And if I had been good at science, I could be a doctor. "I'm not good at any of those things so I'm an actor. These movies, these roles, they're always something that - if I was a little more accomplished - I could be that guy." Hanks can currently be seen in cinemas in Captain Phillips, which opened the London Film Festival on 9 October. Saving Mr Banks is out in the UK on 29 November. </body>

      <body>Some 6,000 history buffs in period military costume are re-enacting one of Germany's bloodiest battles, the Battle of the Nations. French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte was defeated near Leipzig in October 1813 by forces from Russia, Austria, Prussia and Sweden. Tens of thousands of spectators are attending the reconstruction, described as a "reconciliation". However, Church leaders object to the battle being turned into a game. They see Sunday's event as tantamount to glorifying the carnage of war, the BBC's Damien McGuinness reports. An ecumenical service was held in the town of Roetha on Saturday to mark the 200th anniversary of the event - also known as the Battle of Leipzig. The night before, European Parliament President Martin Schulz gave a speech at a memorial to the battle warning of a resurgence of nationalism. An estimated 600,000 soldiers took part in the series of battles from 16-19 October 1813 and almost 100,000 of them lost their lives. The victory of the allies - including a small British contingent - over Napoleon marked the end of his control of German territory. Organisers say their controversial re-enactment is intended to be peaceful and to bring history alive. Many of the thousands taking part have grown period-style moustaches to match their 19th Century replica uniforms. The role of Napoleon is being played by a 46-year-old Parisian lawyer, Frank Samson, who taught himself the Corsican language in an attempt to give a more authentic performance as the French emperor. Local TV is reporting live from the scene as if the battle is actually being fought today. </body>

      <body>Jorge Lorenzo's MotoGP world title hopes remain alive after he won a dramatic Australian Grand Prix which saw championship leader Marc Marquez disqualified. Yamaha's Lorenzo, who started from pole and led throughout, now trails his fellow Spaniard by 18 points going into next week's penultimate race in Japan. Riders had to change bikes mid-race because of safety concerns over tyres. But Marquez failed to pit by the required time and scored no points. After the race, BBC Sport's MotoGP presenter Matt Roberts tweeted  that Marquez's Honda team had said it was a pit-board error which led to their rider being disqualified. Dani Pedrosa was second while Valentino Rossi held off the challenge of Britain's Cal Crutchlow for third. Lorenzo described the race as "crazy" because of the compulsory bike change but his maximum return of 25 points, coupled with Marquez failing to register, means the title race has been opened up. "We were lucky," said Lorenzo. "Without the mistake from Marc I think he would have been first or second - now the championship has changed so much. "Before the race we had no chance - a 2% or 3% chance - and now it's 20% or 30%. "Let's see what happens in Motegi." [the venue for next Sunday's race in Japan] After setting the fastest time in qualifying, Lorenzo started well from pole and held off Marquez and Pedrosa in the opening lap before looking very comfortable. Tyre supplier Bridgestone said before the race that they were unable to guarantee the safety of their rear slick tyres beyond 10 laps because of the newly-resurfaced track at Phillip Island. As a result, it was decided to shorten the race to 19 laps from 27, with a mid-race pit stop. Pedrosa was the first of the top three to pit on lap nine, while Lorenzo made his change on the following lap. However, Marquez stayed out on the track until lap 11 and when he rejoined the race he had a minor clash with Lorenzo for top spot but the race leader retained his advantage. Marquez's hopes of securing the title in his rookie season then suffered a blow when he was shown the black flag for exceeding the maximum number of laps permitted before having to pit. Result 1. Jorge Lorenzo (Spain) Yamaha 29 minutes 07.155 seconds 2. Dani Pedrosa (Spain) Honda +6.936 secs 3. Valentino Rossi (Italy) Yamaha +12.344 4. Cal Crutchlow (Britain) Yamaha +12.460 5.

      <body>England lock Courtney Lawes impressed as Northampton beat Ospreys to go second in Pool One of the Heineken Cup. A Samu Manoa try and Stephen Myler conversion and penalty gave Northampton the lead before Dan Biggar landed two penalties for the visitors. Christian Day's converted try made it 17-6 at the break, only for Ospreys to hit back through a try, conversion and penalty from Biggar. But Ben Foden added a third Northampton try and Myler's boot saw Saints home. The hosts will be frustrated not to have secured a bonus point for scoring four tries, with George Pisi held a couple of feet short from a last-gasp Northampton attack, but in the end they were convincing winners. Lawes, along with fellow England forwards Dylan Hartley and Tom Wood, was outstanding in all facets of the game, although the lock's work at the line-out and in the tackle - he made 20 - was particularly noteworthy. And the 6ft 7in second row set the tone from the first whistle as he drilled Tom Habberfield backwards when the Ospreys scrum-half caught the kick-off. George North then hammered into midfield and an Ospreys offside gave Myler the chance to kick the hosts into the lead. When Manoa picked up from the base of a five-metre scrum and went over untouched, with Myler converting, with less than 15 minutes played it seemed as though Northampton were set for an easy win. But Ospreys, who went into the game on the back of a disappointing home defeat by Leinster, were determined to put up a fight and two Biggar penalties cut the gap to four points. However, Northampton were looking by far the more threatening side and they added to their lead almost immediately. Luther Burrell made a couple of big carries into midfield before the hosts went wide and Lawes - who had started things with a soaring line-out take - sent second row partner Day over in the corner for a converted score. It was turning into a spectacular game, with Northampton fizzing the ball about at pace but unable to finish things off, and the visitors prepared to counter-attack whenever they were presented with the opportunity. They turned round 17-6 down, needing to score next if the match was not to run away from them, and they duly lifted their game after the restart. Captain Alun Wyn Jones was at the heart of their charge and after he was held inches short, Biggar wriggled his way over by the posts before adding the conversion. Suddenly there were only four points in it and Northampton's cause was not helped as Myler missed a simple penalty, but approaching the hour mark they stretched clear again. The Saints pack bullied their way to within inches of the line from a line-out drive before Lee Dickson sent full-back Foden over unopposed. Myler converted from out wide and an exchange of penalties by the two fly-halves concluded the scoring, with a potentially important fourth try for Saints proving elusive. Northampton: Foden; Elliott, G Pisi, Burrell, North; Myler, L Dickson; A Waller, Hartley, Ma'afu, Lawes, Day, Dowson, Wood, Manoa. Replacements: K Pisi for Elliott (75), Fotuali'i for L.

      <title>Ferguson exit not to blame - Moyes</title>

      <body>Manchester United boss David Moyes has rejected claims that the Premier League champions have lost their fear factor since he succeeded Sir Alex Ferguson. United are eight points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal after being held to a 1-1 draw by Southampton at Old Trafford on Saturday. "Sir Alex Ferguson has a great history and his experience will always work in charge of any team," said Moyes. "But the fear comes from the team on the pitch." United have only one victory from four league games at Old Trafford since Ferguson's retirement, but Moyes insisted: "The players have always been the people that have to turn out and do it." Ferguson, who won 38 trophies during 26 years in charge, watched from the stands in his new role as a club director, but United could not build on their win at Sunderland last time out. Moyes had looked on course to record back-to-back league victories for the first time as United boss, only for Adam Lallana's late goal to cancel out Robin van Persie's first-half strike. "I am disappointed because we wanted to get a bit of momentum going and we weren't able to do that," said Moyes. "We had the opportunities to get the game finished off. I am disappointed to lose a goal so late on. "While it was 1-0, there was always the chance that Southampton might get something. I thought we had just about seen it out, then they got the corner late on. "We didn't do well enough [from the corner]. We will work on it and make sure we do it. We have got to do better in the final bit as well, the set piece, defend it and be harder to score against than we were." United are eighth with 11 points from eight games - the same tally as newly-promoted Hull. It is United's worst start to a league campaign for 24 years. Midfielder Michael Carrick said: "It is not easy reading now. Looking at the table as it is now is not something we are used to. "It is frustrating because things are not going the way we want. But as players we have to stand up, take responsibility and get better. "We are still confident. Everything is in place but for some reason, at the moment, we are not quite clicking and not quite firing." </body>

      <body>Rory McIlroy claimed a share of second place at the Korea Open after a 67 in Sunday's final round The Northern Irishman, who had fallen 10 shots behind the lead after three rounds, carded five birdies in his four-under-par round to end one behind winner Kang Sung-hoon. The only blemish for world number six McIlroy was a bogey at the 16th. McIlroy, the star attraction at the OneAsia Tour event, said: "I could have shot anything, absolutely anything." It was a strong finish after what had been a frustrating third day for the two-time major winner at the Woo Jeong Hills Country Club course near Cheonan. "I only missed two greens and had so many chances, but it was like the story of yesterday - I just didn't hole enough putts," added McIlroy. "I created so many more chances today that it could have been 61, 62. It just wasn't to be. "I didn't birdie any of the par fives, which was disappointing. "I felt like it could have been so much lower the last couple of days." McIlroy was three off the pace when he completed his round but the capitulation of overnight leader Kim Hyung-tae may have exacerbated his sense of frustration. Kim had begun the final round with a four-stroke lead but shot a six-over 77 to finish alongside McIlroy on three under. Three other Koreans, Lee Sang-hee, Lee Chang-woo and Joong-kyung, also finished on three-under 281. Kang won the title after coming home in 32, finishing a crucial birdie at the last. </body>

      <body>The 14th Rugby League World Cup begins on 26 October with England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland aiming to end 38 years of southern hemisphere dominance. The 14-team tournament sees 28 matches taking place across England, Wales, Ireland and France. England, where the bulk of the games are being played, begin proceedings when they host Australia in the double-headed opener at Cardiff on Saturday. Steve McNamara's men are only third favourites - behind overwhelming front-runners Australia and holders New Zealand - to be crowned world champions at Manchester's Old Trafford stadium on 30 November. Scotland, Wales and Ireland are considered rank outsiders to become the first northern hemisphere winners since a unified Great Britain team triumphed in the 1972 edition. The World Cup is viewed as the latest event in the UK's 'golden decade of sport', which centred around London 2012 and also includes the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games and the 2015 Rugby Union World Cup. Domestic governing body the Rugby Football League  hopes the tournament can capitalise on the success of last year's Olympic and Paralympic Games and boost the profile of the sport, helping it to expand beyond its traditional Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cumbrian heartlands. "The World Cup is a wonderful opportunity to reach out to new audiences who want to be involved in the next major international sporting event after London 2012," said Rugby League World Cup tournament director Nigel Wood. "Ticket sales have been very encouraging, with strong buying patterns from people who have never previously bought tickets for rugby league events." Here, BBC Sport tells you everything you need to know about the competition's teams, format, venues and history. With an ever-changing format, long gaps between tournaments and on-field mismatches, the Rugby League World Cup has not been easy for supporters, new and old, to follow. But the last edition, hosted by Australia in 2008, proved to be a resounding success, drawing large crowds and an impressive worldwide television audience. It prompted the Rugby League International Federation  to approve a proposal to expand from 10 to 14 teams for this year's tournament. Pool A and Pool B are each comprised of four teams, including Australia and England in the former and New Zealand in the latter, and the top three sides from those groups will progress to the quarter-finals. There are only three teams in each of Pool C and Pool D, which means the sides play each other and then one nation from the opposite group. Only the group winners earn a place in the last eight. "The idea is that we don't have any of the blow-outs that you see in other World Cups," said communications manager Martin Johnson. "So every team will go into the group stages thinking they have a chance of winning their group, although that will be a bit harder in the elite groups. "But every team in groups C and D has a chance of winning a game and no team should go home without scoring a few tries - and that's better for the supporters and better for the development of the game." Former England skipper Jamie Peacock, who is part of BBC Sport's commentary team for the World Cup and will have a weekly column on the website, played almost 50 times for England and Great Britain before retiring from international duty in June 2012. The Leeds Rhinos prop, 35, analyses the chances of each of the home nations, Australia and New Zealand. Coach: Tim Sheens Captain: Cameron Smith Star man: Johnathan Thurston (half-back) Appearances: 13 Best: Champions (1957, 1968, 1970, 1975, 1977, 1988, 1992, 1995, 2000) Jamie Peacock's view: "Australia are the overwhelming favourites - but they are beatable. New Zealand have proved that in big games, including the 2008 World Cup final. "The Aussies are very effective at international level and it is a big help that their four key players - Johnathan Thurston, Cooper Cronk, Cameron Smith and Billy Slater - play together for Queensland in the State of Origin. That's another high-pressure situation. "Australia have the biggest pool of players to pick from so it is no surprise that they are the favourites." Australia's World Cup squad Coach: Steve McNamara Captain: Kevin Sinfield Star man: Sam Burgess (prop forward) Appearances: Four (plus nine as Great Britain) Best: Runner-up (1975, 1995) * Great Britain were three-time champions (1954, 1960, 1972) Jamie Peacock's view: "They have a great chance of winning the tournament, especially with home advantage. That's a big bonus. Look at the Olympics, some of the performances from the British athletes rose to levels that they didn't know they could reach. "All the main players are fully fit and Steve McNamara has managed to break down the barriers of the club rivalries which exist between the players on a weekly basis in the Super League. This is something that others haven't been able to do in the past. "And they have got Sam Burgess, who is the best forward in the world. That's because he can play prop, second row or loose forward as well as anyone else in the world." England's World Cup squad Coach: Stephen Kearney Captain: Simon Mannering Star man: Sonny Bill Williams (second row) Appearances: 13 Best: Champions (2008) Jamie Peacock's view: "Defending champions New Zealand have got every chance of upsetting the odds again and repeating their 2008 success. "They have a lot of players who not only start regularly in the NRL, but are key players for their sides. "The All Blacks have lost their last five Tests against the Aussies but have managed to beat them in the big games like the 2008 World Cup and Four Nations. "Sonny Bill Williams being available is huge for New Zealand and the tournament. He's just helped Sydney Roosters win the NRL and he lit up the competition. "Everyone wants to see the star players at the World Cup and Sonny Bill is a name that transcends sports because of his spells in rugby union and boxing." New Zealand's World Cup squad Coach: Steve McCormack Captain: Danny Brough Star man: Danny Brough (half-back) Appearances: Two (plus nine as Great Britain) Best: One win (2008) Jamie Peacock's view: "Undoubtedly, the Super League's 2013 Man of Steel Danny Brough is going to the main man for Scotland. He will dictate everything they do - it will all run through him. "The other players will look up to Brough. He is the Huddersfield captain and showed his leadership skills as they won the Super League Leaders' Shield. He will have to do that - and more - for Scotland." Scotland's World Cup squad Coach: Iestyn Harris Captain: Craig Kopczak Star men: Ben Flower (Prop) and Craig Kopczak (Prop) Appearances: Three (plus nine as Great Britain) Best: Semi-finalists (1995, 2000) Jamie Peacock's view: "Wales are growing as a force every year under Iestyn Harris. He has got a good squad together, with plenty of young players. "For them, this World Cup is all about gaining experience as a team. They are not going to win it but they can have a great time and possibly cause an upset. "They have got two very good props in Ben Flowers and Craig Kopczak, who both would be picked in a combined Great Britain squad if there was one." Wales' World Cup squad Coach: Mark Aston Captain: Liam Finn Star man: Pat Richards (Wing) Appearances: Two (plus nine as Great Britain) Best: Quarter-finalists (2000, 2008) Jamie Peacock's view: "Ireland are in the same group as England and Australia and I doubt they are capable of upsetting those two. But they will be hoping to give them a close game. "It is clear that the other teams in the group, including Fiji, are much stronger, but Ireland will look at this World Cup as an opportunity to give rugby league a huge lift in their country. "Pat Richards is a massive player for them. He has been one of the top three overseas players the Super League has ever had. He's a magnificent player, a great goalkicker and also a wonderful leader." Ireland's World Cup squad Although the tournament is split across four nations, England is the primary host with 20 of the 28 matches taking place across the country. Games are being played in 20 host towns and cities and include London, Cardiff, Limerick and Avignon alongside several venues in the traditional Yorkshire and Lancashire heartlands of the sport. Wembley Stadium hosts both semi-finals in a special double-header, while the final will be staged at Old Trafford in Manchester. Hull is the only place to hold matches at two different venues - the KC Stadium and Craven Park. But the tournament begins in Wales, where England meet Australia at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on 26 October. As well as the opening fixture, Wales also stages matches at the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham and Neath's The Gnoll. France play two of their group matches on home soil in Avignon and Perpignan, while Ireland play Australia in Limerick. "If you look at the 2000 World Cup [which was staged across the UK, Ireland and France] it was a struggle. We went to a lot of football grounds and that wasn't very successful," added Johnson. "So we've looked at it very closely this time and we think we've got the blend just right. The big games are in big places: the Millennium Stadium, Wembley, Old Trafford. Old Trafford does a great job for us with the Super League Grand Final being held there every year so that was a no-brainer. "A double-header at Wembley will be fantastic, and we had to have a marquee venue for the opener and you can't do better than Cardiff. After that we go to the heartlands, areas where we know our fans will come out. "But we're also going to areas where the game is developing, places like Bristol, Limerick and the two games in France. So it's a really good spread for everybody." Australia have dominated the competition since its inception in 1954, winning nine of the 13 tournaments, and begin as overwhelming favourites to regain the title this year. France were the driving force behind the World Cup's creation and hosted the inaugural four-team event, which also included Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain. But they were defeated in the final by Great Britain in front of an expectant Parisian crowd. The next five World Cups, which took place in 1957, 1960, 1968, 1970 and 1972, featured the same four nations. Australia and Great Britain dominated - winning three times and twice respectively - within varied formats. The original trophy - which will be the one presented to the tournament winners - was stolen during the 1970 competition while on public display at Bradford's Midland Hotel and was not found again until 1990. The competition was revamped in 1975, becoming a five-team tournament with Great Britain splitting into England and Wales and the action being played over eight months as part of a "World Series". It returned to the previous format in 1977 as Australia defended their crown, before another overhaul - including the addition of Papua New Guinea - saw matches stretched over three years between 1985-1988 and 1989-1992. The unstoppable Kangaroos won both, including a 10-6 victory over Great Britain in front of a World Cup record crowd of 73,361 at Wembley in 1992. In 1995, to mark the centenary of rugby league's birth, an innovative new structure was adopted. The number of teams doubled to 10, with Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and South Africa participating for the first time. Australia's continued their dominance and also added the 16-nation version in 2000, when Lebanon, Russia, Ireland, Scotland and the Cook Islands made their bows. But the Kangaroos were denied a seventh straight title when Antipodean rivals New Zealand upset the odds in 2008. The All Blacks lifted the trophy for the first time after an epic final against Australia in Brisbane. </body>

      <title>JP Morgan 'faces record $13bn fine'</title>
      <description>US banking giant JP Morgan is set for a record $13bn (£8bn) fine to settle investigations into its mortgage-backed securities, US media reports say.</description>

      <body>US banking giant JP Morgan is set for a record $13bn (£8bn) fine to settle investigations into its mortgage-backed securities, US media reports have said. A tentative deal is believed to have been reached in talks with senior US Justice Department officials. The fine relates to the sale of securities based on home loans, which led to the near-collapse of the banking system in 2007. If confirmed, it would be the biggest settlement ever paid by an US company. Last month, JP Morgan was fined almost $1bn in the "London Whale" scandal, which arose from huge disastrous bets on the financial markets placed by former bank employee Bruno Iksil. The tentative deal to pay the $13bn fine to the Justice Department was reached during the talks on Friday, between JP Morgan lawyers with US Attorney General Eric Holder and his deputy Tony West, the Wall Street Journal said, citing officials familiar with the decision. The New York Times also reported that the investment bank was nearing the agreement. Neither the Justice Department nor the bank was available for comment. But the reports said that while the fine would settle all civil claims, the US bank would still face possible federal criminal charges being pursued in California or individual criminal claims. The $13bn sum is said to include $9bn in fines and a further $4bn in relief for struggling homeowners. In the run-up to the financial crisis, sophisticated financial products known as mortgage-backed securities were created by many investment banks. These special bonds contained a mix of investments but at their heart were supposed to be risk-free home loans, the BBC's business correspondent Joe Lynam reports. When the housing bubble burst, the value of these assets fell sharply and the credit markets seized up. The balance sheets of many US and European banks, including those in the UK, became toxic and they had to be bailed out by their governments. What JP Morgan is alleged to have done was sell the mortgage-backed assets knowing full well that many of the home loans were in fact very risky. Some of the problems relate to mortgage bank Washington Mutual and investment bank Bear Stearns, two failing firms that JPMorgan took over in 2008. The mortgage-backed assets played a central role in the near collapse of the banking system when banks realised in 2007 that many of their assets were worth a fraction of their official book value. JP Morgan had initially aimed to persuade Justice Department officials to drop the criminal investigation but the attorney general ruled that out, reports said. The bank is not alone in facing inquiries into past practice. In August, US government officials filed two lawsuits against Bank of America relating to mortgage-backed securities. Bank of America denied civil fraud in failing to disclose risks and misleading investors. JP Morgan has found itself overwhelmed by mounting legal troubles lately. Once the darling of Washington and Wall Street, it reported a rare quarterly earnings loss last week, mostly due to legal costs totalling $9.2bn. The bank lost $380m during the quarter, compared with a profit of $5.7bn in the same period last year. JP Morgan says it has set aside a fund of $23bn to deal with mounting legal costs. </body>

      <title>Bank 'has room to raise UK rates'</title>
      <description>The Bank of England could raise interest rates a "fair amount" without hurting homeowners on the Help to Buy scheme, according to one of its policymakers.</description>

      <body>The Bank of England could raise interest rates a "fair amount" without hurting homeowners taking up the government's Help to Buy scheme, according to one of its policymakers. Ben Broadbent, who is on the committee that decides rates, was asked how rate rises would affect those new borrowers. "I think there is a fair amount they could go up before borrowers got into great difficulties," he told Sky News. But he added that a rate rise must not be allowed to "choke off" recovery. Rates would only go up if the economy was in good health - or if inflation was out of control, said Mr Broadbent. "We want to ensure that this recovery continues and is not choked off by a premature rise in interest rates," he told Sky News. Interest rates have been at a record low 0.5% since 2009. A rise in interest rates would mean an increase in mortgage payments for most homeowners, which could lead to a rise in repossessions if people were unable to afford the higher monthly payments. Under the second phase of the Help to Buy scheme, which is now in place, borrowers across the UK can put down a deposit of as little as 5% of the property price. The government provides a seven-year taxpayer guarantee to the lender covering 15% of the loan value. It is available for properties sold for up to £600,000 in the UK. There are concerns that Help to Buy may lead to another housing bubble and borrowers could get into trouble when rates do eventually rise. Mr Broadbent told Sky News that "the numbers entering this [Help to Buy] scheme are relatively low and although interest rates will, as you say, at some point start to rise, it is worth remembering quite how low a level we are starting from." Last week, the Bank's chief economist, Spencer Dale, said that economic conditions are unlikely to improve enough to merit a rise in rates next year. In a QandA on Twitter, Mr Dale said: "Rates will only rise when had sustained period of strong growth as long as no risk to stability." He was also asked how many mortgage repossessions there'll be when interest rates return to long-term average. "Don't know," he replied. "But when we raise interest rates economy should be stronger, higher employment, higher real wages." Mr Dale and Mr Broadbent are two of the nine people at the Bank who set monetary policy. In its last minutes, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it would make no change to the £375bn of monetary stimulus it is providing through its quantitative easing (QE) programme. The programme, brought in to give an extra stimulus because interest rates could barely be cut below the current 0.5%, has been criticised by some for helping the financial markets and the banks, by making money cheap, rather than the economy as a whole. </body>

      <title>GP exam 'unfair to minorities'</title>
      <description>British ethnic minority doctors are four times more likely than white candidates to fail their clinical GP exam, an investigation commissioned by the General Medical Council finds.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24572522</url>

      <body>UK ethnic minority doctors are four times more likely than white candidates to fail their clinical GP exam, the General Medical Council has found. The review into 5,000 candidates was ordered after ethnic minority students complained the exam was unfair. Prof Aneez Esmail, an expert on racism in the NHS who led the investigation, said "unconscious bias" could explain the findings. But the Royal College of GPs, which sets the exams, denies they are unfair. RCGP chairwoman Dr Clare Gerada said the college took equality and diversity issues "extremely seriously". She added that the college: "strongly refutes any allegations that the exam is discriminatory in any way". The Clinical Skills Assessment (CSA) - introduced in 2010 - is a practical test in which trainee GPs are assessed by an examiner while they treat actors in a mock-surgery setting. They have up to four attempts to take the test which they must pass before they can practise as a GP. During the six-month review for the GMC, Prof Esmail analysed data on more than 5,000 candidates who sat the CSA exam over a two-year period. He said he could not exclude racial discrimination as the cause of the findings. He told BBC One's Breakfast: "Many of us who do work in this area describe the problem of unconscious bias. "So I think that what might be happening, especially with the white British graduates compared to the ethnic minority British graduates, is that - without realising it even perhaps - they may be assessing it in a different way." "So I don't think that it's the examiners saying 'oh we don't like ethnic minorities' - it doesn't work like that anymore," he added. "It's all this unconscious stuff that goes on which we need to be aware of." He said all British doctors, whether white or from ethnic minorities, had "gone through medical school and passed all that and so we're not talking about people who aren't as good as - they're exactly the same". He said the test was "a relatively new technique that's being used and it's bound to improve as time goes on". He has made a number of recommendations to try to combat bias in the exam including having more examiners and actors who are from ethnic minority backgrounds. But the RGCP's Dr Clare Gerada said the review found "no evidence, either through the examiners or through the actors, or through the process of the examination, of discrimination". She added that, "in fact, what it showed was that it was probably preparedness for the exam that was a factor". "We already take comprehensive steps to ensure that the exam is fair and equitable to all candidates," she told BBC News. "This exam is designed for doctors to practise independently; it is not an exam that has to be passed by everyone. I think that is a very important issue. "Of course we cannot be complacent and we continue to make sure the exam does not have bias built in." The review also found that trainee GPs from abroad were 14 times more likely to fail the CSA exam than white British doctors. "We also know that eventually they pass," Dr Gerada said. "We also know that this is a culturally specific exam - it stands to reason if you are born and brought up in this country, within the NHS, that you have an advantage," she added. "If I go to India and sit an exam designed for doctors to practise in India, I will be at a disadvantage." GP Una Coales, meanwhile, said that, "because they use predominantly white actors, even the white actors may not even be aware that they have hidden bias against foreigners". "So if they hear an Indian dialect, for instance, they might pretend that they don't understand them and they might subconsciously withhold vital clues," she said. She said the actors could "give away the agenda or the concern right away if he happens to like you or can withhold it for eight minutes of a 10-minute exam". Organisations representing ethnic minority doctors have threatened legal action against the RCGP. Dr Ramesh Mehta, president of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO), said: "Hundreds of doctors' careers have been damaged because they have repeatedly failed the CSA exam. "They are facing institutional bias and are unfairly failing the exam despite extensive training and knowledge." BAPIO has been given permission to launch a judicial review against the RCGP and the GMC over the exam. The General Medical Council said it took the findings of the independent review seriously. "We agree with Prof Esmail that there is no room for complacency - we want to work with him and all those involved in this area," chief executive Niall Dickson said. "We are duty-bound to act where there is evidence of a problem and his report and recommendations make a powerful case for action." </body>

      <title>National teacher strike may go ahead</title>
      <description>Teaching unions say they will press ahead with plans for a one-day national strike before Christmas if the dispute is not resolved.</description>

      <body>Teaching unions say they will press ahead with a one-day national strike before Christmas if a dispute over pay, pensions and jobs is not resolved. Nearly 3,500 schools were closed or partially closed on Thursday in London, Cumbria, and the South East, North East and South West of England. This was the third in a rolling campaign of regional walk-outs. A national strike would include Wales, as teachers' pay and conditions are determined by Westminster. Teachers are angry about the introduction of performance related pay and changes which mean they will have to work until they are at least 65 to be eligible for a full pension, rising to 68 for those born after 1978, say the unions. They also complain of excessive workloads, changes to their working conditions and job cuts. Teachers in the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber region walked out on 1 October. This followed a strike across the North West on 27 June. So far Wales has not been affected by the strikes. Teachers in Northern Ireland and Scotland deal with their devolved governments on pay and conditions and so will remain unaffected by this dispute. The NASUWT says it is considering its next steps but it is likely that the planned one-day national strike will go ahead if the government does not address its concerns. The union's general secretary Chris Keates said: "The rolling programme of strike action has commanded support from the overwhelming majority of teachers. "The Secretary of State can no longer claim that the majority of teachers support his reforms. Teachers' anger and frustration is much in evidence and he now needs to begin to seriously address their concerns. "The NASUWT National Action Committee is keeping matters under review." The government restated its disappointment that the unions were striking over measures to allow head teachers to pay good teachers more. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said only around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed on Thursday, compared with 60% who walked out in the national strikes of November 2011. The government says that it has met the unions frequently to discuss their concerns and will continue to do so. </body>

      <title>Major piracy site to be shut down</title>
      <description>IsoHunt, a major website that indexed illegal files, is to close and pay $110m (£68m) to a US movie industry body.</description>

      <body>IsoHunt, a popular website offering BitTorrents of mostly pirated material, is to shut down following a court settlement. The site's owner, Canadian Gary Fung, has agreed to pay $110m (£68m) to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). MPAA chairman Chris Dodd said the move was a "major step forward" for legitimate commerce online. In a blog post, Mr Fung said: "It's sad to see my baby go." The site is currently still online, but will soon be shut. It is one of the most popular sites of its kind on the internet. A group of companies, including Disney, Paramount and Twentieth Century Fox, accused the site of wilfully infringing copyright by listing millions of popular movies and TV programmes - in a court battle that has lasted for more than seven years. Now Mr Fung has agreed to settle. He added: "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race and I have remained faithful. 10.5 years of IsoHunt has been a long journey by any business definition and forever in internet start-up time. "It started as a programming hobby in my university days that has become so, so much more." Court documents acknowledged that it is unlikely that Mr Fung's company could pay $110m, and that the MPAA would probably receive between $2m and $4m. Like a similar site, The Pirate Bay, that has been blocked in the UK by a court order, IsoHunt did not host pirated material itself. It instead acted as a directory of sources from which to download illegal files. According to court documents, Mr Fung's defence hinged on this degree of separation - and argued that it was the users of IsoHunt responsible for distributing pirated material, not IsoHunt. The Californian court disagreed. "It sends a strong message that those who build businesses around encouraging, enabling, and helping others to commit copyright infringement are themselves infringers, and will be held accountable for their illegal actions," said MPAA chairman Mr Dodd. "The successful outcome of this landmark lawsuit will also will help preserve jobs and protect the tens of thousands of businesses in the creative industries, whose hard work and investments are exploited by sites like IsoHunt." Ahead of the ruling, Mr Fung had taken to social news site Reddit to take part in an AMAA - Ask Me Almost Anything - session. In it, he described himself as a "reluctant revolutionary", and backed calls for copyright reform. He said he did not hold a disregard for the law, and acted upon requests to remove links to pirated content when the company was made aware. He also said the industry could render sites like IsoHunt obsolete if it offered simultaneous releases worldwide, as well as digital offerings that were cheaper than physical copies. His thoughts echoed findings by a trio of researchers at George Mason University in Virginia, US. Their site piracydata.org has been collating the weekly top 10 most-pirated films and investigating whether legal digital methods were available. They found that half of the movies in the list were not available to access legally online. Furthermore, none of the 10 titles could be streamed - arguably the most straightforward way to consume media online. However, in contrast, efforts by Fox to curb piracy of TV series The Walking Dead fell flat. Despite the first episode of the latest series being made available to stream free online, the programme was still illegally downloaded more than 500,000 times, according to data gathered by Torrentfreak.com.

      <title>'Electronic blood' computer tested</title>
      <description>A new brain-inspired computing device powered via a liquid instead of through wires has been demonstrated at IBM's Zurich laboratory.</description>

      <body>IBM has unveiled a prototype of a new brain-inspired computer powered by what it calls "electronic blood". The firm says it is learning from nature by building computers fuelled and cooled by a liquid, like our minds. The human brain packs phenomenal computing power into a tiny space and uses only 20 watts of energy - an efficiency IBM is keen to match. Its new "redox flow" system pumps an electrolyte "blood" through a computer, carrying power in and taking heat out. A very basic model was demonstrated this week at the technology giant's Zurich lab by Dr Patrick Ruch and Dr Bruno Michel. Their vision is that by 2060, a one petaflop computer that would fill half a football field today, will fit on your desktop. "We want to fit a supercomputer inside a sugarcube. To do that, we need a paradigm shift in electronics - we need to be motivated by our brain," says Michel. "The human brain is 10,000 times more dense and efficient than any computer today. "That's possible because it uses only one - extremely efficient - network of capillaries and blood vessels to transport heat and energy - all at the same time." IBM's brainiest computer to date is Watson, which famously trounced two champions of the US TV quiz show Jeopardy. The victory was hailed as a landmark for cognitive computing - machine had surpassed man. But the contest was unfair, says Michel. The brains of Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter ran on only 20 watts of energy, whereas Watson needed 85,000 watts. Energy efficiency - not raw computing power - is the guiding principle for the next generation of computer chips, IBM believes. Our current 2D silicon chips, which for half a century have doubled in power through Moore's Law, are approaching a physical limit where they cannot shrink further without overheating. "The computer industry uses $30bn of energy and throws it out of the window. We're creating hot air for $30bn," says Michel. "Ninety-nine per cent of a computer's volume is devoted to cooling and powering. Only 1% is used to process information. And we think we've built a good computer?" "The brain uses 40% of its volume for functional performance - and only 10% for energy and cooling." Michel's vision is for a new "bionic" computing architecture, inspired by one of the laws of nature - allometric scaling - where an animal's metabolic power increases with its body size. An elephant, for example, weighs as much as a million mice. But it consumes 30 times less energy, and can perform a task even a million mice cannot accomplish. The same principle holds true in computing, says Michel, whose bionic vision has three core design features. The first is 3D architecture, with chips stacked high, and memory storage units interwoven with processors. "It's the difference between a low-rise building, where everything is spread out flat, and a high rise building. You shorten the connection distances," says Matthias Kaiserswerth, director of IBM Zurich. But there is a very good reason today's chips are gridiron pancakes - exposure to the air is critical to dissipate the intense heat generated by ever-smaller transistors. Piling chips on top of one another locks this heat inside - a major roadblock to 3D computing. IBM's solution is integrated liquid cooling - where chips are interlayered with tiny water pipes. The art of liquid cooling has been demonstrated by Aquasar and put to work inside the German supercomputer SuperMUC which - perversely - harnesses warm water to cool its circuits. SuperMUC consumes 40% less electricity as a result. But for IBM to truly match the marvels of the brain, there is a third evolutionary step it must achieve - simultaneous liquid fuelling and cooling. Just as blood gives sugar in one hand and takes heat with another, IBM is looking for a fluid that can multitask. Vanadium is the best performer in their current laboratory test system - a type of redox flow unit - similar to a simple battery. First a liquid - the electrolyte - is charged via electrodes, then pumped into the computer, where it discharges energy to the chip. Redox flow is far from a new technology, and neither is it especially complex. But IBM is the first to stake its chips on this "electronic blood" as the food of future computers - and will attempt to optimise it over the coming decades to achieve zettascale computing. "To power a zettascale computer today would take more electricity than is produced in the entire world," says Michel. He is confident that the design hurdles in his bionic model can be surmounted - not least that a whole additional unit is needed to charge the liquid. And while other labs are betting on spintronics, quantum computing, or photonics to take us beyond silicon, the Zurich team believes the real answer lies right behind our eyes. "Just as computers help us understand our brains, if we understand our brains we'll make better computers," says director Matthias Kaiserswerth. He would like to see a future Watson win Jeopardy on a level playing field. Other experts in computing agree that IBM's 3D principles are sound. But as to whether bionic computing will be the breakthrough technology, the jury is out. "The idea of using a fluid to both power and cool strikes me as very novel engineering - killing two birds with one stone," says Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey's computing department. "But every form of future computing has its champions - whether it be quantum computing, DNA computing or neuromorphic computing. "There is a long way to go from the lab to having one of these sitting under your desk." Prof Steve Furber, leader of the SpiNNaker project agrees that "going into the third dimension" has more to offer than continually shrinking transistors. "The big issue with 3D computing is getting the heat out - and liquid cooling could be very effective if integrated into 3D systems as proposed here," he told the BBC. "But all of the above will not get electronics down to the energy-efficiency of the brain. "That will require many more changes, including a move to analogue computation instead of digital. "It will also involve breakthroughs in new non-Turing models of computation, for example based on an understanding of how the brain processes information." </body>

      <body>A new stage musical by the writer of Calendar Girls has won two prizes at the UK Theatre Awards, which reward the best of British regional theatre. This Is My Family by Tim Firth, which opened at the Sheffield Crucible in June, was named best musical. The cast included Sian Phillips, who won best supporting performance. Other winners included actress Cush Jumbo, who won best performance in a play for her role as Nora in A Doll's House at Manchester's Royal Exchange. Janie Dee, who starred in Hello, Dolly! at the Leicester Curve, picked up the award for best performance in a musical. Sheffield Theatres, which runs the city's Crucible and Lyceum venues, scooped a total of four awards, including the two for This Is My Family. The musical tells the story of two teenage children, a stressed mum and dad, a bawdy aunt and a forgetful grandmother, played by Phillips, who end up on a disastrous camping holiday. The songs and script were written by Firth, whose past credits include the Madness musical Our House and the Kinky Boots film script as well as the Calendar Girls movie. The other winning Sheffield productions were a stage version of the hit film The Full Monty, which won best touring production, and Mike Bartlett's drama Bull, which was named best new play. In other categories, the award for best children's show was shared between The Borrowers at Northern Stage in Newcastle and Mister Holgado by Unicorn Theatre in London. Blanche McIntyre was named best director for her take on Chekhov's The Seagull, while the prize for best design went to Jonathan Fensom and Charles Balfour for World War I story The Accrington Pals at the Royal Exchange. Wendy Houstoun was awarded the prize for achievement in dance for her "insightful, funny" solo show 50 Acts, while the achievement in opera award went to Welsh National Opera Lulu and Lohengrin. Actor Simon Callow received The Stage award for outstanding contribution to British theatre at the ceremony at the London Guildhall. Professional productions across the UK were eligible, with the exception of West End shows and National Theatre and Royal Shakespeare Company productions in London. The accolade for most welcoming theatre, which was decided by a public vote, went to Exeter's 60-seat Bike Shed Theatre. The winner was chosen by dividing the number of votes for each theatre by its capacity. </body>

      <title>Where the penalty for miscarriage is jail</title>

      <body>El Salvador has one of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the world. A side-effect is that women who suffer miscarriages are sometimes suspected of inducing an abortion - and can even be jailed for murder. Glenda Xiomara Cruz was crippled by abdominal pain and heavy bleeding in the early hours of 30 October 2012. The 19-year-old from Puerto El Triunfo, eastern El Salvador, went to the nearest public hospital where doctors said she had lost her baby. It was the first she knew about the pregnancy as her menstrual cycle was unbroken, her weight practically unchanged, and a pregnancy test in May 2012 had been negative. Four days later she was charged with aggravated murder - intentionally murdering the 38-to-42 week foetus - at a court hearing she was too sick to attend. The hospital had reported her to the police for a suspected abortion. After two emergency operations and three weeks in hospital she was moved to Ilopango women's prison on the outskirts of the capital San Salvador. Then last month she was sentenced to 10 years in jail, the judge ruling that she should have saved the baby's life. Her lawyer, Dennis Munoz Estanley, says the legal system has an inbuilt "presumption of guilt" making it hard for women to prove their innocence. "She is yet another innocent victim of our unjust and discriminatory legal system which jails poor, young women who suffer obstetric complications for murder on the most flimsy evidence," he says. Xiomara's father describes the conviction as a "terrible injustice". He testified in court that his daughter had endured years of domestic violence at the hands of her partner. And yet the prosecution - which sought a 50-year jail term - relied heavily on this man's allegation that she had intentionally killed the foetus. Xiomara has not seen her four-year-old daughter since the miscarriage. El Salvador is one of five countries with a total ban on abortion, along with Nicaragua, Chile, Honduras and Dominican Republic. Since 1998, the law has allowed no exceptions - even if a woman is raped, her life is at risk or the foetus is severely deformed. More than 200 women were reported to the police between 2000 and 2011, of whom 129 were prosecuted and 49 convicted - 26 for murder (with sentences of 12 to 35 years) and 23 for abortion, according to research by Citizens' Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion. Seven more have been convicted since 2012. The study underlines that these women are overwhelmingly poor, unmarried and poorly educated - and they are usually denounced by public hospital staff. Not a single criminal case originated from the private health sector where thousands of abortions are believed to take place annually. Munoz has worked with 29 of the incarcerated women, helping secure the early release of eight. "Only one intentionally induced an abortion, the other 28 suffered natural obstetric complications but were jailed for murder without any direct evidence," he says. Last year when Maria Teresa Rivera suffered a miscarriage, she was sentenced to 40 years in jail for aggravated murder. Like Xiomara, Teresa, 28, had no pregnancy symptoms before sudden severe pain and bleeding, and was reported to police by the public hospital where she had sought emergency help. The scientific evidence was flimsy, according to Munoz who will soon lodge an appeal, and the prosecution relied heavily on a colleague of hers, who testified that Rivera had said she "might be" pregnant a full 11 months before the miscarriage. A textile factory worker, she was the family's only breadwinner and her eight-year-old son is now living in dire poverty with his grandmother. Cristina Quintanilla's story is different. On 24 October 2004, the 18-year-old from rural San Miguel was seven months pregnant with her second child, living with her mother in the capital to be near a hospital for the birth. Her boyfriend was working in the US, but the couple were excited buying baby clothes and saving food tokens. "Around midnight I felt an immense pain, I thought I was dying," Quintanilla says. "I was banging on the bathroom door to get my mum's attention when I felt the baby drop out. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital." Her mother called the police - a typical step for Salvadorans in an emergency, who took them to hospital. Quintanilla was given an anaesthetic, and interrogated when she came round. Then she was handcuffed to the hospital bed, charged with manslaughter and transferred to a police cell. The first judge dismissed the case, but the prosecution appealed, upgrading the charge to aggravated murder. Quintanilla was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in jail, where she was vilified as a child killer. Her son Daniel, then only four, spent four years living with his great-grandmother until Munoz succeeded in having the sentence reduced to three years. "The medical reports couldn't explain why the baby died, but the prosecutor made me out to be a criminal who could have saved my baby even though I had passed out in pain," she says. "I will never understand why they did this to me, I lost four years of my life and still don't know why I lost my baby." Morena Herrera from Citizens' Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion says these cases have had a chilling effect, with many pregnant poor women who suffer miscarriages or complications during pregnancy "too afraid to seek medical help". "I would be terrified to go a public hospital as there is no benefit of doubt given to young women, we are presumed guilty and jailed," says Bessy Ramirez, 27, from San Salvador. "We cannot even rely on health staff to put their prejudices aside and treat us confidentially." The strict abortion law has other serious human rights implications. Suicide was the most common cause of death in 2011 among 10-to-19-year-old girls, half of whom were pregnant, according to Health Ministry figures. It was also the third most common cause of maternal mortality. Earlier this year, the plight of lupus sufferer Beatriz, 22, attracted international condemnation after the Supreme Court refused to authorise an abortion, even though her life was at risk and the foetus too deformed to be viable. Beatriz's health deteriorated while the court deliberated for several months. She gave birth at 27 weeks. The baby died within hours. Individual members of the current FMLN government, particularly Health Minister Maria Isabel Rodriguez, criticised the abortion law during the controversy over Beatriz's case. But the government has made no attempt to repeal or relax the law since coming to power in 2009, as it remains popular with large parts of the conservative population, who revere the Church and pro-life religious groups such as Si a la Vida (Yes to Life). The Arena Party, which is strongly allied with the Church, is favourite to win next year's General Election. But Esther Major, Amnesty International's El Salvador expert, describes the country's abortion law as "cruel and discriminatory". "Women and girls end up in prison for being unwilling, or simply tragically unable, to carry the pregnancy to term," she says. "It makes seeking hospital treatment for complications during pregnancy, including a miscarriage, a dangerous lottery. "It cannot be in the interests of society to criminalise women and girls in this way." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>The drugs derived from deadly poisons</title>
      <description>The deadliest poisons are often central to the most important medicines, as Michael Mosley explains.</description>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <body>The brother-in-law of a Sheffield man who drowned in the sea off Cyprus while saving a man in difficulty has spoken of the family's loss. Keith West, 50, had been holidaying on the island with his fiancee Julie Davies while the couple planned their wedding there next year. Mr West was caught in an undercurrent on 14 October after rescuing a man. His brother-in-law, Steve Robjohns, said Mr West "would not have hesitated" to help someone in danger. "Keith was an old fashioned Yorkshireman. He was brilliant, he was true, and there wasn't a bad bone in his body. "It doesn't come as a surprise to me that he's done what he's done," said Mr Robjohns. It is believed Mr West was walking along the beach with his fiancee when he saw a man in trouble in the water and tried to help, said Mr Robjohns. He managed to save the man but was then caught by a wave and pulled under the water. Mr West had been submerged for about 10 minutes before a lifeguard found him and he could not be resuscitated. Ms Davies was "badly cut up" about her partner's death, said Mr Robjohns. "She has just had him pulled away from her and she can't get to grips with the fact she's never going to see him again," he said. "It's truly awful and all our hearts and minds go out to Julie who absolutely loved him to bits. It's truly heart-rending stuff." The Foreign Office said it was aware of the death of a British national on Cyprus and was providing consular assistance to the family. </body>

      <body>More than 6,000 runners have taken part in a new marathon in York organised by the family of Jane Tomlinson. The Yorkshire Marathon was set up by Jane Tomlinson's Run For All, which the Leeds fundraiser's family launched after she died of cancer in 2007. The marathon's 26.2 mile (42km) route passed several landmarks in York and went through villages in North Yorkshire and the East Riding. Edwin Korir, from Kenya, won the men's race in two hours and 13 minutes. The race was expected to raise more than £1.3m for charities, organisers said. Mrs Tomlinson undertook a series of fundraising sporting challenges after being told her cancer was terminal in 2000. She had raised more than £1.5m by the time of her death. Jane Tomlinson's Run For All already stages Leeds, York, Hull and Pennine-Lancashire 10k races and the Leeds half marathon. An additional 600 places were made available for the inaugural Yorkshire Marathon after an initial 5,500 were snapped up within three days earlier this year by runners from all over the world. The race started and finished at the University of York, with runners passing York's city walls, the famous Betty's tea rooms and York Minster. Lynne Preston, the marathon's lead organiser, said it was "really special" for the city. "In York we have a city with amazingly spectacular scenery, but one that is also extremely flat which should make for a really fast course," she said. Double Paralympic gold medallist Hannah Cockroft, from Halifax, who took part in the event, said the marathon built on Yorkshire's showing in the 2012 Olympics. She said: "Last summer proved that Yorkshire was the best county for sport in Britain and now that Yorkshire has its very own marathon, people can come and share in the legacy that was created." </body>

      <description>Workers at the Grangemouth refinery hold a rally outside the plant amid the continuing dispute which has seen the plant go into shutdown.</description>

      <body>Workers at the Grangemouth refinery have held a rally outside the plant amid the continuing dispute which has seen the plant go into shutdown. It comes as First Minister Alex Salmond urged operators Ineos to "fire up the plant and do it now". Ineos has asked the Unite union to make a commitment to call no further industrial action this year. Unite said it would agree, but on the condition that Ineos would not impose cuts planned for the same period. Management and unions failed to reach a deal on Friday which could see operations restart. The plant was shut down last week as a result of the dispute, which came close to industrial action by the union. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme, Mr Salmond said: "I think Unite should give a no strike - without strings - guarantee. "Once that is done Ineos should fire up the plant and then the various discussions, negotiations, consultations on terms and conditions, should take place against the background of a working plant, not a plant that is lying cold." He added: "Let's get the plant up and running so that everybody has a vested interest in coming to terms in a plant that is working, as opposed to this current situation, which is wholly dangerous for the workforce and the Scottish economy, of a plant that is lying cold." Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scottish secretary, said: "Rather than demonstrating, workers want to be working to make sure that Grangemouth has a successful future. Instead their livelihoods are being thrown into turmoil because of Ineos' irresponsibility which risks the future of the site. "Anger is growing among workers and the company now risks destroying good Scottish jobs and a powerhouse of the Scottish economy." He added: "Once again I call on Ineos to drop the cynical blackmail, start the plant up and talk seriously about securing a future for Grangemouth." Unite has published a strongly-worded advert in a number of Scottish Sunday newspapers titled: "A message to the people of Scotland". It described Grangemouth as the "powerhouse" of Scotland's economy and urged management to open the plant. The advert said: "This climate of fear has been created to try to force working men and women into signing away their rights and the pensions which they have saved all their working lives. "This is a company out of control. This is holding Scotland to ransom." The advert asked people to support the workforce and contact MPs and MSPs. Ineos said the dispute had cost it £20m on top of monthly losses of £10m. The company has warned that the plant would close in 2017 without fresh investment and changes to workers' terms and conditions. It has put forward a survival plan for the site and asked workers to back changes to their contracts and conditions as part of the proposals by 18:00 on Monday ahead of a shareholders meeting on Tuesday. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Ineos chairman Jim Ratcliffe said the fate of the Grangemouth site rested with the workforce. He said: "This is not a bluff. The clock is ticking, Grangemouth could have a future but that is absolutely in the hands of the workers." Gordon Grant, Ineos site manager at Grangemouth, said: "We have to address the facts and the facts are that we need the survival plan to have a long-term future, a very, very good long-term future for Grangemouth, and for Scotland. "That's what we are putting forward and that's what we are asking our employees to support." The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans. </body>

      <title>Protest at Shankill bomber memorial</title>
      <description>A memorial ceremony for an IRA man who died while planting a bomb, killing himself and nine other people 20 years ago, is taking place in Belfast as loyalists protest against the commemoration.</description>

      <body>A memorial ceremony for an IRA man who died while planting a bomb, killing himself and nine other people 20 years ago, is taking place in Belfast. Thomas Begley was responsible for the Shankill Road bombing in October 1993. He was carrying the device into a shop when it exploded prematurely. The bomber's father unveiled a plaque during the commemoration ceremony which was organised by Begley's friends. A loyalist protest against the event is taking place on Belfast's Crumlin Road. Some of Begley's victims have criticised the commemoration, saying it has added to their grief. The nine other people killed in the IRA attack were all Protestant civilians, including two children age seven and 13. Begley's father mentioned the pain of the people of the Shankill Road as he unveiled the plaque at the commemoration in north Belfast on Sunday afternoon. The plaque states that the bomber "died on active service" and is "always remembered by his many comrades and friends". It also includes a quote from the former IRA leader, Seamus Twomey. The crowd was also addressed by Sean Kelly, the IRA man who was with Begley on the day and survived the bomb. The attack took place on a busy Saturday afternoon in the heart of one of Belfast's best known loyalist areas. Begley and his IRA accomplice, Kelly, posed as fishmongers and carried the bomb into Frizzell's fish shop where shoppers were queuing for food. In addition to the 10 deaths, a further 57 people were injured by the bomb. They included Kelly, who was pulled from the rubble of the collapsed building. Kelly received a total of nine life sentences for his role in the attack but was released early in July 2000, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. Families of some of the Shankill bomb victims condemned the commemoration when the plans emerged earlier this month. A flyer advertising the memorial, which stated also that Begley had "died on active service" caused controversy when it was circulated on social media. The Begley family, from Ardoyne in north Belfast, have previously publically stated their opposition to the Shankill Road bombing and their son's role in the IRA attack. Last week, the bomber's brother, Sean Begley, told the Belfast Newsletter that his family had not been involved in producing the flyer or the plaque tribute, but would be attending the memorial service to mark the 20th anniversary of his death. Michelle Williamson, who lost both her parents in the explosion, wrote a personal letter to Begley's parents, asking them to call off the ceremony. She told them she had "no problem in acknowledging your loss" but said the unveiling of the plaque to a bomber was "a sick and cruel insult to the memory of our loved ones". Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams, who caused outrage among victims when he carried Begley's coffin in 1993, was asked about the commemoration as he attended a peace conference in London on Saturday. Mr Adams told the BBC: "I think we have to be very sensitive about all of this. Thomas Begley has a family, those families arguably are victims. "One could argue that Thomas Begley is not a victim because he was engaged in an IRA operation at the time," the Sinn Féin leader said. "My understanding of this is that, it is a group of friends and family members who simply want, in a very dignified and respectful way - not in any way celebration or triumphalism or any of the rest of it. "The Shankill Road bombing, we all know inflicted awful hurt upon the people who were killed and those people who were injured. "So I'm very mindful, as we seek to build the future, that we have to deal the the past, and part of the problem for victims is that the past is the present. "It's not going away, so we need to be ultra, ultra careful and sensitive to everybody's feelings in this situation," Mr Adams added. </body>

      <title>Anger as diabetic children miss out</title>
      <description>Some health boards are not following mandatory guidelines by failing to provide insulin pumps to children with type 1 diabetes, BBC Wales finds.</description>

      <body>Some health boards in Wales are not following mandatory guidelines by failing to provide insulin pumps to children with type 1 diabetes, BBC Wales has found. Pumps change the lives of diabetics by removing the need for daily injections and must be provided if needed. But BBC Wales has found there are 29 young patients in Wales waiting for insulin pump therapy. The Welsh government said it expected health boards to follow the guidelines. BBC Radio Wales current affairs programme Eye On Wales spoke to the Children's Commissioner for Wales who said it could be a breach of the children's human rights. There are two kinds of diabetes. Type 2 accounts for 90% of cases - and 10% of NHS spending - and is linked to lifestyle, obesity and age. Type 1 diabetes has no link to lifestyle choices and occurs when the pancreas fails to produce the insulin the body needs to process glucose. It is managed by measuring the sugar in the bloodstream and then giving the body the insulin it needs to survive. There are approximately 16,000 people with type 1 diabetes in Wales and 1,400 of them are children and young people. Nine-year-old Emily Agutter, from Usk in Monmouthshire, has to test her blood sugar levels and inject herself with insulin several times a day after being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes over a year ago. She does not like the injections and would like to try an insulin pump but her health board has told her family she cannot have one yet. Emily has been waiting for 10 months despite the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines which say one should be provided. Her father, Neil Agutter, who also has type 1 diabetes, has an insulin pump. "It makes me incredibly angry - it's there in black and white," Mr Agutter said. "We have asked and there are funding issues in terms of resources for the hospital. "The hospital doctors and nurses who treat Emily are lovely and they do a great job. We've just been told they can't do it yet, there's too many people waiting. And when somebody's nine years old, it's a long time for somebody so young." Emily is not the only child with type 1 diabetes waiting for an insulin pump in Wales. Eye on Wales has learned that three health boards have children on a waiting list - Emily's own board, Aneurin Bevan, has 15 youngsters waiting while Cardiff and Vale has 11 and Hywel Dda, three. "If you're on a waiting list then I think you could take a pretty clear view that that's a breach of that child's rights," said the Children's Commissioner for Wales Keith Towler. "Now if the child wants the pump and the family are happy for the child to have the pump, then actually sort out the resource issues later if you have to, but actually just make that pump available. "This is a life-changing diagnosis for a child and that child needs as much support as they can possibly get. Let's take it right back to the child and make sure that the child gets that service." Aneurin Bevan Health Board said while it could not comment on individual cases it was committed to increasing access to insulin pump therapy as a treatment option. The board said it planned to increase the number of children on the therapy from 33 to 90 over the next two years. Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: "I'm afraid just in the practical world, it won't always be the case that the minute someone has been assessed for an insulin pump that that pump will immediately be available..." He said staff were also required to make sure the pump was "successfully used". "So I would expect anybody who has been assessed that every effort is made at local health board level to make the period of time they have to wait between being assessed for suitability and getting the pump to be short as possible," he said. "I certainly expect the health boards will follow mandatory NICE guidance, that they have to find ways within their very stretched budgets to be able to do that." He said the Welsh NHS spent £500m a year on diabetes, and health boards had to prioritise and put the money where it was most needed. Eye on Wales is on BBC Radio Wales on Sunday, 20 October at 12:00 BST. </body>

      <title>Rail disruption during major events</title>
      <description>The first minister criticises the timing of engineering work on the Severn Tunnel during two major events in Cardiff.</description>

      <body>The first minister has criticised Network Rail over the closure of the Severn Tunnel during two major events in Cardiff. The tunnel will close for maintenance work on the same weekend as the opening ceremony for the Rugby League World Cup, and the Womex music festival. Speaking to BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme, Carwyn Jones said Network Rail had not consulted the Welsh government over the closure. Network Rail said it was vital work. But Mr Jones said: "They've got form on this. It's an important point here - when we've got events in Cardiff, why do maintenance work on the Severn Tunnel when those events are taking place? "If there were events taking place every single week in the Millennium Centre, the Millennium Stadium or the [Cardiff] City Stadium, you might say 'okay, there are some weekends when that's inevitable' but for some reason they choose weekends when there are big events taking place in Cardiff." The Severn Tunnel - which runs under the River Severn on the south Wales-London mainline - will be closed for maintenance on the weekend of 26-27 October - the same weekend as the Rugby League World Cup opening ceremony at the Millennium Stadium and Womex world music festival at the Millennium Centre. Mr Jones believes the closures will cause travel problems, having a negative impact on the world-wide image of Wales. He said a similar closure in 1999 caused problems for fans travelling to and from the Wales v England rugby international at Wembley Stadium in London. Mr Jones added that he recognised the need for maintenance and regretted that an alternative rail route was not considered when the second Severn bridge was built. "The big problem is of course that a rail deck wasn't put on the Severn Bridge in 1993 - other countries would have done that - and we wouldn't have these problems with the Severn Tunnel," said the first minister. "Yes it needs maintenance. It's a very wet tunnel [I know] having been through there in a cab of a 125 [train], but let's do it when there's not a big game on in Cardiff." In a statement Network Rail told Sunday Politics Wales: "There is never a good time to do work on the Severn Tunnel and we thoroughly investigated the Welsh government's request. "In this instance, this six-week works package was planned two years in advance and had already been put back a week to accommodate the one-day cricket match between England and Australia in September. "This vital project cannot be put back any further and to cancel it would have a negative impact on services from south Wales to London." Network Rail added it had assured the organisers of the 2015 Rugby Union World Cup that it would not schedule any disruptive work during the period the tournament was on at the Millennium Stadium. Sunday Politics Wales is on BBC One Wales at 11:00 BST on Sunday, 20 October. </body>

      <description>Tunisian security forces kill at least nine suspected Islamist militants who are blamed for a deadly attack on police patrols, officials say.</description>

      <body>Tunisian security forces have killed at least nine suspected Islamist militants who are blamed for a deadly attack on a police patrol, officials say. They say at least three other suspects were arrested in the operation in the Mount Taouyer area, about 70km (44 miles) west of the capital, Tunis. Two policemen died when they were attacked in the area on Thursday. Interior Ministry spokesman Mohamed Ali Aroui said the militants belonged to the Salafist Ansar al-Sharia group. The group has been declared a terrorist organisation by the government and the interior ministry spokesman told reporters on Saturday that the three-day operation "has been a success". About two tonnes of materials used to make explosives were also seized. The killing of the two police officers led to an angry response from security forces when Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki, Prime Minister Ali Larayedh and other senior officials attended a memorial service for the men on Friday. The leaders were forced to leave the ceremony because of the hostility. Ansar al-Sharia has been blamed for the murders of two secular opposition politicians earlier this year. Their deaths also triggered mass protests against Tunisia's Islamist-led government. Several other militant groups - including al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb - also operate in the region. But the latest clashes were significantly closer to the capital than previous fighting with suspected Islamists. Since the popular revolt that sparked the "Arab Spring" in 2011, Tunisia has seen a rise in attacks by militants. A coalition led by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party was elected in 2011. But some government critics accuse it of being soft on hardline Islamist forces - charges it strongly denies. </body>

      <title>Welby makes detour to Kenya</title>
      <description>The Archbishop of Canterbury is meeting fellow archbishops from the conservative Gafcon movement in Kenya after making a detour on his way from London to Iceland.</description>

      <body>The Archbishop of Canterbury has made a detour of more than 8,000 miles to visit Kenya - on his way to Iceland. Archbishop Justin Welby, who arrived on Saturday night, gave sermons at All Saints Cathedral on Sunday morning. He made the "last-minute" 24-hour trip to offer condolences after the Westgate centre attack, Lambeth Palace said. He is also meeting conservative Church leaders who are in Nairobi for this week's conference of the breakaway world Anglican group, Gafcon. Archbishop Welby was due to fly to Iceland - via London's Heathrow Airport - on Sunday night. In Iceland, he will attend a primates' meeting of the Porvoo Communion, formed of churches mainly in northern Europe. At least 67 people died when suspected al-Shabab militants stormed the Westgate shopping centre, in Nairobi, on 21 September. The attack sparked a four-day siege in which large parts of the shopping centre were destroyed. "The aim of the visit is to offer condolences and encouragement to the people of Kenya and those affected by the Westgate attack and to offer support to bishops in Kenya", a spokeswoman for Lambeth Palace said. The Archbishop of Canterbury stayed overnight at the home of the Archbishop of Kenya Eliud Wabukala - who is also the current chairman of Gafcon - the Global Anglican Future Conference. Archbishop Welby delivered sermons at 09:30 and 11:00 before having lunch with the Archbishop of Kenya and five Kenyan bishops. Gafcon 2013 - the second such conference - will run from Monday to Saturday. The original conference - held in Jerusalem in June 2008 - was organised in response to the appointment of actively gay men and women as bishops, especially in the US. Through the Gafcon movement, conservative Anglican provinces - mostly in parts of Africa but some in South and North America, Asia and the Middle East- have begun to function independently of the official Anglican Communion. Gafcon has condemned those who preach a "false gospel" which "claims God's blessing for same-sex unions over against the biblical teaching on holy matrimony". Lambeth Palace said the Archbishop of Canterbury was unable to accept an invitation to attend Gafcon 2013 because of his longstanding trip to Iceland and because he would be baptising Prince George at St James's Palace on Wednesday. Gafcon leaders have said the archbishop's predecessor, Dr Rowan Williams, was not forthright enough in condemning the appointment of gay bishops. The Archbishop of Kenya told BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme that Archbishop Welby was "new to us and to the communion". "I think he is interested in connecting with the activities of the communion and the Gafcon movement is part of those very significant activities that he will not miss," he added. "I think it's significant that he has recognised that fact," he added. "We hope things may not work the way they worked last time. "He has been to various parts in in Africa. He has been to Kenya before. "I think he has the experience to learn and also to be able to connect." In March, Archbishop Welby acknowledged that some gay couples have loving, stable and monogamous relationships of "stunning" quality. He told BBC News he had "particular friends where I recognise that and am deeply challenged by it". But he said he still supported the Church of England's formal opposition to active homosexuality. </body>

      <body>Thousands of people have taken to the streets of Hong Kong to protest against what they see as a lack of government transparency and accountability. Police put the turnout at 20,000, while organisers said 120,000 were there. The controversy was sparked last week when the government declined to grant a free-to-air licence to Hong Kong Television Network. Critics of the government have urged officials to give a clear account of why the licence was refused. Organiser Kristine Chan, from Hong Kong Free TV Action, told the Associated Press: "People are feeling very angry about this event, that the government is not really giving us many choices of free TV and trying to monopolise the industry by limiting the licences." Lawrence Lau, a Hong Kong citizen taking part in the protest, said: "They don't have the resolve to make a fair decision. They always suppress Hong Kong people and try to favour the government in Beijing." A spokesman for the city's Commerce Bureau has said the content of discussions made during meetings of the Executive Council were, as a rule, not made public. </body>

      <body>Opposition supporters in the Maldives have staged protests after police intervened to stop the presidential election from taking place. Police prevented ballot papers from being sent out on Saturday, saying two of the three candidates had failed to approve the registry of voters. The elections commission has accused the police of exceeding their mandate The Maldives has been in turmoil since ex-President Mohamed Nasheed was ousted in disputed circumstances in 2012. The first round of the election, held earlier this month, was won by Mr Nasheed, the Maldives' first democratically elected president. But that result was annulled and the second round of voting postponed amid allegations of electoral fraud, although international monitors said the process had been free and fair. Mr Nasheed has been leading the peaceful protests in the capital, Male. His supporters blocked a main road, drinking tea and eating snacks in a display of civil disobedience. Protesters spread out banners calling for the election to take place immediately and asking, "where is my vote". The current president, Mohamed Waheed Hassan - who had already pulled out of the leadership race after performing badly in the annulled first round - has proposed that the re-run be held on 26 October. "I hope that over that week, any outstanding problems will be ironed out," he told the Associated Press, saying he wanted to ensure a new president was installed before the end of his term on 11 November. The two remaining presidential candidates - Gasim Ibrahim and Abdulla Yameen - have been fighting for the re-run not to take place. Late on Friday, they sought an injunction against the election at the Supreme Court. They complained that they had not had time to endorse the registry of voters - a newly introduced requirement. The court did not issue an injunction but nor did it give a clear instruction for the election to go ahead. On Saturday, electoral commission head Fuwad Thowfeek said police had entered his offices and were stopping officials distributing election materials. Police spokesman Abdulla Nawaz said the election was stopped because the commission did not comply with a court order to have the voters' list endorsed by all candidates. But Mr Thowfeek accused them of exceeding their mandate. "We are very much concerned about what is going on in this country. The Supreme Court decision does not ask police officers to look into the voters' list and check what is there," he told reporters. The cancellation caused alarm among the country's international partners. India's foreign ministry said it was "seriously concerned at attempts to stall the democratic process", while a US embassy official in Sri Lanka said the delay "represents a real threat to democracy in Maldives". UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said he was "deeply dismayed" and called for the democratic process in the Maldives to be allowed to proceed.

      <title>Germany's SPD backs coalition talks</title>
      <description>Senior members of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) agree a series of economic demands ahead of coalition talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel.</description>

      <body>Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) has agreed a series of economic demands ahead of coalition talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel next week. SDP leaders promised the 200 members meeting on Sunday that they would win concessions from Mrs Merkel's centre-right bloc including a minimum wage. Mrs Merkel's alliance won recent elections but fell short of a majority. In 2005-2009 the SPD formed a "grand" coalition with Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and its allies the CSU. But correspondents say the experience has made them wary about working with the CDU/CSU again. A majority of the 200 members meeting on Sunday backed a statement agreeing to the start of formal talks. An internal SPD document seen by Reuters before the meeting said the party would insist that 10 demands were non-negotiable. They include a minimum wage of 8.50 euros (£7) per hour, equal pay for men and women, greater investment in infrastructure and education, and a common strategy to boost eurozone growth and employment. The party would also demand equal pensions for the elderly in the former West and East Germany and measures to make it easier to combine work with family life, Reuters reported. No mention was made of tax increases for the wealthiest, which the SPD had campaigned on during September's election. Allies of Chancellor Merkel have said they could live with a minimum wage but not with the higher taxes. The SDP also wants to move away from tough austerity measures and focus more on growth and job creation. It is understood that talks on coalition policies and cabinet posts could begin as early as next Wednesday and could last more than a month. The BBC's Stephen Evans in Berlin says it will be interesting to see if the SPD pushes for the post of finance minister in any new government, as the post is currently filled by the CDU's Wolfgang Schaeuble, seen as the driver of Germany's tough economic policy. Mrs Merkel's previous coalition ally, the Free Democrats, failed to win any seats in September leaving Mrs Merkel seeking a new partner. Her options narrowed last week when the Greens announced that talks with the CDU/CSU had failed. At the polls on 22 September, the CDU/CSU took about 41.5% of the vote, the SPD won 26%, the former communist Left Party 8.6% and the Greens 8.4%. </body>

      <title>'Secret burial' for Nazi Priebke</title>
      <description>Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke, who died under house arrest in Rome last week, is to be buried in a secret location, his lawyer says.</description>

      <body>Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke, who died under house arrest in Rome last week, is to be buried in a secret location, his lawyer has said. On Wednesday, his coffin was seized by the Italian authorities and taken to a military base near Rome after a funeral was halted amid angry protests. Rome city authorities had banned any burial in the city. Priebke was extradited from Argentina and jailed for life in Italy over the 1944 killing of 335 civilians. "The agreement satisfies the family and ethical and spiritual requirements," said his lawyer, Paolo Giachini, adding that there would be "a small ceremony for relatives" following the funeral. The whereabouts of the burial are unknown but Mr Giachini is reported as saying that "we had contacts to bury the coffin of Priebke both in Italy and in Germany". A cardiologist has offered to have the remains interred in his family's grave near Verona, but the local mayor is said to be against the proposal. The German embassy in Rome has said it had not been contacted by Priebke's lawyer and had no request for a burial, the Italian news agency Ansa quoted embassy sources as saying. Argentina - where Priebke lived for nearly 50 years before being extradited to Italy - refused to fulfil his wish to have his body repatriated for burial beside his wife. Priebke's hometown in Germany also refused to take the body, over fears that any place of burial could become a pilgrimage site for neo-Nazis. He was one of the SS officers overseeing the killing of men and boys at Rome's Ardeatine Caves in March 1944, one of the worst massacres in Italy during World War II. In a reprisal for the killing of 33 German soldiers in Rome by resistance fighters, 335 Italian civilians were shot dead. Though Priebke admitted his role in the massacre, he never expressed any remorse and maintained he was following orders. In a video message recorded before he died - and released posthumously by his lawyer - the former SS officer repeated the defence he had given at his war crimes trial. He said he had received direct orders from Adolf Hitler to carry out the massacre. Priebke was extradited in 1994 after investigative journalists from US television network ABC News tracked him down in Argentina. In 1998, he was sentenced to life in prison. However, he pleaded that he was too old and sick for jail, and was soon allowed to switch to a regime of house arrest. The Vatican issued an unprecedented ban on holding Priebke's funeral in any Catholic church in Rome, but a Catholic splinter group, the Society of St Pius X, tried to hold a ceremony on Tuesday outside the city, in Albano Laziale. </body>

      <description>A commuter train in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, crashes at the end of the line, leaving at least 80 people injured.</description>

      <body>A commuter train in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, has crashed at the end of the line, leaving at least 80 people injured. The train failed to stop as it arrived at Once station, crashing through the buffers and ending up wedged between the floor and ceiling of the platform. The accident happened at the same station where 51 people were killed in a similar crash last year. The cause of the accident remains unclear. Saturday's crash happened shortly after 07:00 local time (10:00 GMT). The line from Moreno 40km (25 miles) west of Buenos Aires to Once station, operated by the Sarmiento train company, is normally a busy commuter line during the week, and its trains are usually packed with passengers. Security Secretary Sergio Berni said some of those injured on Saturday had been waiting on the platform and were hurt by flying glass as the train's windows shattered. Jorge Ramirez, a chef who got on the train nine stations before the end of the line, told the AP news agency the accident was "a tragedy". "I saw people hurt, shouting, others thrown on the floor. The people in the first wagon ended up piled on top of each other," he said. After the 2012 crash, the authorities revoked a local company's right to operate trains on the line and pledged to make new investments in safety. But commuters complain of frequent delays and bad service, and it is not uncommon to see travellers crammed into trains on their way to work, says the BBC's Ignacio de los Reyes in Buenos Aires. </body>

      <body>The authorities in Mexico have said gunmen dressed as clowns have shot dead a former leading member of a once-powerful and violent drug cartel. Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix, 63, was killed in a beach resort in Baja California in north-western Mexico. He and his brothers controlled the drug trade on Mexico's border with the United States in the 1990s. But their Tijuana cartel was gradually weakened by the capture or killing of other leading members. "He was hit by two bullets, one in the chest and one in the head," said Isai Arias, a Baja California state government official. The motive for the attack and the gunmen's disguise were being investigated, he added. The attack took place during a family party at a rented beach house in the tourist resort of Cabo San Lucas. The former cartel leader was arrested in 1993 but released nearly 15 years later after spending time in prison in Mexico and the United States. His brother Eduardo was jailed in August in the US for 15 years after pleading guilty to money laundering. Security experts believe the Tijuana cartel is now run by his sister Enedina and her son Fernando, known as "The Engineer", according to AFP news agency. Most estimates put the number of people killed in Mexican drug-related violence since late 2006 at more than 60,000. </body>

      <body>Five suicide bombers have attacked government buildings in Iraq's western Anbar province killing two policemen and three officials, police say. At least 20 people were injured. No group has said it carried out the attack but police told the BBC they suspect Sunni Muslim insurgents. Iraq has experienced a surge in violence in recent months. In another incident, police said a suicide bomber killed six people in the city of Samarra, north of Baghdad. The bomber targeted the house of a senior policeman but he is believed to have survived the attack. Those killed are said to be members of his family. In Anbar province, police said two bombers on foot and another driving a vehicle rigged with explosives attacked the police headquarters in the town of Rawa. The other suicide bombers struck an army checkpoint at the town's entrance and the local administrative headquarters where officials were meeting. It was the second attack in less than a month to hit Rawa, about 75km (45 miles) from the Syrian border. Analysts say more than 6,000 people have been killed in acts of violence in Iraq this year. Correspondents say the failure of Iraq's Shia-led government to address the grievances of Iraq's Sunni Arab minority has driven the surge in unrest. Many Sunnis complain of being excluded from government jobs and senior posts and of abuses by security forces. </body>

      <title>Hostages freed in Lebanon swap deal</title>
      <description>Nine Lebanese citizens kidnapped in Syria last year return home to Beirut, after a complex hostage deal sees two Turkish pilots released in Lebanon.</description>

      <body>Nine Lebanese citizens who were kidnapped by rebels in Syria in May 2012 have arrived back in Beirut a day after being released. There were jubilant scenes as they were greeted on the tarmac by family members and Lebanese politicians. Two Turkish pilots who were being held hostage in Lebanon were also freed as part of a complex swap. Murat Akpinar and Murat Agca were seized in Beirut in August in a retaliatory abduction. They were met by their relatives and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan after flying to Istanbul on a Qatari jet late on Saturday. A third part of the hostage negotiations - reportedly mediated by Qatar, Turkey and the Palestinian Authority - involved the release of a number of female prisoners being held by the Syrian government. It is not yet clear whether that has taken place. The Lebanese group, all men, were released by their captors on Friday evening and driven to Istanbul, from where they flew to Beirut. At the airport they were greeted by friends and family, as well as politicians and religious leaders. The men appeared tired but in good health. "A whole year passed and each of us never slept more than two hours a night due to exhaustion and too much thinking about what would or could happen to us," one told the BBC. Others described being kept in dark and windowless rooms and hearing heavy fighting. "Our abductors didn't respect us, they treated us badly," Ali Zogheib was quoted as saying by Lebanese media. "We wished that any of them had any kind of values", another said of his captors. One of the pilgrims thought they had been held close to the Syrian border with Turkey. The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says it is clear that huge effort has gone into producing the complicated deal. Lebanon's security chief Maj Gen Abbas Ibrahim, who co-ordinated the hostage release, said it had been "difficult, without a doubt". "I didn't want anything from this deal, except to see this sight,'' he said, gesturing at the cheering crowds. The nine Lebanese were among 11 people seized while making their way back to Lebanon after a tour of holy sites in Iran. Two of them escaped. They were reportedly being held in northern Syria by fighters from a Sunni-based rebel group opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The rebels insisted their hostages were fighters with the Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah, and were demanding the release of women detainees held by the Syrian regime in exchange. Then in August, Murat Akpinar and Murat Agca were seized from a bus close to Beirut's international airport. A previously unknown group called Zuwwar al-Imam Rida said it had kidnapped them, and that they would be freed if the Lebanese group were set free. It demanded that Turkey used its influence with Syrian rebels to make the swap possible. In response, Turkey advised its citizens in Lebanon to leave if possible. Turkey has consistently backed Syria's Sunni rebels, while much of Lebanon's Shia community supports President Bashar al-Assad. The pilots' abduction sparked protests in Lebanon, and growing concerns that the Syrian civil war was spilling over the border. Earlier this week they appeared in a video broadcast on Lebanese television saying they were both well and wanted to go home. Then, as word came late on Saturday that the Lebanese citizens were back in Beirut, the pilots arrived in Istanbul. They told Turkish media that they had been treated well in captivity. But Mr Akpinar told the Hurriyet newspaper that "first month has been very difficult". "We have been transferred eight times, each time as if it was a new kidnapping." "We chose to have a good understanding with them. And we did, so much that one of our (kidnappers) has even decided to call his new son Murat," Mr Akpinar added. Syrian and Lebanese politics have been deeply intertwined throughout the history of the two states. Syria had a large military presence in Lebanon for 29 years. It finally withdrew its soldiers in 2005, but has maintained a strong influence. The conflict in Syria, now in its third year, has claimed more than 100,000 lives and created more than two million refugees. Our correspondent says that while the war rages on, the hostage exchange creates a small glimmer of hope as efforts intensify to arrange a peace conference in Geneva next month. </body>

      <description>Two convicted murderers who used forged documents to trick their way out of prison in Florida have been recaptured, US officials say.</description>

      <body>Two convicted murderers who used forged documents to trick their way out of prison in Florida have been recaptured, US officials say. Joseph Jenkins and Charles Walker, both 34, were seized without incident at a motel in Panama City, Florida. The men, who were serving life sentences, had been freed from separate jails after officials were fooled by fake papers reducing their terms. The prison authorities have pledged to tighten up their early-release policy. The two convicts were arrested at the Coconut Grove Motor Inn on Saturday evening, the authorities said. They were detained hours after relatives held a news conference urging them to turn themselves in. Jenkins had walked out on 27 September and registered as felon three days later at a jail in Orange County, Florida, about 300 miles (480km) from the prison where he was serving his sentence. Walker had been set free on 8 October from the same prison and registered on 11 October. The falsified documents were not identified until several weeks after the first convict's release. It is not clear who provided the bogus release documents. The two prisoners had apparently signed on to maintain the ruse that they had been released early by a judge. Released felons are required to register as they re-enter the public, otherwise a warrant is issued for their arrest. The registration process includes fingerprinting, images of which are uploaded to Florida police records. Officials also verify that felons do not have any outstanding warrants. Release documents bearing the forged signature of a sitting judge had been processed through standard channels this autumn, officials said. Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry said there were several red flags that should have alerted the court clerk's office or the corrections department: notably, how rare it was for a sentence reduction to come from prosecutors. On Friday, Florida Corrections Secretary Michael Crews said prisons would now verify with judges, not just court clerks, before releasing prisoners early. Authorities have been reviewing other releases based on modified court orders received from Orange County, to ensure no other inmates have been prematurely freed. Jenkins was serving a life sentence for the 1998 fatal shooting of a father of six during a botched robbery. Walker was sentenced to life in prison for the 1999 shooting of a 23-year-old man. Walker said he did not mean to kill the man but fired three shots in warning because the man had been bullying him. </body>

      <title>Former US House Speaker Foley dies</title>
      <description>Former Democratic US Speaker of the House of Representatives Tom Foley, credited with reaching across the aisles in a more bipartisan Congress, dies.</description>

      <body>A former US Speaker of the House of Representatives who was credited with reaching across the aisles in a less bitterly divided Congress has died. Tom Foley, 84, died of complications from a stroke on Friday, his wife said. Born and raised in the north-western US state of Washington, the Democrat served in the House for 30 years and was speaker from 1989-1995. "America has lost a legend of the United States Congress," President Barack Obama said in a statement. "Tom's straightforward approach helped him find common ground with members of both parties," Mr Obama said. As speaker, he was an active negotiator in the 1990 budget talks that led to President George HW Bush breaking his pledge to never raise taxes. "Tom never got personal or burned bridges," Mr Bush said on Friday. "We didn't agree on every issue, but on key issues we managed to put the good of the country ahead of politics." Foley also allowed the House to vote on the resolution that approved the 1990 Iraq war, despite his own personal reservations and the objections of many fellow Democrats. "He granted our request for a vote because it was the right thing to do," Bob Michel, the Republican minority leader at the time, said. "He was that kind of leader." But Foley became the first House Speaker to be ousted by voters in his own constituency - as opposed to through a majority change in the chamber or a no-confidence vote from his own party - since the US Civil War. He was defeated by 4,000 votes in November 1994 by Spokane lawyer George Nethercutt, a Republican who supported term limits, which Foley had long fought. That was the year of the so-called Republican revolution led by Newt Gingrich, who became House Speaker in 1995. On Friday, the current House Speaker, John Boehner, called Foley "a model for any speaker or representative". "Tom Foley endeared himself not only to the wheat farmers back home but also colleagues on both sides of the aisle," Mr Boehner said. After leaving the House, Foley served as US ambassador to Japan for four years. </body>

      <description>The fantastical farmers' sheds in demand as holiday homes</description>

      <body>The latest property of choice for holiday home buyers in Southern Italy is not a rustic villa or a rambling farmhouse - it is a former farmer's shed, which would not look out of place on the set of Lord of the Rings. Trulli are the trademark of Puglia - existing nowhere but the Valley of Itria. Round limestone buildings with conical roofs, they are as magical as they are historical. Dotted across the landscape, alone or in clusters, with one cone or even a dozen, they look like miniature rustic fairytale castles - Asterix meets Disney. Originally nothing more than farmers' sheds used to store equipment or animals, the structure is made with the same drystone technique as the low walls that demarcate the olive groves. No cement, just local limestone cut into large, heavy slabs called chiancarelle - carefully positioned to make the perfect water-tight structure. It is said that back in the 1600s, when there was a tax on new buildings, the locals built trulli so they could be dismantled when the inspectors came and rebuilt after they had gone. In between viewings estate agent, Alessandro Melpignano tells us enthusiastically about the trullo revival. They became trendy holiday homes when the Trulli of Alberobello became a Unesco world heritage site in 1996. "That is when the market really exploded", he explains. The first to buy were the Germans, who soon got fed up with break-ins. The British were hot on their heels. "But they have stayed," says Melpignano. "And they are still buying. Low-cost flights to Bari and Brindisi have helped keep them coming." Trulli need renovating every 100 to 150 years. It takes around a month to rebuild a cone and costs about 15,000 euros (£12,700). Do they have experts who renovate and rebuild trulli? "Oh yes," he grins. "They are called trullari. And I know a master trullaro." The next morning I go in search of Giovanni d'Errico and find him, unsurprisingly, building a trullo. If anybody ever looked the part, it is d'Errico, who bears an uncanny resemblance to a Hobbit. He tells me he has always been passionate about trulli, but when he was young, nobody cared about them. "They were mostly abandoned ruins. People saw them as hovels for the poor." "I became a trullaro about 20 years ago. Before that I was a tiler. When I began, there was just one trullaro left in this area. It was a dying trade. Now there are loads of us." I wonder if d'Errico thinks tourists are mad for falling in love with old farmers' sheds? On the contrary, he says he is supremely grateful. "They gave us work and a bit of well-being - they brought our abandoned land back to life. "Even if it has slowed down with the recession and heavy taxes on homeowners, our profession's still growing. I do not make a fortune but I do love my job. It is a beautiful thing that everyone wants a trullo." According to Giuseppe Miccolis, another master trullaro specialising in historic trulli, "the problem is that anyone can set himself up as a trullaro without any formal training or qualification". Miccolis, who comes from a long line of trullari, was born into the profession. "At the age of three, I used to play with the stones. At 14 I started working." He considers his trade an art and a passion. But it is tinged with disappointment and frustration. "It is not just the unskilled self-styled trullari, it is the people who build illegally without respecting our landscape." Nevertheless, Giuseppe is determined to preserve his beloved traditional craft. He has begun taking school children on walks, visiting historic trulli and explaining and demonstrating how they are built. "I am hoping to inspire local kids to develop the passion my family passed on to me. I am going to organise walks for tourists too," he says. "Why don't you come back for one?" My eyes light up. "When?" From Our Own Correspondent: Listen online or download the podcast.

      <title>The Mary Poppins sequel that never was</title>
      <description>The Mary Poppins sequel that almost got made</description>

      <body>Brian Sibley is one of writing's multi-hyphenates. He is a prolific and award-winning writer of radio drama, such as Radio 4's acclaimed Lord of the Rings adaptations. He has written plays of his own and many books focusing on film. The subjects of his biographies range from CS Lewis to Mickey Mouse. In fact, a love of Disney has been central since childhood. At home his walls are plastered with Disney artwork. "In the 1980s, it was exciting to be flown over to LA to sit in script conferences at Disney, working on what looked like a marvellous project - the studio's second Poppins movie." Though the screenplay he wrote with PL Travers was never made, he looks back on the experience fondly. And he's in a unique position to explain what she really thought about the 1964 film. "I first corresponded with Pamela Travers in the 1970s, when I was writing a book about Walt Disney. I didn't get to meet her for a decade but when finally we met it quickly became a friendship. "Since she died, Pamela's been painted as an old dragon but it's not true: I'd go round for tea on a Sunday and she was great company. Writing with her turned out to be an eccentric experience but that was because she remained proprietorial about Mary Poppins. "But why shouldn't she be? - it was her creation. Though Pamela, who was very spiritual, would probably have said that the character had been given to her." The first Poppins film had been a massive hit. "But in some ways it's quite a loose adaptation, " Brian Sibley says. "Her books were really collections of free-standing short stories. The first film used elements both of the original Mary Poppins book (published 1934) and the second one, Mary Poppins Comes Back. "The Disney studio had been very keen to make a sequel but Pamela always said no. One Sunday we were having tea when she mentioned they'd been in contact. She described the latest idea to me and said she was about to reject it." "I said it was a pity there couldn't be a new film - so many people had loved the Mary Poppins character. Pamela said 'Oh I could only agree if I could do it on my own terms. I'd have to work with someone I trust.' And she paused. 'If it were you dear that would be different." "So I wrote a letter to Roy Disney (Walt's nephew, by now in charge) who I had met a few times. This was the 1980s and people still wrote letters. I told him there might be a chance of making the film. After a couple of days I got news Roy was sending someone to London to talk to me. Within a fortnight we were working on an outline." The project was Mary Poppins Comes Back, based on those parts of Travers' second book unused in 1964. Disney contracted Sibley and Travers to supply a treatment which they then set to work to expand. "For months I would sit and talk with Pamela at her home in Chelsea about the ideas I had. Then she would give me notes on what Mary Poppins would or would not do and think. She was very particular, even down to how a line should be said. I recorded her on tape and went away. Of course I then wrote what I needed to write - but I always bore her comments in mind. I would give her my script pages and she would write notes all over it. Some parts came back with 'no No NO!' scrawled all over the page. But she also said when she liked what I'd written." Sibley thinks they managed to find a balance between what Travers had written in her books and what the Poppins character then became in the film. But he also sensed a cloud looming over the movie's chances of getting made - the thorny issue of casting. "It was more than twenty years since the original so who could play Mary? Julie Andrews was no longer in her twenties and she had moved a long way from the My Fair Lady - Sound of Music stage of her career. Disney made an approach but it came to nothing. And who could ever have played Mary Poppins half as well?" Casting the world's most famous nanny was not the only quandary. "In our screenplay there was no longer a Bert (as played by Dick van Dyke). Instead there was Bert's brother, who had a similar function of being Mary's friend and possible admirer. Finding a Bert replacement was almost as tricky as re-casting the lead role. "I remember sitting in a restaurant on Rodeo Drive listening to an executive explain they thought Michael Jackson might be right for the part. Bear in mind this was an ice-cream seller in a park in Edwardian London. Or maybe it would have worked - who knows?" And contrary to popular belief, Sibley insists it's untrue that PL Travers hated the original film. "She may have mellowed in her views by the time I knew her but she knew there were good things in it. When we got down to work I thought it would be a good idea if we watched the original film first so I arranged a private screening. "I asked Pamela how long it was since she'd seen Poppins - this was the mid-1980s. She said 'Well not since the premiere, obviously'. I was astonished she hadn't seen this hugely famous film for more than twenty years. But Pamela didn't have a video or even a TV set. "Throughout the film she gave me notes. There were one or two moments where she said 'Oh that's terrible'. But there were more where she got excited at what was up there on screen. She patted my hand and said 'Oh we must remember that, that's excellent, I like that bit very much...' And that's how we began to build our screenplay." Eventually the sequel fell victim to a combination of inherent casting problems and the fact that new executives were running Disney. "But I treasured my time working with PL Travers," Sibley says. "And we stayed in touch almost until she died. She was demanding as a friend. But she had great wisdom and great knowledge of so many things: literature, life, love, faith. She was prickly and difficult at times. But she was also someone of a towering intellect whose friendship I really valued." </body>

      <body>Balkh province in northern Afghanistan is home to some of the most significant historical sites in the world - its ancient city was even known as the mother of all cities. More than a decade after her first visit, Lynne O'Donnell returns with a group of archaeologists, trying to uncover more of its treasures. Across the far northern Afghan plain, a hot wind blows the dun-coloured dust into blinding clouds, and the women's burkas into blue billows. It is 40C in the shade, and even the small black goats being herded through the sand dunes look sapped by the heat. These are the lowlands of Balkh, where ancient trade routes attracted nomads, warriors, settlers, adventurers and evangelists, who left behind secrets that archaeologists are just beginning to unlock. This area places Afghanistan at the heart of political, economic, social and religious power across Asia, as far back as 4,000 years ago. The last time I drove across the Bactrian plain was in 2001. I had sailed down the Amu Darya river on a barge from Uzbekistan as British and American forces were pounding the Taliban after the 9/11 attacks in the US. I have returned 12 years later with Afghan and French archaeologists to tour some of the oldest, most magnificent and historically significant sites in the world - sites that are shedding light not only on Afghanistan's past, but on the development of human civilisation, from India to China and beyond. The Bactrian plain is the treasure house of Afghanistan's secret history. Across this desert, Alexander the Great marched his army, killed the king of Balkh and married his beautiful daughter, Roxanne. Some 1,500 years later, Genghis Khan swept through and destroyed teeming cities that were melting pots of diversity. The philosopher Zoroaster, founder of the first monotheistic religion 3,500 years ago, lived and possibly died here. Rumi, the 13th Century poet who wrote in Persian, was born in Balkh - and is also, some Afghans like to think, buried here. Camel trains, loaded with freshly harvested cotton, lope across the parched landscape, against a backdrop of mud walls built to stop the encroachment of the desert on the fertile Balkh oasis. The French archaeologists are here to take a sample of the walls which surrounded a huge hexagonal fort, its shape only visible on satellite photos, strategically placed for both defence and water. They dig deep in to the foundations to fill a metal pipe with dirt, so scientists in Paris can gauge the last time the quartz in the clay saw light. For now, they are guessing around 2,500 years. Nearby in Dawlatabad is the tiny hospitable village of Zadian. We can only go with an armed police escort as the Taleban are active. Little girls in colourful scarves run squealing from the communal water pump as I raise my camera. Men in baggy trousers and turbans emerge to greet us from a shady walled garden. I look up, and my jaw drops. Against the flawless blue sky, a sun-baked clay minaret towers over us. It was built in the 12th Century, still nameless, missed by Ghengis Khan and his marauding Mongols - and by most visitors to this corner of the world ever since. In the oasis of Cheshma-e-Shifa, a huge white rock shaped like an anvil is the sole evidence of a city where Zoroastrian priests performed rituals for the thousands of people who lived here, 600 years before Christ. On the altar's flattened top is a well for oil which burned a perpetual flame that would have been visible across the valley. The French like to wonder if it was here that Alexander married Roxanne. French archaeologists have worked in Balkh for almost 100 years, interrupted by wars and invasions and, in the late 1990s, by the Taliban, who believed history only began with Islam in the 7th Century. In fact, in Afghanistan, Islam displaced Buddhism. The Taliban showed their contempt for history when they destroyed the giant Buddhas of Bamiyan in 2001. Today, archaeologists are confirming Afghanistan's role in spreading prosperity and philosophy across a quarter of the world for thousands of years. For them, the greatness of the past is an example for the future, and in Balkh they see not the violence of the present, but the romance of antiquity. The original Balkh is one of the oldest cities in history. All that remains is a dusty field surrounded by monumental walls that are slowly being revealed by painstaking excavations. In seven years, about 20 metres of the foundations have been unearthed. Visible from the top of the walls are the courtyards of the modern village. Here washing hangs, children chase dogs, donkeys pull carts, and the hot wind blows up endless clouds of dust. In Balkh, whatever comes next when the war ends and foreign troops leave the country next year, will soon be absorbed into Afghanistan's long history.

      <title>Warning children about online porn</title>
      <description>Can schools keep pupils safe and innocent?</description>

      <body>Concerns about children's exposure to graphic sexual images online have led to calls for primary pupils to hear about the dangers of pornography. So how should schools broach the subject and what is the right age to start? At Castledyke Primary in Barton, North Lincolnshire, head teacher Rosie Pugh has adopted a robust approach to building children's resilience to any explicit material they may see online and is in no doubt that it needs to start early. She fears there are children vulnerable to abuse among her pupils and describes some of the stories she has heard from families as "eye-popping". Her views echo fears voiced by Ofsted earlier this year in a report which found that a lack of quality age appropriate sex and relationships education in more than a third of schools risks leaving children vulnerable to inappropriate sexual behaviours and sexual exploitation. The BBC sat in on a session for seven- to nine-year-olds at Castledyke run by Lynnette Smith, who teaches sex education and trains teachers in the subject in North Lincolnshire and East Yorkshire. Her approach is cheerful, direct and accompanied by hand-drawn illustrations that look as if they might have been done by an off-duty artist from The Beano. Each picture presents a scenario to which the children are asked to give a thumbs up or thumbs down. Lynnette uses the same set of cards for presentations from four-year-olds in their first year of the infants, to 10 and 11-year-olds about to leave for secondary school. The children find it hilarious. There are gales of laughter, coupled with appalled cries of disgust, but the half-hour sessions, which involve the whole class of up to 30 children, their teacher and a learning assistant, tackle some serious issues. Classes like this may not be suitable for all primaries cautions Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT): "Innocence is precious. You don't want to start too young." "My bottom line is to ask, 'From what age are they vulnerable?'" says Ms Smith. "Our first card is a girl with no clothes on. She looks as if she is ready for the bath. Well I hope she is not going to school". Lynnette asks the children to list the body parts that they should not let people touch. "Your widger and your lucy," is the response. She encourages the class to use "scientific" names instead of colloquialisms. The class chorus words like genitals, penis and vagina. There is a point to this. Knowledge and understanding can help keep a child safe, says Lynnette. "Paedophiles will avoid an educated child." The cards tackle different forms of good and bad touching. A kiss with a smile, a boy giving another boy a flower. A thumbs up to all of this. Then, grabbing a woman's breasts, looking under toilet doors when someone is inside, pulling at a boy's underwear. Thumbs down to this, declare the class. The cards tackle subtleties like where it is OK to urinate, expose your genitals or underwear or indeed to "have a little rummage in your underwear" - not outside, in broad daylight, but somewhere private like the bathroom. What sort of photographs are OK? Smiling at the camera with all your clothes on gets a thumbs up. Showing your bottom to the camera, a thumbs down. "He could put it on the internet!" says a boy. "It's a private part of the body. Nobody should ever take pictures of the private parts of your body except perhaps if you get injured and have to go to hospital," explains Lynnette. The next card depicts an older boy apparently showing a younger child an unsuitable image he has downloaded on to a smartphone. "Wrong, wrong, wrong", yells one boy. "No-one should make you watch something like that. You must tell someone," says Lynnette. Each child is asked to think of someone at home and someone at school they would tell. The picture after that is the view from behind a sofa where two adults are watching a porn film. "There are films where the actors have no clothes on or are hurting each other that some grown-ups want to look at but it's not meant for children," says Lynette. "If this is grown-ups watching and you are not there then that's fine but not if it's your babysitter or older children." There are hints that some members of the class are already aware of this sort of film: "My brother looks at pictures like this. He's 20," one child says. When Lynette asks if the child is forced to look at the pictures, he says no. Lynnette says the attitude of most children and young people is the same as it ever was. "Most are the same naive little kids who just want to know more about their bodies and are totally appalled and repelled by the idea of sex. "There are still a lot like that even at 14. "But because I have been in sex education since the mid-90s, I have seen how it's progressing. In 2002 everyone got the internet and much younger children began to see pornography. "Ten- and 11-year-olds are often keen to tell you what they have seen." Sometimes, she says, this kind of exposure can lead to sexually inappropriate behaviour and make children vulnerable to sexual exploitation. At the very least, children are asking questions about sexual issues at a much earlier age, particularly if they have seen something online or in the media that they do not understand. Sex and relationship education, she argues, is in urgent need of updating as the current guidelines do not mention issues such as sexting (the sending of sexually explicit material via a mobile phone) or pornography. In her presentation to parents before the sessions with children, she explains how vital it is to talk to children about these issues in the early years of primary school. Ideally the parents should feel confident to answer their child's questions. "If you're not sure of an answer, research it, maybe together in a book," she advises. "Don't ever say, 'Ask me when you're older,' because that's like saying, 'Go and Google it.' "If they know that they can talk to you now they will keeping coming back to you for information into their teenage years. "Most parents get it about right until children are about five and then they get the jitters." Some of the mothers said they had been horrified when they first read the school's letter about Lynette's visit but were reassured by her explanations. "I thought, no they're only seven. My husband said thank heavens he was away," said one. "It was never like this when I was at school. You find sex on television even at seven in the evening. I don't know how to address it really but you have to talk about it," said another. Ofsted's report said some schools left children vulnerable to abuse because they did not teach them appropriate language or develop the confidence to describe unwanted behaviours. It also said sex education in some primary pupils left pupils "ill-prepared" for puberty. The NAHT has called for "conversations" about online dangers to start early in primary school but Mr Hobby says these should be "general warnings that they may see things they don't like online and advice on what to do about it when they do". With schools needing to walk a line between protecting children from harm and maintaining their innocence, Mr Hobby says: "It needs a decision for each primary school in full consultation with parents." For Castledyke's head teacher, encouraging parents and teachers to talk about the issue with children is key to helping protect youngsters in vulnerable families from becoming victims of abuse. "I am always really surprised about how coy some adults are, but once it's in the open it's quite simple. You just need to speak to children openly, honestly and confidently", says Ms Pugh. "We've got to stop it happening to another generation." </body>

      <title>Will machines ever be able to think?</title>
      <description>Will computers ever be able to think?</description>

      <body>The pursuit of artificial intelligence has long interested computer scientists, but will machines ever think for themselves, asks Lisa Jardine. In the early 1950s, "machine intelligence" was a favourite topic among those who wanted to put the war years behind them and look forward to a sparkling science-led future. From robots to electronic brains, the idea was that human beings would be able to concentrate on useful work, while programmable machines took care of useless toil. That unrealised dream still intrigues us today. In April 1951 I was taken by my parents on an outing to the Bristol laboratory of neuroscience professor William Grey Walter, to see his robotic tortoises. In a large room, half a dozen domed mechanised devices on wheels (roughly resembling tortoises) twirled and gyrated, avoided obstacles, backed away from the edges of their enclosure, and trundled apparently purposefully towards a light source beamed in their direction. These, Grey Walter maintained, were the beginnings of artificial intelligence - machines which simulated human thought and behaviour using analogue electronics to mimic brain processes. I remember the grown-ups were delighted. Back then, aged seven, I was a bit disappointed. These weren't "toys" in any sense that I understood. But the memory of the visit flooded back last weekend when I encountered a piece of archive film of the tortoises in the Codebreaker exhibition at London's Science Museum. Codebreaker charts the life and legacy of the troubled mathematician Alan Turing, best known for his crucial work on the Bombe electro-magnetical device, used to crack the code created by German Enigma machines during WWII. The exhibition includes the story of Bletchley Park, and the top secret cryptographical work Turing and others carried out there, which made such a vital contribution to the Allied victory. But it also explains a wide range of other work on early computers and machine intelligence. The Grey Walter tortoises feature as an early example of a complex machine which appears to replicate human behaviour - in other words, to think. Turing's own contributions to mathematics, and in particular to the theory behind early computers and computing went far beyond his wartime activities. Before he was recruited to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park in 1938 he had been working on the idea of a machine which could be programmed to carry out many different mathematical operations or tasks - the precursor for the electronic data processors we take for granted today. After the war Turing returned to this topic, and in 1950 published a paper entitled Computing Machinery and Intelligence, which is still cited today. In it, he speculates on what it would take for a computer to be considered to have gone beyond performing human-programmed tasks to become a "thinking machine". "I propose to consider the question," his paper begins, "Can machines think?" Arguing that they can, Turing chooses to engage directly with a computing pioneer of a century earlier who had given consideration to the question but reached the opposite conclusion - Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, or Ada Lovelace as she is generally known today. This week we celebrated Ada Lovelace day - an occasion on which we honour Lovelace herself and all other women working in what today are known as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). So let me say a little more about her before I get on to Turing's interest in her argument about machine intelligence. Lovelace was born in 1815, the only legitimate daughter of Lord Byron. Privately educated in science and mathematics, her mother was determined she should not become a poet like her father. She is acknowledged to be an important contributor to the early development of the computer and computer programming. Aged 17, Lovelace met Charles Babbage, conceiver of the Analytical Engine and regarded as the father of computing. His engine was never actually built, but is nevertheless generally recognised as the abstract precursor to a "universal machine" - one which can be programmed to perform a potentially infinite range of human tasks. Lovelace immersed herself in understanding the potential of the Analytical Engine. In the process she became possibly a clearer and more incisive exponent of it than Babbage himself. In 1842, at Babbage's request, Lovelace translated an Italian article discussing the potential of the Analytical Engine. She added a series of discussions of her own, explaining the possibilities for the engine and offering further explanation in considerable mathematical detail. These notes were approved by Babbage before publication, but Lovelace insisted on retaining total control. In late July 1842, for instance, she writes: "I am much annoyed at your having altered my note. You know I am always willing to make any required alterations myself, but that I cannot endure another person to meddle with my sentences." It is to these notes that Turing is referring a century later in his 1950 article. In one of them Lovelace says: "It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that might arise as to the powers of the Analytical Engine. The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis, but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths." We do not know how Turing came across Lovelace's notes. But he devotes a significant portion of his 1950 paper to countering what he calls "Lady Lovelace's objection" and he quotes her verbatim. Her objection, he proposes, is tantamount to saying that "computers can never take us by surprise". Indeed they can, he counters. He believes Lovelace was misled into thinking the contrary because she could have had no idea of the enormous speed and storage capacity of modern computers, making them a match for that of the human brain, and thus, like the brain, capable of processing their stored information to arrive at sometimes "surprising" conclusions. Probably the easiest way to understand what Turing had in mind is to think of the Google search engine. Initially it amazed us simply with its ability to search apparently instantaneously through every word currently on the world wide web. Now you can watch as you type, as it rapidly scans every search it has ever processed, to anticipate what you are looking for and suggest to you the question you might be just about to ask. However Turing came to read Lovelace's notes on the Analytical Engine, he considered her important enough to engage with in print. I like to think that he recognised her as a kindred spirit. She was a mathematically precocious woman, considered scandalous for her unashamed desire to engage in intellectual debate on equal terms with men. Turing was an introverted, mathematically gifted boy whose open homosexuality made his life extremely difficult, and who committed suicide in his early 40s. For both, understanding the intricate mechanisms of the mind was a goal to be pursued tirelessly and passionately, while the trials of the body were as far as possible set aside and ignored. Their encounter does help us to understand the magnitude of Lovelace's achievement. When Turing argued that machines would eventually be able to think, he had in front of him at Manchester University a truly programmable machine, the precursor to the Atlas computer - Britain's first "super-computer". Lovelace by contrast had only the idea of a computer on which to base her equally clear conviction that machines would only ever be able to do what we asked them to. Sixty years after Turing's death, when our mobile phone has 1000 times the speed and memory capacity of the Atlas computer, she has not yet been proved wrong and personally, I'm with Lovelace. But let me end with Turing. In August 1951 he and four friends visited the Festival of Britain in London - that "tonic to the nation" devised by the Labour government to foster British pride and optimism for the future. In the festival's science exhibit in South Kensington they spent some time watching Grey Walter's tortoises. They were not particularly impressed - the tortoises seemed to spend most of their time going round and round in circles - although they did like the way the tortoises responded to their own reflections in a mirror. But this wasn't much fun. They quickly abandoned South Kensington, and went instead to the festival funfair in Battersea where they thoroughly enjoyed themselves. It was one of the few happy occasions in the last years of Turing's life of which we have a record. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>David Moyes always knew that following in the footsteps of greatness was never going to be easy. On the approaches to Old Trafford on Saturday, there was no escaping the shadow, the memory. You can now walk along Sir Alex Ferguson Way, past the vast Sir Alex Ferguson Stand and into the bastion of invincibility that Sir Alex Ferguson built over the course of 26 years. Just to add to it all, Ferguson's highly-anticipated book hits the shelves this week, followed by the tour to promote it, of course. Sales for his night at the Lowry Theatre,  less than a mile from Old Trafford, sold out in four minutes. It all comes as Moyes is attempting to impose his own identity on Manchester United and put his predecessor in the past. It is proving, as we always knew it would, easier said than done. When Ferguson retired, United did not just lose a manager, they lost an aura, an air of invincibility. Ferguson was at Old Trafford on Saturday to watch Southampton score the kind of late equaliser for which his sides were famed. Two minutes before the goal came, Moyes had replaced Wayne Rooney with Chris Smalling. At the final whistle, some questioned whether Ferguson would have done the same, would have been as cautious. Others asked why Moyes was failing to extract the extra 10% which his predecessor's force of personality somehow brought out in lesser players and papered over a number of shortcomings in his squad. United delivered in bursts on Saturday. There were moments when Rooney, Robin van Persie and Adnan Januzaj linked up delightfully but they were too far and few between. It was strange to see Southampton dictate for so long - they had 54% of possession, made significantly more passes both around the field and in the final third and had 18 shots to United's 12. For long periods United were insipid, not inventive. The familiar fluency, that cavalier attacking flair that became a hallmark under Ferguson has been replaced by a caution, an instinct to not lose where once United would do everything to win. 'Throw the kitchen sink in the last 15 minutes', was how Ferguson put it. The only side doing that in the final minutes were wearing black and being driven on by Pochettino. Southampton never looked overawed, they played without fear or fragility. After the game, their manager Mauricio Pochettino was asked if the fear factor around United and Old Trafford had gone. "I have never started a game in a fearful way," he said. "But it was strange for me to come to Old Trafford and not see Sir Alex Ferguson sitting in the opposite dugout. "Last year when I came here I had the chance to meet him, it was great. I am sure it is not easy for David Moyes to be under the shadow of Sir Alex. But I think David is a great manager, a great person." United under Moyes have yet to win back-to-back Premier League matches this season and the champions have failed to win five of their first eight matches, losing at Liverpool, Manchester City and home to West Brom. The Red Devils are not used to being eight points behind the leaders after eight games. It should, of course, be remembered that they have endured a run of games that no manager would have fancied. United have a habit of coming good as the season drags on. At this stage last year, they had lost to Everton and Tottenham. Two years ago, they had been thrashed 6-1 by City. Moyes rejected suggestions that Ferguson's force of personality had been a factor in what has been a difficult start to the new season. "The players are the thing because of the quality," he said. "Obviously Sir Alex Ferguson has a great history and his experience will always work in charge of any team. But the players have always been the people that have to do it on the field." There is not a manager in the world that would have found it easy to slip into Ferguson's shoes. That would have found it easy to continue to drive his players to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat and mount scarcely believable comeback after scarcely believable comeback. There was a sense that teams that snatched the lead knew they had angered United, and were always bracing themselves for the onslaught. Without Ferguson on the touchline, there is a sense that fear has dissipated. And yet, Moyes must take great credit for the good things he has done. The courageous decision to throw Januzaj his first Premier League start at Sunderland two weeks ago paid off handsomely. The 18-year-old made his first Premier League start at Old Trafford against Southampton here, and once again showed flashes of brilliance, creating United's goal and almost scoring a second. Moyes should take credit. Another huge plus for United is the form of Rooney and the way in which Moyes is nursing him gradually back to life. Against Southampton he has bristled with vim and vigour and thumped a thundering shot against the crossbar. Even if the result was disappointing, there were signs that Moyes is gradually turning United around after their worst Premier League start. It will take time and he will be given that but the former Everton manager is taking his first steps down a road of which Ferguson came to know every step, for good and bad. On Saturday, there was no Nemanja Vidic, no Rio Ferdinand. It was a sign of things to come, a sign of the task beyond replacing the irreplaceable, a reminder that this is a squad that - although it won the league at a canter - is also in need of regeneration. That process will not happen overnight. But in the meantime, teams such as Southampton will, rightly or wrongly, come to Old Trafford sensing a weakness. How long that lasts will be down to Moyes. </body>

      <title>Making the case for 'Yes'</title>
      <description>Alex Salmond's speech was droll and pragmatic, says Brian Taylor</description>

      <body>Alex Salmond may have lost a few pounds (he is apparently on the same diet as Beyonce.) However, our newly svelte FM has plainly lost none of his comic timing. The gags themselves were modestly droll but the delivery was impeccable. Admittedly, it was scarcely a tough house. No sense here of the Glasgow Empire on a wet Thursday. They were ready to laugh, they were ready to applaud, they were more than ready to cheer. And they duly did all three. There was, of course, substance too: not least the date on which the White Paper will emerge. This document will form the prospectus upon which people in Scotland will be voting (although, as the UK government points out, independence would require negotiation beyond a Yes vote, plus a Bill through Westminster.) Along with the publication date, we learned a little more about that White Paper. It will have two sections.... Mr Salmond said the aim would be to create both a prosperous country and a just society. And certainly he stressed the importance of enterprise, the need to compete globally. But the substance of his address was weighted towards egalitarianism. For example, the major announcement was about potentially enhancing the minimum wage. In part, this matches the Scottish mood which is traditionally more communitarian. But there is a pragmatic purpose too. For Alex Salmond to secure a Yes vote in the referendum, he needs to recruit votes from the dispossessed and struggling, from Labour voters and those disenchanted with politics entirely. Hence this pitch. On which, one might note the debate earlier today in which delegates agreed to examine the economic proposals contained in the Common Weal paper published by the Jimmy Reid Foundation. The resolution as amended noted that an independent Scotland "may wish to adopt" these proposals. As with other resolutions, this was carried by acclaim. I gather that there had been an expectation that someone would challenge this, suggesting at the very least that the resolution might be remitted. The advice, apparently, was that this would simply provoke division - and draw more attention to the issue than was thought to be warranted. To be clear - and this was stressed by speakers in the debate - the Common Weal prospectus is not SNP policy. However, examination of its content with a view to possible adoption is now a declared party objective. Those who are interested can read the full detail on the Foundation's own website. But, in essence, it argues for a Nordic approach to the economy and social policy: including an emphasis upon equality, the prospect of public ownership where justified and a higher percentage of GDP taken in tax (although it is noted further that wages overall might be higher, resulting in a net gain in living standards.) When I interviewed Angus Robertson for our conference webcast, he was keen to talk about Nordic egalitarianism but preferred to emphasise economic growth rather than higher taxation. Memories perhaps of a "Penny for Scotland", the previous SNP proposal to use Holyrood's Tartan Tax power which failed to enthuse the electorate. More of which later as the White Paper emerges. Back to Alex Salmond's speech. This was a potent performance by an experienced politician on form. It was well timed. Well structured. It featured the now familiar syllogism: Holyrood has produced devolved policies in tune with Scotland; by contrast, Westminster generates policies out of synch with Scottish thinking; turn to full independence. Mr Salmond's opponents, of course, say that is logically fallacious. That there is no automatic read-through from devolution to independence, that the Union remains valid and valuable. On to the White Paper. On to the referendum. </body>

      <title>'A significant blow to Dyke's reputation'</title>
      <description>David Bond on how the FA's latest row is a blow to Greg Dyke</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24593367</url>

      <body>By breaking ranks Heather Rabbatts has delivered the most damaging blow yet to Football Association chairman Greg Dyke's commission on the state of the England team. In a damning letter to fellow board members, Rabbatts complains that she and other directors were not consulted before the first appointments to the commission were announced. But perhaps more significantly she says the make up of the commission does not reflect black and ethnic minorities and says in its present form it is "unsustainable". Ever since he announced the first names on the commission 10 days ago, Dyke has been facing criticism. The first setback was the Premier League's decision not to be represented on the panel. Dyke invited the league's new chairman Anthony Fry - someone he has known for many years - to be on the commission over a coffee in the summer. But Fry, under pressure from chief executive Richard Scudamore, eventually declined. Scudamore told Fry the commission would only duplicate work done in the aftermath of England's World Cup failure in South Africa in 2010. He argued that the Elite Player Performance Plan had only just been launched and that it was too soon to start another inquiry into why the England national team seems unable to match the Premier League's success. The league says it is not snubbing the commission and that it will provide the FA with evidence and support to help it complete its work. But its failure to provide a heavyweight representative has clearly undermined Dyke's marquee project from the very beginning. The second problem - which Rabbatts has made clear in her letter - was the way the commission seemed to be rushed through without proper consultation. The first the FA board knew of the first eight names to be on the commission was just as reporters were being told at the Leaders in Football Conference at Stamford Bridge. Separately, I have been told the names were announced before the commission's remit and terms of reference had been properly considered. Since the Leaders in Football Conference there has been some progress. I now gather that there is a clearer understanding within the FA of what the commission will examine. It will essentially look at the way young English players are developed, breaking it down into three phases. 1. The pathway from schools into academies 2. The progress of those young English players in club academies (ages nine to 16) 3. The development of those young academy players into first team Premier League players The commission will look at where there are blockages and then try and work out solutions. To do this the commission will call on a vast range of data and evidence from clubs, which will be put together by a consultant called Peter Beverley, a former executive with American global management consulting firm McKinsey. The plan is for the FA to compile this data and then present it to the commissioners. It will then be their job to assess the evidence and make recommendations to the board. It was proposed at Wednesday's heated FA board meeting that the commission will produce an interim report before Christmas before publishing final conclusions in March next year. It is an ambitious timetable for such a wide-ranging and deep issue and it risks being derailed completely by Rabbatts's intervention. While there has been some criticism of the names announced so far - Danny Mills in particular - and the lack of a current or recent Premier League manager on the commission, the FA says the make up of the panel is not yet complete. More names could be announced next week. They add that the point of the commissioners is to use their in-depth knowledge and experience of the game to assess the evidence and make recommendations to the FA board. The third and final problem is not including a black or ethnic minority representative on the commission. This is why Rabbatts, whose mother is Jamaican, is so angry. She says it is impossible for the all-white, all-male commission to consider matters of nationality without including someone from the black or ethnic minority community. Kick it Out, the anti-racism campaign group, have written to the FA expressing their concerns, while the former England and Arsenal player Sol Campbell has also been critical. While the purpose of the inquiry is not specifically about race and diversity, Rabbatts and others have a point when they say that any inquest into the way England players are scouted and developed cannot ignore the fact that England is now a diverse, multi-cultural society. One only has to look at the make up the current England team to see that any commission without a current or former black player is a big mistake. Dyke will no doubt try to find someone suitable to join the commission and silence the critics but Rabbatts and others may now accuse him and the FA of tokenism. No-one in football would seriously disagree with Dyke that there is a need to have a proper study into why a country with the world's most widely watched and wealthy football league cannot produce a successful national team. But however one looks at it, the setting up of the commission has been mishandled - and Rabbatts's letter is a significant blow to Dyke's reputation and flagship mission just a few months into his tenure as FA chairman. </body>

      <title>'Electronic blood' computer tested</title>
      <description>A new brain-inspired computing device powered via a liquid instead of through wires has been demonstrated at IBM's Zurich laboratory.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24571219</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70552000/jpg/_70552415_8549310302_50612fbc36_c.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>IBM has unveiled a prototype of a new brain-inspired computer powered by what it calls "electronic blood". The firm says it is learning from nature by building computers fuelled and cooled by a liquid, like our minds. The human brain packs phenomenal computing power into a tiny space and uses only 20 watts of energy - an efficiency IBM is keen to match. Its new "redox flow" system pumps an electrolyte "blood" through a computer, carrying power in and taking heat out. A very basic model was demonstrated this week at the technology giant's Zurich lab by Dr Patrick Ruch and Dr Bruno Michel. Their vision is that by 2060, a one petaflop computer that would fill half a football field today, will fit on your desktop. "We want to fit a supercomputer inside a sugarcube. To do that, we need a paradigm shift in electronics - we need to be motivated by our brain," says Michel. "The human brain is 10,000 times more dense and efficient than any computer today. "That's possible because it uses only one - extremely efficient - network of capillaries and blood vessels to transport heat and energy - all at the same time." IBM's brainiest computer to date is Watson, which famously trounced two champions of the US TV quiz show Jeopardy. The victory was hailed as a landmark for cognitive computing - machine had surpassed man. But the contest was unfair, says Michel. The brains of Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter ran on only 20 watts of energy, whereas Watson needed 85,000 watts. Energy efficiency - not raw computing power - is the guiding principle for the next generation of computer chips, IBM believes. Our current 2D silicon chips, which for half a century have doubled in power through Moore's Law, are approaching a physical limit where they cannot shrink further without overheating. "The computer industry uses $30bn of energy and throws it out of the window. We're creating hot air for $30bn," says Michel. "Ninety-nine per cent of a computer's volume is devoted to cooling and powering. Only 1% is used to process information. And we think we've built a good computer?" "The brain uses 40% of its volume for functional performance - and only 10% for energy and cooling." Michel's vision is for a new "bionic" computing architecture, inspired by one of the laws of nature - allometric scaling - where an animal's metabolic power increases with its body size. An elephant, for example, weighs as much as a million mice. But it consumes 30 times less energy, and can perform a task even a million mice cannot accomplish. The same principle holds true in computing, says Michel, whose bionic vision has three core design features. The first is 3D architecture, with chips stacked high, and memory storage units interwoven with processors. "It's the difference between a low-rise building, where everything is spread out flat, and a high rise building. You shorten the connection distances," says Matthias Kaiserswerth, director of IBM Zurich. But there is a very good reason today's chips are gridiron pancakes - exposure to the air is critical to dissipate the intense heat generated by ever-smaller transistors. Piling chips on top of one another locks this heat inside - a major roadblock to 3D computing. IBM's solution is integrated liquid cooling - where chips are interlayered with tiny water pipes. The art of liquid cooling has been demonstrated by Aquasar and put to work inside the German supercomputer SuperMUC which - perversely - harnesses warm water to cool its circuits. SuperMUC consumes 40% less electricity as a result. But for IBM to truly match the marvels of the brain, there is a third evolutionary step it must achieve - simultaneous liquid fuelling and cooling. Just as blood gives sugar in one hand and takes heat with another, IBM is looking for a fluid that can multitask. Vanadium is the best performer in their current laboratory test system - a type of redox flow unit - similar to a simple battery. First a liquid - the electrolyte - is charged via electrodes, then pumped into the computer, where it discharges energy to the chip. Redox flow is far from a new technology, and neither is it especially complex. But IBM is the first to stake its chips on this "electronic blood" as the food of future computers - and will attempt to optimise it over the coming decades to achieve zettascale computing. "To power a zettascale computer today would take more electricity than is produced in the entire world," says Michel. He is confident that the design hurdles in his bionic model can be surmounted - not least that a whole additional unit is needed to charge the liquid. And while other labs are betting on spintronics, quantum computing, or photonics to take us beyond silicon, the Zurich team believes the real answer lies right behind our eyes. "Just as computers help us understand our brains, if we understand our brains we'll make better computers," says director Matthias Kaiserswerth. He would like to see a future Watson win Jeopardy on a level playing field. Other experts in computing agree that IBM's 3D principles are sound. But as to whether bionic computing will be the breakthrough technology, the jury is out. "The idea of using a fluid to both power and cool strikes me as very novel engineering - killing two birds with one stone," says Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey's computing department. "But every form of future computing has its champions - whether it be quantum computing, DNA computing or neuromorphic computing. "There is a long way to go from the lab to having one of these sitting under your desk." Prof Steve Furber, leader of the SpiNNaker project agrees that "going into the third dimension" has more to offer than continually shrinking transistors. "The big issue with 3D computing is getting the heat out - and liquid cooling could be very effective if integrated into 3D systems as proposed here," he told the BBC. "But all of the above will not get electronics down to the energy-efficiency of the brain. "That will require many more changes, including a move to analogue computation instead of digital. "It will also involve breakthroughs in new non-Turing models of computation, for example based on an understanding of how the brain processes information." </body>

      <body>A study on a Jersey site that revealed a significant piece of late Neanderthal history has been published. Scientists working on an archaeological dig in St Brelade said teeth found at La Cotte suggest Jersey was one of the last places Neanderthals lived. The team of British archaeologists have unearthed items which show the presence of Stone Age hunters at the headland. They said the finds were helping scientists understand more about the early relatives of modern humans. A large portion of the site contains sediments dating to the last Ice Age, preserving 250,000 years of climate change and archaeological evidence. The site, which has produced more Neanderthal stone tools than the rest of the British Isles put together, contains the only known late Neanderthal remains from North West Europe. Dr Matt Pope of the Institute of Archaeology at University College London, who helped lead the research, said: "In terms of the volume of sediment, archaeological richness and depth of time, there is nothing else like it known in the British Isles. "Given that we thought these deposits had been removed entirely by previous researchers, finding that so much still remains is as exciting as discovering a new site." The team dated sediments at the site using a technique called optically stimulated luminesce, which measures the last time sand grains were exposed to sunlight. Dr Pope said the results showed that part of the sequence of sediments dates between 100,000 and 47,000 years old, indicating that Neanderthal teeth which were discovered at the site in 1910 were younger than previously thought, and "probably belonged to one of the last Neanderthals to live in the region". Professor Clive Gamble, from the Natural Environment Research Council, said: "Archaeologists need dates like an artist needs paint. Without a sound chronology the power of our other techniques for probing the past are severely restricted. "This is a great step forward on what looks like being a fascinating journey." The wider project, supported also by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the Jersey Government, will continue to investigate the site and material excavated from it over the past 110 years. </body>

      <title>Vets raise fears over rabies threat</title>
      <description>Scientists are warning that the rabies threat to the UK has increased following changes to quarantine rules.</description>

      <body>Scientists are warning that the rabies threat to the UK has increased following changes to quarantine rules. Veterinary experts and animal welfare groups have told the BBC they are concerned they no longer provide adequate protection against the threat of the disease. "There is enough evidence from people on the front line that the risk has increased as a result of the changes," said veterinary surgeon Prof Sheila Crispin. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) says the risk of a dog with rabies coming into the UK is very low. It estimated the new rules mean there would be one case of rabies in a pet in the UK once every 211 years, with the possibility of a person dying from rabies obtained from a pet once in every 21,000 years. Before January 2012, the Pet Travel Scheme required animals to be microchipped, vaccinated against rabies and then blood tested. After a further six months they would be allowed entry to the UK. But changes to the scheme, aimed at bringing the UK into line with the rest of Europe, mean animals from the EU and approved non-EU countries such as the US and Australia no longer need a blood test and now have to wait only 21 days following vaccination. Under the new rules, it means animals coming from France are treated the same as dogs coming from parts of Eastern Europe where rabies is endemic. Prof Sheila Crispin, former president of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, said the decision to do away with the need for a blood test had also removed a vital check in the system. "For something as important as rabies you really want to know that the vaccine has worked. To wait 21 days and import the animal could be construed as a risk - add to that that the incubation period for rabies can go beyond 21 days and then potentially you have a problem," she says. During 2011, according to Defra figures, 85,774 dogs entered the UK under the Pet Travel Scheme. In 2012, that rose to 139,216 dogs - an increase of 62%. A risk assessment was carried out by Defra before the changes to the Pet Travel Scheme were introduced last year. Prof Crispin says the risk assessment was compiled on the basis that there would be 100% compliance with the new regulations - but that is not realistic, she says. "The trouble is many people have regarded the relaxation as a wonderful opportunity to be dishonest and there's been a huge increase - something like 400% in the first year - of illegal imports, and they are the ones we know about," she says. It is thought the increase is due to illegal smugglers being prepared to run the risk of getting caught, knowing that although they will be liable to pay kennel costs they will get the dogs back after three weeks in quarantine rather than six months. They mostly smuggle puppies into the country because they are easier to sell than mature dogs. Some of the dogs being smuggled into Britain are coming from Eastern Europe, where rabies is found. Animal charities have told the BBC that the quarantine changes, along with the problem of illegal dogs, have left them concerned about the potential risk facing their employees. "The quarantine regulations we have don't reflect the incubation period of rabies. It's not a case of scaremongering, but I think repeating the risk assessment would be a way of doing that, " said Paula Boyden, veterinary director at the Dogs Trust. The Dogs Trust charity is now considering offering rabies vaccinations to front-line staff as a precautionary measure. "At the moment we are monitoring the situation quite carefully. We're certainly considering it," said Paula Boyden. The Dogs Trust is not alone. Battersea Dogs and Cats Home is also in talks over whether to begin offering rabies vaccinations to some of its workers. "We're giving it serious consideration at the moment. It's a three-week wait after the animal has had the vaccination but the incubation period for rabies is anything from two to 12 weeks or even longer, " said Shaun Opperman, veterinary director at the home. In a statement, Defra said: "The risk of a dog with rabies coming into the UK is very low and the risk of rabies being passed from a pet to a person is lower still. "We continue to monitor the situation and will undertake a further, formal risk assessment if we feel that it is warranted." According to Defra, the last case of rabies in dogs in the UK outside of quarantine was in a dog imported from Pakistan in 1970. 5 live investigates will be broadcast on Sunday, 20 October at 11:00 BST </body>

      <title>Blow to multiple human species idea</title>
      <description>The earliest humans from two million years ago in Eurasia and Africa were all part of the same species, a study finds.</description>

      <body>The idea that there were several different human species walking the Earth two million years ago has been dealt a blow. Instead, scientists say early human fossils found in Africa and Eurasia may have been part of the same species. Writing in the journal Science, the team says that Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus are all part of a single evolving lineage that led to modern humans. But others in the field reject this. A team looked at the most complete hominid skull ever found, which was uncovered in Dmanisi, Georgia. It had a small braincase, large teeth and a long face, characteristics it shares with H. habilis. But many features from the braincase were also "unique" to H. erectus. The 1.8-million-year old skull comes from a site that has given up the biggest collection of well-preserved early-human remains known anywhere in the world. The Dmanisi collection also represents the earliest evidence of primitive humans outside Africa, a group that emerged soon after early Homo diverged from Australopithecus, or "Lucy". "We now have the best evidence for what early Homo really is," said lead author David Lordkipanidze from the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi, Georgia. "One of the most important things is that we have such a remarkable collection; it's very rare that you have that from one site." The fossil remains showed a lot of variation that had previously puzzled researchers, but Prof Lordkipanidze said it was clear that these features were all from one population. "When we looked at this variability and compared it with modern humans, you can see this is a normal range of variation," Prof Lordkipanidze told BBC News. The skull was uncovered eight years ago and since then the team has compared it to other Homo fossils found in Africa from as early as 2.4 million years ago. The comparative analysis of the hominid cranium revealed enough similarities for the team to consider the earliest Homo fossils as the same species as the Dmanisi hominids. A co-author of the study, Christoph Zollikofer from the Anthropological Institute and Museum in Zurich, Switzerland, said that if the braincase and the face of "Skull 5" had been found as separate fossils at different sites in Africa, they might have been attributed to different species. "That's because Skull 5 unites some key features, like the tiny braincase and large face, which had not been observed together in an early Homo fossil until now. "Furthermore, since we see a similar pattern and range of variation in the African fossil record, it is sensible to assume that there was a single Homo species at that time in Africa," Prof Zollikofer added. "And since the Dmanisi hominids are so similar to the African ones, we further assume that they both represent the same species." Other palaeoanthropologists, however, believe that at least three distinct species of humans co-existed in Africa. They include Fred Spoor from University College London. He told BBC News that the methods of analysis that the team used were not sufficient to infer that these fossils were the same species. "They do a very general shape analysis of the cranium which describes the shape of the face and braincase in broad sweeping terms," Prof Spoor Said. "The problem is that those Homo species are not defined using such a broad overview of what their general cranial shape is." He added that the very specific characteristics that had been used to define H. erectus, H. habilis and H. rudolfensis "were not captured by the landmarks that they used". "They did not consider that the thick and protruding brow ridges, the angular back of the braincase; and some details of the base of the cranium are derived features for H. erectus, and not present in H. habilis and H. rudolfensis." Chris Stringer at the Natural History Museum in London said that the team had made an excellent case "that this remarkable new skull, with its huge jawbone", was part of the natural variation of the Dmanisi population. But he said he was doubtful that all of the early Homo fossils could be "lumped into an evolving H. erectus lineage". "Only H. erectus survives and becomes successful but at the origin, nature was experimenting with how to evolve humans in terms of increasing brain size," Prof Stringer told BBC News. "Creatures were starting to use tools and eat meat, and this drove evolution, but I think it also drove diversity. The Dmanisi group is an example of the successful species that came out of that and then carried on to spread around the old world." </body>

      <title>'Missing' badgers: call for answers</title>
      <description>Conservationists are calling for an investigation into plummeting badger numbers in the run up to the cull.</description>

      <body>Conservationists are calling for an investigation into plummeting badger numbers in the run up to the cull. The apparent 50% decline over a year before the cull started appears to be unprecedented, data from other badger populations suggests. Government officials have blamed the cold winter, disease or lack of food for the dwindling numbers. But a wildlife charity claims illegal killing of badgers may behind the fall in numbers and is calling for answers. Meanwhile, reports on social networks suggest protestors have been interfering with the hair traps used to assess badger numbers. This could potentially lead to errors in population estimates. There have been three official attempts to count badgers in west Somerset and west Gloucestershire in the run up to the cull. The first estimate - in October 2012 - concluded there were 3,644 badgers in west Gloucestershire and 4,289 in west Somerset. This was revised down in February this year to 3,368 in west Gloucestershire and 2,473 in west Somerset. Then, just before the cull began, a new estimate of the badger population was produced of 2,350 badgers in west Gloucestershire and 1,450 badgers in west Somerset. The data suggests the population in both areas has fallen from around 8,000 badgers in October 2012, to around 4,000 badgers a year later, across both zones. Defra have given a number of reasons for the apparent 50% decline, including the impact of last winter's bad weather, disease and lack of food. "These badger populations go up and down," the environment secretary Owen Paterson said last week. "We're dealing with a wild animal, whose numbers will go up and down depending on weather, disease and other conditions." However, wildlife charities are concerned that illegal killing of badgers may be behind the fall in numbers. Last week, it was claimed that farmers in the Somerset cull zone had admitted to gassing badgers. The wildlife charity, Care for the Wild, is among those calling for an inquiry into the "missing" badgers. Policy officer Dominic Dyer said it was a serious issue and he would like to see more answers from the secretary of state. "A climate has been created which allows certain individuals to believe they can carry out illegal killing and will not get prosecuted," he said. "And I think that has got much worse over the past 12 months, and that's shared by many people in the wildlife conservation movement as well. "I don't think we have got an accurate feel now for what the numbers are - and we are continuing to cull, that is a very dangerous combination." Data on wild badger populations in England is sparse. However, two badger populations have been well studied - at Wytham Wood in Oxfordshire and at Woodchester Park in Gloucestershire. If factors such as poor weather and lack of food are behind the fall in badger numbers in the cull zones, similar fluctuations would be expected in neighbouring populations, say scientists. A Defra report summarising 25 years of population studies between 1982 and 2006 shows rises and falls in the badger population at Woodchester Park over this time period, but not on a level comparable with the fall reported over the past year. Defra has not given recent information on the badger population at Woodchester Park. But a source said that while badger populations at Woodchester Park do show fluctuations, the biggest change year-on-year is about 17%. Prof Rosie Woodroffe of the London Zoological Society has studied badgers for many years, including at Wytham Wood. She said the difference between last year's and this year's estimates of badger numbers in the cull zone was "very large by the standards of normal fluctuations in badger numbers". They "did not see fluctuations of the magnitude claimed for the Somerset and Gloucestershire cull zones" at Wytham Wood, Prof Woodroffe told the BBC. "I think it would be extremely unusual for such a decline to occur through natural causes - especially over such large areas. "Two possible explanations for the difference in numbers relate to problems with the estimation methods (which are rather opaque and have been subjected to interference by protestors), and to the possibility of illegal killing. "I don't think there's any way to distinguish between these two with the publicly available information, but I'd think either was more likely than a natural decline," she added. Robbie McDonald of the Environment and Sustainability Institute at the University of Exeter said it is hard to discern in any wildlife survey the degree to which observed change is due to genuine population change or error in estimates. He told BBC News: "In general, any estimate of a wildlife population comprises genuine change in that population and then error in population estimations. So there's both of those two things." Defra said in a statement that population estimates for Woodchester for 2013 are not available, and it would not be possible to carry out a comparison between Woodchester Park and the cull areas because the sizes of the areas are so different. "Fluctuations in numbers of wildlife populations occur for a range of complex reasons that it is difficult to assess," said a spokesperson. "We are not speculating on the causes for the drop in the badger population." A spokesperson for the NFU said: "The NFU has no evidence of the illegal killing of badgers. The NFU does not condone any illegal activity that results in the killing of wildlife. "Anyone with any evidence of the illegal killing of badgers or any other wildlife should report it to the police wildlife crime unit so it can be investigated." </body>

      <title>Monkeys 'take turns in conversation'</title>
      <description>Marmosets engage in what appears to be "polite conversation", taking it in turns to vocalise, according to researchers.</description>

      <body>Marmoset monkeys take it in turns to "talk" in a pattern very similar to human conversation, according to scientists. Researchers recorded the sounds of the marmosets as they called to one another from behind a curtain. Each animal would call, then wait for the other to respond before calling again. The results suggest an "alternative evolutionary route" for our own conversational turn-taking. They are reported in the journal Current Biology. It is something we take for granted in our conversations, but taking it in turns to talk and listen is crucial for us to effectively exchange information through what we say. Somewhat mysteriously though, we do not see an obvious origin in our closest primate relatives - the chimpanzees. Chimps are not very vocal and tend to use their repertoire of gestures to communicate, so it is widely accepted that these manual gestures provided the foundations for the co-operation inherent in our own communication. But Dr Asif Ghazanfar from Princeton University set out to look for evidence of a vocal route for this co-operation, by looking at vocal exchanges in marmosets. He explained that he chose marmosets precisely because, unlike chimps, they are very vocal. It is one of two main characteristics the monkeys share with humans, Dr Ghazanfar said. "They're [also] co-operative breeders - so they help one another take care of their offspring. "That's an important characteristic because it leads to greater pro-sociality (meaning the animals, like us, carry out behaviours that are intended to benefit others)." The lead researcher, Daniel Takahashi, recorded marmosets calling to one another from opposite corners of a room. The animals were separated by a curtain, so each could hear but not see the other. The recordings revealed that the marmosets would wait for about five seconds after the other finished calling to respond - seemingly following "unspoken rules of conversational etiquette". Dr Ghazanfar explained that there were two ideas for why the animals followed these rules. "One is, if you're out of sight of your group members and want to establish contact with another, you only know if you've established that contact if their response is contingent on your own," he explained to BBC News. "And the other hypothesis is that these calls they exchange might have information content [that needs to be digested]." Dr Ghazanfar says that our own conversational turn-taking might have evolved via a similar route - although on a parallel branch of the evolutionary tree. This provides an alternative explanation to the somewhat "mysterious step" it is suggested occurred as the patterns in chimp-like gestural exchanges evolved into the patterns of our own vocal communication. The team hopes that continued study of the marmosets will help to reveal more about why our own conversation can sometimes break down. "We are currently exploring how very early life experiences in marmosets - including those in the womb and through to parent-infant vocal interactions - can illuminate what goes awry in human communication disorders," said Dr Ghazanfar. </body>

      <title>Uganda seizes massive ivory haul</title>
      <description>Some two tonnes (4,600lb) of ivory is seized in Uganda - one of the country's biggest such hauls for many years, officials say.</description>

      <body>Ugandan officials have seized some two tonnes (4,600lb) of ivory - one of the country's biggest such hauls for many years. The Uganda Wildlife Association (UWA) has said the 832 pieces of ivory could be worth up to $6.7m but other estimates put the value lower. Experts say some of the ivory is believed to have come from elephants poached outside Uganda. There is a huge demand for African ivory in Asia for use in ornaments. The ivory was apparently heading for the Kenyan port of Mombasa. Some of the tusks had been broken up and covered with plastic bottles in crates labelled as material to be recycled. The UWA told the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga that Uganda is increasingly being used as a transit country by poachers who kill elephants in states such as South Sudan or the Democratic Republic of Congo. Uganda is believed to have about 5,000 elephants and this haul would represent the tusks from about 400 animals. Last week, some four tonnes of ivory was found in Mombasa after coming from Uganda. According to the UWA, the rate of elephant poaching is relatively low in Uganda, with an estimated 20 elephants killed for their ivory across the country in 2010. After a sharp fall in the number of elephants in Africa, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) banned the trade in ivory in 1989 But in recent years poaching has increased across sub-Saharan Africa with criminal gangs slaughtering elephants for ivory markets in Asia. </body>

      <title>Amazonia 'ruled' by 227 tree species</title>

      <body>Despite being home to about 16,000 tree species, just 227 "hyperdominant" species account for half of Amazonia's total trees, a study suggests. An international team of researchers found that the region was, in total, home to an estimated 390 billion trees. Writing in Science, they added that the rarest 11,000 species made up only 0.12% of tree cover. However, they added that the new data could help unlock ecological secrets held by the biodiversity hotspot. The results were based on a survey of 1,170 plots and half-a-million trees across the six-million-square-kilometre area, often described as the lungs of the world. The authors said that the underlying cause of the hyper dominance of the 227 species, which accounted for 1.4% of the estimated number of species in the region, remained unknown. "We knew that, normally, a few species dominate ecosystems, but if you have a system that has 16,000 tree species but just 227 make up half of the trees, that was pretty surprising even for us," said lead author Dr Hans ter Steege from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands. He told the Science podcast: "We don't really know why these species are so incredibly dominant because they do not have any particular ecological feature that stands out." In the paper, Dr ter Steege and the team of more than 100 scientists wrote that there was no evidence that two key functional traits for trees - seed mass and wood density - played a part in determining what species dominated the landscape. "The 227 hyperdominant species include both shade-tolerant, typically large-seeded climax species with dense wood and shade-intolerant, small seeded pioneer (species) with light wood," they observed. The most dominant species was indentified as Euterpe precatoria, a palm tree native to central and southern America, with a mean estimate population of more than five billion individuals within Amazonia. Conversely, the researchers noted that the rarest 5,800 species had communities with fewer than 1,000 individuals, adding: "which is sufficient to classify those that are endemic as globally threatened". They suggested further analysis would show that the species identified as hyperdominant would be "disproportionately resistant to pathogens, specialist herbivores and other sources of frequency-dependent mortality". Dr ter Steege said the data could also be used by conservationists to find out what species were found in protected areas, such as national parks, and what ones were located in unprotected areas, and were therefore vulnerable to threat such as deforestation. </body>

      <title>Nepal mountain expansion bid stalls</title>
      <description>Nepal's bid to win international recognition for five 8,000m-plus mountain peaks has failed, the BBC has learnt.</description>

      <body>Nepal's bid to win international recognition for five 8,000m-plus mountain peaks has been put on hold, the BBC has learnt. India and Pakistan could not decide on the matter, causing the plan to stall at the International Mountaineering and Climbing Federation's annual meeting. The tall peaks are appealing to experienced mountaineers; climbing them can make it easier to secure sponsors. Mountaineering makes up a significant chunk of Nepal's earnings from tourism. Winning international recognition for the new peaks would set an important precedent for Nepal because it plans to open several other new peaks in the future to climbers. Some mountain routes, like those leading to Everest's summit, are also becoming crowded, prompting some to call for lesser known peaks to be opened up to climbers. Nepalese authorities had expected the UIAA to recognise the five new peaks during the apex mountaineering body's annual general meeting in Switzerland last week. Three of the peaks are on the world's third highest mountain, the Kanchenjunga massif, two of which are on Nepal-India border and one within Nepalese territory. The two other new peaks are on the Lhotse massif on Nepal-China border near Mount Everest. The highest of the new peaks, Yarlung Khang - also known as Kanchanjunga West - is 8,505m and is in Nepal. All new peaks are within the mountain massifs that already have Nepal's eight highest peaks above 8,000 meters including Everest and are already recognised internationally. Nepalese officials said they had already secured support from China for the five new peaks. "India and Pakistan are also quite positive but they said they needed more time to get this approved by their mountaineering bodies' general assemblies and therefore it could not happen during this meeting," said Ang Thsering Sherpa, past president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association and an honorary member of the UIAA. The UIAA initiated in 2012 what it calls the ARUGA project with an aim to see if new 8,000m-plus could feasibly achieve international recognition. Under that project, Nepal had tabled five new peaks and Pakistan one. "It wasn't possible to decide on this issue without getting the opinion and advice from the involved countries: China, India, Nepal and Pakistan," UIAA Mountaineering Commission President Pierre Humblet told BBC News. "Consequently I wrote to the UIAA member federations from those countries asking them to get in touch with their local authorities too. "I received a fast and positive answer from the Nepal Mountaineering Association and the national public authorities, the Chinese opinion seems to be also in favour of the Aruga project. "But the Indian Mountaineering Foundation and the Pakistan Alpine Club, still in touch with the national authorities, requested more time." The reasons cited for the two countries' indecision are different though. When approached by the BBC to ask if details that it had delayed a decision were correct and if so why, the president of the Indian Mountaineering Foundation, Colonel HS Chauhan, said: "That is one part [of the story] and I will not make any further comment." Knowledgeable sources said the issue was still debated in India and one of the reasons was because the Indian side of Kanchanjunga holds importance in the religious beliefs of the people of Sikkim in northeast India where that part of the mountain stands. Recognising the two border peaks means mountaineering from the Nepalese side would be allowed on them. Pakistani mountaineering officials said they could not decide on the proposal because they had no authority at present. "We were not in a position to decide on our own because during our last government, the ministry of tourism was devolved (to provinces) and now there isn't any authority at the federal level," said Karrar Haidri, member executive consul with the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the country's apex mountaineering body. "We are working on this with the government of Pakistan and hopefully we should be able to decide by the next general meeting of the UIAA." Having already sought international recognition for its own new 8,000m-plus peak on the Pakistan-China border, Pakistani authorities plan to introduce more such peaks. "There will be at least four new 8,000m peaks we will be putting forth for international recognition so there is no reason for us not to support Nepal's move," said Mr Haidri. Pakistan already has five 8,000m peaks, including the world's second highest mountain K2. The UIAA's Pierre Humblet said his organisation's management committee had decided to give up to three months to the Indian and Pakistani mountaineering federations. "Our management committee will then decide about the opportunity to submit the question to the next general assembly," he explained. Mr Sherpa said that if the proposal on the new peaks on Kanchenjunga still remained undecided then Nepal would seek international recognition for only three peaks - Lhotese Middle and Lhotse Shar - on the Nepal-China border and the Kanchanjunga, in the west of Nepal. He said many climbers these days attempt to climb these so-called "side peaks" by using completely different routes from those of the main peaks. "Climbers are doing new adventures, making new routes and accomplishing new achievements and it is our duty to make mountaineering exciting for the new generation," Mr Sherpa. Purna Chandra Bhattarai, Nepal's tourism ministry joint secretary who heads the mountaineering authority of the government: "We believe there are many such peaks in our Himalayas but we need to have a proper survey first. "We are developing a special project towards that end and it will be initiated soon." Mountaineering marked a significant chunk of Nepal's earnings of $360m from tourism last year although officials and mountaineering experts believe that figure can significantly jump if new peaks are opened. Nepalese officials say they are mindful that the addition of the new mountains should not challenge records set by past climbers who have climbed all 14 of the peaks above 8,000 metres worldwide. "It is important to keep a distinction between the historically recognised 8,000m-plus peaks and the newly recognised ones," said Mr Sherpa. "If someone wants to climb all the 14 highest mountains, they must climb the main peaks of each mountain and not the newly identified side peaks." </body>

      <title>Sleep 'cleans' the brain of toxins</title>
      <description>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins of a hard day's thinking, US researchers have demonstrated.</description>

      <body>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking, researchers have shown. The US team believe the "waste removal system" is one of the fundamental reasons for sleep. Their study, in the journal Science, showed brain cells shrink during sleep to open up the gaps between neurons and allow fluid to wash the brain clean. They also suggest that failing to clear away some toxic proteins may play a role in brain disorders. One big question for sleep researchers is why do animals sleep at all when it leaves them vulnerable to predators? It has been shown to have a big role in the fixing of memories in the brain and learning, but a team at the University of Rochester Medical Centre believe that "housework" may be one of the primary reasons for sleep. "The brain only has limited energy at its disposal and it appears that it must choose between two different functional states - awake and aware or asleep and cleaning up," said researcher Dr Maiken Nedergaard. "You can think of it like having a house party. You can either entertain the guests or clean up the house, but you can't really do both at the same time." Their findings build on last year's discovery of the brain's own network of plumbing pipes - known as the glymphatic system - which carry waste material out of the brain. Scientists, who imaged the brains of mice, showed that the glymphatic system became 10-times more active when the mice were asleep. Cells in the brain, probably the glial cells which keep nerve cells alive, shrink during sleep. This increases the size of the interstitial space, the gaps between brain tissue, allowing more fluid to be pumped in and wash the toxins away. Dr Nedergaard said this was a "vital" function for staying alive, but did not appear to be possible while the mind was awake. She told the BBC: "This is purely speculation, but it looks like the brain is losing a lot of energy when pumping water across the brain and that is probably incompatible with processing information." She added that the true significance of the findings would be known only after human studies, but doing similar experiments in an MRI machine would be relatively easy. Commenting on the research Dr Neil Stanley, an independent sleep expert, said: "This is a very interesting study that shows sleep is essential downtime to do some housekeeping to flush out neurotoxins. "There is good data on memory and learning, the psychological reason for sleep. But this is the actual physical and chemical reason for sleep, something is happening which is important." Dr Raphaelle Winsky-Sommerer, a lecturer in sleep at Surrey University, said: "It's not surprising, our whole physiology is changing during sleep. "The novelty is the role of the interstitial space, but I think it's an added piece of the puzzle not the whole mechanism. "The significance is that, yet again, it shows sleep may contribute to the restoration of brain cell function and may have protective effects." Many conditions which lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease are characterised by the build-up of damaged proteins in the brain. The researchers suggest that problems with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to such diseases, but caution more research is needed. The charity Alzheimer's Research UK said more research would be needed to see whether damage to the brain's waste clearance system could lead to diseases like dementia, but the findings offered a "potential new avenue for investigation". </body>

      <title>Air pollution causes cancer - WHO</title>

      <body>Pollutants in the air we breathe have been classed as a leading environmental cause of cancer by the World Health Organization. It said the evidence was clear they cause lung cancer. Sources of pollution include car exhausts, power stations, emissions from agriculture and industry - as well as heating in people's homes. The WHO said the classification should act as a strong message to governments to take action. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a part of the WHO, has now classed air pollution in the same category as tobacco smoke, UV radiation and plutonium. It said air pollution had been know to cause heart and lung diseases, but evidence had now emerged that it was also causing cancer. The IARC said the most recent data suggested 223,000 deaths from lung cancer around the world were caused by air pollution. More than half of the deaths were thought to be in China and other East Asian countries. Rapid industrialisation has led to smoggy skies in cities such as Beijing. However, it is a global problem and concerns about air pollution were raised in Europe again this week. Data suggests there may also be a link with bladder cancer. Dr Kurt Straif, from IARC, said: "The air we breathe has become polluted with a mixture of cancer-causing substances. "We now know that outdoor air pollution is not only a major risk to health in general, but also a leading environmental cause of cancer deaths." Cancer Research UK said it was not a surprise. Dr Julie Sharp, the head of health information at the charity, said: "It's important that people keep the risk from air pollution in perspective. "Although air pollution increases the risk of developing lung cancer by a small amount, other things have a much bigger effect on our risk, particularly smoking." Dr Rachel Thompson, head of research interpretation at the World Cancer Research Fund International, said: "This latest evidence confirms the need for government, industry and multinational bodies to urgently address environmental causes of cancer. "But there's also a lot we can do as individuals to lower our chances of developing the disease such as being more physically active and adopting a healthier diet." </body>

      <body>The number of badgers shot during a six-week cull in Gloucestershire has fallen short of its target, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has told MPs. Defra said 708 badgers had been killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Nigel Gibbens, chief veterinary officer, advised it should be extended. This could be for eight weeks. Badger campaigners have called the scheme a "massive failure" and said they would continue their protest . Mr Gibbens said extending the cull would achieve the "earliest and greatest possible impact" on bovine TB in Gloucestershire. Defra said Natural England was currently considering the application to extend the licence in Gloucestershire and a decision is "expected shortly". Mr Paterson told the BBC the cull figures were "not bad news" but admitted that those carrying out the killings had "got off to a slower start" in Gloucestershire. "We must remember that these are pilots," he said. "This has not been done before and we are learning, clearly, in each area. This isn't a sudden six-week period. These pilots are intended to go on for four years. "Up to to the end of July, a further 20,000 perfectly healthy cattle have been hauled off to slaughter at horrendous expense to the taxpayer because we've lost control of TB." Mr Paterson said 305,000 cattle had been "lost" over the past 10 years and it was "not acceptable" to allow the disease to go on. The badger cull in Gloucestershire ended this week. A licence was granted last week to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November. Defra said early indications from Gloucestershire are that, as in Somerset, the pilot had been "safe and humane". The government's original target was 2,900 badgers, based on a population estimate of 3,400 animals. The target was then revised to 1,650, from a population of 2,350. Last week Mr Paterson said the government was exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB. Stop the Badger Cull spokesman Jay Tiernan said the cull had been a "massive failure". "It's disgraceful," he said. "It clearly isn't safe, effective or humane. "It is time for someone to bite the bullet and admit it's been a failure." Mr Tiernan said protests against the culls would continue. </body>

      <title>Osborne agrees to China nuclear deal</title>
      <description>The Chancellor, George Osborne, announces that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.</description>

      <body>The Chancellor, George Osborne, has announced that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. The announcement also said that Chinese firms might eventually be allowed to take majority stakes in British nuclear plants. Mr Osborne made the announcement on the last day of a trade visit to China. The first China deal could be as early as next week, with the go ahead for a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site. Also on Thursday, a report commissioned for the prime minister warned of a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years. The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits". Supply is expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15. Most existing coal-fired plants are expected to be closed in 2015 to meet European Union pollution directives, while many gas-fired power plants are not being used at the moment because gas is so expensive. These would take time and money to bring back on stream. The Hinkley C project, in Somerset, will be the first new nuclear power station since 1995. Hinkley C's construction will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EDF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs. EDF has been negotiating with three Chinese nuclear giants on the Hinkley C project - CGN, CNNC and SNPTC - all of which have been seen by the chancellor this week. Our business editor, Robert Peston, says he has been told that one or two of these will end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C. A DECC spokesperson said talks about a contract were underway: "Negotiations remain ongoing between the government and EDF on the potential terms of an investment contract for Hinkley Point C. No agreement has as yet been reached. "A contract will only be offered if it is value for money, fair and affordable, in line with government policy on no public subsidy for new nuclear and consistent with state-aid rules." Mr Osborne made the announcement while on a visit to the Taishan nuclear plant in southern China on Thursday which is itself a collaboration between EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG). He said: "Today is another demonstration of the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China, the world's oldest civil nuclear power and the world's fastest growing civil nuclear power." The memorandum of understanding also includes roles for British companies in China's nuclear programme. China has 17 nuclear reactors in operation, which provide about 1% of its electricity production capacity. In the future, Chinese firms might be allowed more than just minority stakes in UK plants. The government said that "over time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes". At the weekend, the Energy Minister, Ed Davey, said he believed that a "massive" wave of investment from China, Japan and Korea would secure UK's power supply into the future. Securing future energy supplies is a major challenge. A portion of energy bills is being diverted to alternative energy investment in wind farms and solar energy. But the government believes that renewable energy sources cannot provide enough power for the country's energy needs. The industry regulator, Ofgem, has also warned of the "unprecedented challenge" to secure power supplies. It said spare electricity power production capacity could fall to 2% by 2015, increasing the risk of blackouts. </body>

      <title>Bee-friendly plants put to the test</title>
      <description>An experimental garden has revealed that the right plants can attract up to 100 times more pollinators, say scientists.</description>

      <body>Researchers have used an experimental garden to put pollinator-friendly plants to the test. The University of Sussex scientists counted the number of insects visiting the plants in their garden. They say their findings show that insect-friendly plants are just as pretty, cheap and easy to grow as less pollinator-friendly varieties. Their results are published in the Journal of Functional Ecology. PhD student Mihail Garbuzov used 32 different varieties of popular garden plants. These included some nectar-rich and highly scented plants he thought would be attractive to insects and some that seemed to be less attractive. While the small-scale study did not produce an exhaustive list of the best plants for pollinating insects, the team says the data has put a number on just how many more pollinators the right plants can attract. Mr Garbuzov told the BBC: "Some of the best plants attracted approximately 100 times as many insects as the worst. "And the plants that are attractive to insects are not more expensive, and they're just as pretty." The researchers wrote in their paper that there was "great scope for making gardens and parks more insect friendly" by selecting the right plants. Tips for insect-friendly gardening are already available from a variety of sources, but the researchers say they are largely based on "opinion and general experience". The aim of this study, said Prof Francis Ratnieks, from the University of Sussex, was to "put that advice on a firmer scientific footing, by gathering information about the actual number of insects visiting the flowers to collect nectar or pollen". The researchers gathered their data simply by visiting each of the patches of flowers every day over two summers and counting the number of insects on the flowers. Their results did lead them to make some horticultural recommendations - they found that borage, lavender, marjoram and open-flower dahlias varieties were very good for insects. The colourfully named bowles mauve everlasting wallflower was also very attractive to pollinators, while the least attractive flowering plant for insects was the very popular geranium. Marjoram, the researchers say, was probably the best "all-rounder", attracting honey bees, bumble bees, other bees, hover flies, and butterflies. Borage was the best for honey bees and lavender and open-flowered dahlias were most attractive to bumblebees. The team put a number of varieties of lavender to the test and found that highly bred hybrids, including some with novel colours - such as white or pink - that have been carefully bred into the plants proved the most attractive to insects. Dr Nigel Raine, from Royal Holloway University of London, commented that with bee populations declining across the world, "we can all give bees a helping hand by planting the right flowers to give them the nectar and pollen they need". "This study highlights that it's important for bee-friendly gardeners to choose what you plant with care," he added. "Gardeners and town planners should think carefully about the mixture of flowers they plant to ensure food is available for a wide range of bees and other important insect pollinators. "It's also important to cater for the needs of the rarer species and provide food at times when there might be fewer wild flowers in bloom." </body>

      <body>Elephants have a mysterious and "tangible energy" according to South African photographer Greg Du Toit. Now after a 10 year quest, his portrayal of this "energy" has been captured in an award-winning photo. Titled "Essence of Elephants", the work has earned him the overall title in this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition. Preparation and passion, he says, were key to achieving the winning shot, taken from just over one metre away. "There was one particular day when a baby elephant raced past right in front of my camera and I was ready. I had to be prepared for that moment," said Mr Du Toit. He took the picture at a waterhole in Botswana's Northern Tuli Game Reserve from a hide (a sunken freight container) that provided a ground-level view. He had been going to the area five or six times a year for 10 years. "I chose elephants because I feel a very special energy and connection when I'm around them," he told BBC News. "But although you feel that energy it's very difficult to translate that into a camera because an elephant is such a big animal and they're not very charismatic, whereas a predator is far more charismatic." Using a very slow shutter speed on a wide angle lens "allowed all that energy to come into my camera" making him able to depict "these gentle giants in an almost ghostly way". To achieve the cool blue hue he attached a polarising filter and set his white balance to a cool temperature. The Wildlife Photographer of the Year (WPY) "means a lot to me for various reasons", said Du Toit, especially because photos were submitted anonymously, putting professionals and amateurs on an equal footing. "In my mind it's one of the last places in the world you can actually look at a wildlife photo and trust that the moment is authentic." Chair of the judging panel Jim Brandenburg said: "Greg's image immediately catapults us to African plains. This image stood out for both its technical excellence and the unique moment it captures - it is truly a once in a lifetime shot." This year's Young Wildlife Photographer of the year is 14-year-old Udayan Rao Pawar from India. His photo was of a fresh water crocodile with hatchlings on its head "kind of resembling a crown", explained Mr Pawar. He crept up on the nestling colony of gharials on the banks of the Chambal River, "When the dawn broke early in the morning I hid myself behind a rock, and when the morning light came I took those images. "I could hear them making little grunting sounds. Very soon a large female surfaced near the shore, checking on her charges. Some of the hatchlings swam to her and climbed onto her head. Perhaps it made them feel safe." Despite conservation efforts, the gharial fresh water crocodile is on the verge of extinction with an estimated 200 mating pairs remaining. "The Chambal River is the gharial's last stronghold but is threatened by illegal sand-mining and fishing", added Udayan. Wildlife photographer and Judge Tui De Roy said the composition and timing of the photograph was perfect. "The mother's gaze seems directed at you, appealing to you to let her live and thrive in peace. This image is beautiful and thought provoking, but at the same time also wonderfully playful, making it a clear winner," he said. WPY is one of the most prestigious competitions in world photography. Organised by London's Natural History Museum and BBC Wildlife Magazine, it is now in its 49th year. Images are submitted anonymously by professional and amateur photographers alike. They are selected for their creativity, artistry and technical complexity and must be submitted as a raw file with no manipulations. The winners beat 43,000 entries submitted from 96 countries.

      <title>Clawed fossil had spider-like brain</title>
      <description>A clawed spider-like creature reveals the most intact nervous system ever observed in an ancient fossil, 520 million years old.</description>

      <body>Scientists have discovered the best-preserved nervous system in an ancient fossil. Dating back 520 million years, the clawed spider-like fossil shows clear evidence of a brain and of nerve cords running through the creature's trunk. The specimen now confirms that the ancestors of spiders and scorpions were related, but branched off more than half-a-billion years ago. A team of international scientists present their work in Nature. The "great appendage" arthropods, are an extinct group of joint-legged creatures with large claw-like appendages - or growths - protruding from their heads. The nervous system tends to be similar between major groups of animals, which helps palaeontologists work out how they are related, explained Greg Edgecombe from the Natural History Museum in London. "The nervous system is one of the more reliable tool-kits we have. We were trying to investigate whether there was evidence for the preservation of neural tissues from very early parts of the animal fossil record," he told BBC News. "What we've been working with is fossils with very fine anatomical preservation from the Cambrian period. These have given us information about brains, the nerve cords and the neural tissue that goes into the eyes." New to science, the fossil was recently discovered in South China and is part of the genus Alalcomenaeus. This group had segmented bodies equipped with about a dozen pairs of appendages which enabled the creatures to swim or crawl. It was placed in a CT scanner and compared with other arthropods in order to understand its evolution. The team then used 3D software to see structures not visible on the surface of the fossil. "People like myself who are mad keen on creepy crawlies want to understand how very strange early arthropods relate to living ones," added Dr Edgecombe. "By having access to the nervous system it allows us to study the evolutionary relationships of very ancient fossils using the same kind of information that we would use for living animals." Co-author, Xiaoya Ma, also from the Natural History Museum, said: "It is very exciting to use new techniques to successfully reveal such a complete central nervous system from a 520-million-year old fossil, and in such detail." She told the BBC's Science in Action programme that the high resolution of the reconstructed image allowed the team to see "the concentrated neural structures in the head region". They could also observe the segments of the brain associated with the claw-like appendages. The fossil belongs to an extinct group of marine arthropods known as megacheirans, Greek for "large claws". To infer the evolutionary relationships between species, the fields of palaeontology and neuroanatomy together. Nicholas Strausfeld was from the anatomy side of the team at the University of Arizona, US. "We now know that the megacheirans had central nervous systems very similar to today's horseshoe crabs and scorpions," said Prof Strausfeld. "This means the ancestors of spiders and their kin lived side by side with the ancestors of crustaceans in the Lower Cambrian." He added that their prominent appendages were clearly used for grasping and holding. "Based on their location, we can now say that the biting mouthparts in spiders and their relatives evolved from these appendages." The team says they expect to find more fossils dating even further back, which will shed new light onto the ancestors of many of today's arthropods. </body>

      <title>Meteorite pulled from Russian lake</title>
      <description>Divers working at a Russian lake have recovered a 570kg chunk of the space rock that exploded over Chelyabinsk earlier this year.</description>

      <body>Divers working at a Russian lake have recovered a half-tonne chunk of the space rock that exploded over Chelyabinsk earlier this year. The object plunged into Lake Chebarkul in central Russia on 15 February, leaving a 6m-wide hole in the ice. Scientists say that it is the largest fragment of the meteorite yet found. More than 1,000 people were injured when a 17m, 10,000-tonne space rock burned up over Central Russia, breaking windows and rocking buildings. Live footage showed a team pull out a 1.5-metre-long (five-foot-long) rock from the lake after first wrapping it in a special covering and placing it on a metal sheet while it was still underwater. The rock broke into three parts as it was pulled from the depths. Once ashore, it was placed on top of a scale for weighing. However, the scale broke as it hit the 570kg (1,255lb) mark. Dr Caroline Smith, curator of meteorites at London's Natural History Museum, confirmed that the object was a meteorite from characteristic features known as fusion crust and regmaglypts, which are obvious in images. She told BBC News: "Fusion crust forms as the meteoroid is travelling through the atmosphere as a fireball. "The outer surface gets so hot it melts the rock to form a dark, glassy surface crust which we term a fusion crust. Regmaglypts are the indentations, that look a bit like thumbprints, also seen on the surface of the meteorite." Sergey Zamozdra, an associate professor at Chelyabinsk State University, told the Interfax news agency: "The preliminary examination... shows that this is really a fraction of the Chelyabinsk meteorite. "This chunk is most probably one of the top 10 biggest meteorite fragments ever found." The divers' mission had been hampered by a number of factors. The rock fragment lay at 13m depth, not 6m or 8m as was originally thought. The Vesti 24 rolling news channel reported that divers had already recovered more than 12 pieces from Lake Chebarkul since the incident on 15 February. The station said that only four or five of them had turned out to be real meteorites. </body>

      <body>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion projects. The Amaze project brings together 28 institutions to develop new metal components which are lighter, stronger and cheaper than conventional parts. Additive manufacturing (or "3D printing") has already revolutionised the design of plastic products. Printing metal parts for rockets and planes would cut waste and save money. The layered method of assembly also allows intricate designs - geometries which are impossible to achieve with conventional metal casting. Parts for cars and satellites can be optimised to be lighter and - simultaneously - incredibly robust. Tungsten alloy components that can withstand temperatures of 3,000C were unveiled at Amaze's launch on Tuesday at London's Science Museum. At such extreme temperatures they can survive inside nuclear fusion reactors and on the nozzles of rockets. "We want to build the best quality metal products ever made. Objects you can't possibly manufacture any other way," said David Jarvis, Esa's head of new materials and energy research. "To build a [fusion reactor], like Iter, you somehow have to take the heat of the Sun and put it in a metal box. "3,000C is as hot as you can imagine for engineering. "If we can get 3D metal printing to work, we are well on the way to commercial nuclear fusion." Additive manufacturing with metal is not new; General Electric, for example, has used the technique to make fuel injectors for one of its aircraft engines. China claims to be using 3D printing to manufacture load-bearing components in aircraft. And in July, Nasa announced that it had successfully tested a 3D-printed rocket engine part. Amaze is a loose acronym for Additive Manufacturing Aiming Towards Zero Waste and Efficient Production of High-Tech Metal Products. The 20m-euro project brings together 28 partners from European industry and academia - including Airbus, Astrium, Norsk Titanium, Cranfield University, EADS, and the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. Factory sites are being set up in France, Germany, Italy, Norway and the UK to develop the industrial supply chain. Amaze researchers have already begun printing metal jet engine parts and aeroplane wing sections up to 2m in size. These high-strength components are typically built from expensive, exotic metals such as titanium, tantalum and vanadium. Using traditional techniques to fashion metal objects often wastes precious raw material. Whereas additive manufacturing - building parts up layer-on-layer from 3D digital data - has the potential to produce almost "zero waste". "To produce one kilo of metal, you use one kilo of metal - not 20 kilos," says Esa's Franco Ongaro. "We need to clean up our act - the space industry needs to be more green. And this technique will help us." Printing objects as a single piece - without welding or bolting - can make them both stronger and lighter. A weight reduction of even 1kg for a long-range aircraft will save hundreds of thousands of dollars over its lifespan. "Our ultimate aim is to print a satellite in a single piece. One chunk of metal, that doesn't need to be welded or bolted," said Jarvis. "To do that would save 50% of the costs - millions of euros." But Jarvis is candid about the problems and inefficiencies that still need to be overcome - what he calls the "dirty secrets" of 3D printing. "One common problem is porosity - small air bubbles in the product. Rough surface finishing is an issue too," he said. "We need to understand these defects and eliminate them - if we want to achieve industrial quality. "And we need to make the process repeatable - scale it up. "We can't do all this unless we collaborate between industries - space, fusion, aeronautics. "We need all these teams working together and sharing." </body>

      <body>Prof Peter Higgs, the joint winner of this year's Nobel Prize for Physics, has promised to retire - once he turns 85. In a BBC Scotland interview, he also revealed that he turned down the offer of a knighthood because he did not want "that sort of title". Prof Higgs said he feels uncomfortable being likened to other Nobel winners. The 84-year-old said this was because his work on the particle which carries his name only took a very short time. He said: "I'm getting the prize for something which took me two or three weeks in 1964. It's a very small amount of my life. "If you take Einstein for the example, his achievements were several orders of magnitude greater." Prof Higgs was born in Newcastle, but developed his theory while working at the University of Edinburgh. His landmark research defined what was to become known as the Higgs boson. Discovering the particle became one of the most sought-after goals in science, and the team of scientists from the European nuclear research facility Cern, who were behind the $10bn Large Hadron Collider (LHC), made proving its existence a key priority. In July 2012, physicists at Cern confirmed the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson. Prof Higgs said he was offered a knighthood in 1999 by Prime Minister Tony Blair but refused the honour. "I thought anything of that sort was premature," he explained, "and anyway, I didn't want that sort of title thank you." "As you know I've recently become a Companion of Honour but that's rather discreet. It's a couple of letters after your name." The physicist retired from full-time teaching 17 years ago but has remained active in sharing his knowledge with other scientists. He now intends to retire "properly" after his 85th birthday. "I'm proposing to retire at the age of 85, next year," he confirmed. "But flying around the world giving lectures is a fairly recent phenomenon because of the build up to this discovery at Cern." </body>

      <title>Apes comfort each other 'like humans'</title>
      <description>Observations of young bonobos reveal that, like children, those more able to manage their own emotions are more likely to comfort others.</description>

      <body>Young bonobos that are more "socially competent" are more likely to cuddle and calm other apes that are in distress, research has revealed. Scientists working at an African sanctuary found that bonobos that recovered quickly from an upsetting experience, such as a fight, were also more likely to comfort others. This mirrors findings from studies in children, and suggests bonobos manage their emotions in a very similar way. The work is published in PNAS journal. The researchers captured footage showing "emotionally competent" young apes rushing to hug other juveniles that were screaming after being attacked. Bonobos are already known as the "empathic apes". Previous studies have documented their responses to others' emotions. Prof Frans de Waal from Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University in Atlanta, said these new results revealed that their ability to console one another was part of this empathy. He added: "It's almost as if one first needs to have one's own emotional house in order before one is ready to visit the emotional house of another. "This is true for children, and apparently also for bonobos." Prof de Waal's colleague and the lead researcher who gathered footage of these ape interactions was Dr Zanna Clay, also from Emory University. She explained that the sanctuary, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, provided a natural setting to study emotional behaviour, because the rescued orphan bonobos there behaved very differently from the apes that had been raised by their mothers. The Olola ya Bonoboo sanctuary is home to many bonobo victims of bushmeat hunting; apes that were taken from their mothers at an early age by hunters. These youngsters are cared for by humans and, after several years of this rehabilitation, they are transferred into a forested enclosure to join a group of bonobos. Watching the bonobos, Dr Clay found that rehabilitated orphans had much more difficulty managing their emotions. After a fight, Dr Clay explained, these orphan apes "would be very upset, screaming for minutes". "Mother-reared juveniles would recover and snap out of it in seconds," she added. The findings, the researchers say, indicate that "the way we develop our social and emotional skills and how we deal with the emotional world around us may be shared with that of our closest ape relatives". Richard Byrne is professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of St Andrews. He pointed out that the term "consolation" implies that we know about the emotion of the apes and their reasons for intervening, which, he said, "is not part of the observed data". "But they are our closest relatives, so personally I would argue that the best guess of their emotions is that they'd be the same as our own in a similar situation." </body>

      <body>Diamonds big enough to be worn by Hollywood film stars could be raining down on Saturn and Jupiter, US scientists have calculated. New atmospheric data for the gas giants indicates that carbon is abundant in its dazzling crystal form, they say. Lightning storms turn methane into soot (carbon) which as it falls hardens into chunks of graphite and then diamond. These diamond "hail stones" eventually melt into a liquid sea in the planets' hot cores, they told a conference. The biggest diamonds would likely be about a centimetre in diameter - "big enough to put on a ring, although of course they would be uncut," says Dr Kevin Baines, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He added they would be of a size that the late film actress Elizabeth Taylor would have been "proud to wear". "The bottom line is that 1,000 tonnes of diamonds a year are being created on Saturn. "People ask me - how can you really tell? Because there's no way you can go and observe it. "It all boils down to the chemistry. And we think we're pretty certain." Baines presented his unpublished findings at the annual meeting of the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society in Denver, Colorado, alongside his co-author Mona Delitsky, from California Speciality Engineering. Uranus and Neptune have long been thought to harbour gemstones. But Saturn and Jupiter were not thought to have suitable atmospheres. Baines and Delitsky analysed the latest temperature and pressure predictions for the planets' interiors, as well as new data on how carbon behaves in different conditions. They concluded that stable crystals of diamond will "hail down over a huge region" of Saturn in particular. "It all begins in the upper atmosphere, in the thunderstorm alleys, where lightning turns methane into soot," said Baines. "As the soot falls, the pressure on it increases. And after about 1,000 miles it turns to graphite - the sheet-like form of carbon you find in pencils." By a depth of 6,000km, these chunks of falling graphite toughen into diamonds - strong and unreactive. These continue to fall for another 30,000km - "about two-and-a-half Earth-spans" says Baines. "Once you get down to those extreme depths, the pressure and temperature is so hellish, there's no way the diamonds could remain solid. "It's very uncertain what happens to carbon down there." One possibility is that a "sea" of liquid carbon could form. "Diamonds aren't forever on Saturn and Jupiter. But they are on Uranus and Neptune, which are colder at their cores," says Baines. The findings are yet to be peer reviewed, but other planetary experts contacted by BBC News said the possibility of diamond rain "cannot be dismissed". "The idea that there is a depth range within the atmospheres of Jupiter and (even more so) Saturn within which carbon would be stable as diamond does seem sensible," says Prof Raymond Jeanloz, one of the team who first predicted diamonds on Uranus and Neptune. "And given the large sizes of these planets, the amount of carbon (therefore diamond) that may be present is hardly negligible." However Dr Nadine Nettelmann, of the University of California, Santa Cruz, said further work was needed to understand whether carbon can form diamonds in an atmosphere which is rich in hydrogen and helium - such as Saturn's. "Baines and Delitsky considered the data for pure carbon, instead of a carbon-hydrogen-helium mixture," she explained. "We cannot exclude the proposed scenario (diamond rain on Saturn and Jupiter) but we simply have no data on mixtures in the planets. So we do not know if diamond formation occurs at all." Meanwhile, an exoplanet that was believed to consist largely of diamond may not be so precious after all, according to new research. The so-called "diamond planet" 55 Cancri e orbits a star 40 light-years from our Solar System. A study in 2010 suggested it was a rocky world with a surface of graphite surrounding a thick layer of diamond, instead of water and granite like Earth. But new research to be published in the Astrophysical Journal, calls this conclusion in question, making it unlikely any space probe sent to sample the planet's innards would dig up anything sparkling. Carbon, the element diamonds are made of, now appears to be less abundant in relation to oxygen in the planet's host star - and by extension, perhaps the planet. "Based on what we know at this point, 55 Cancri e is more of a 'diamond in the rough'," said author Johanna Teske, of the University of Arizona. </body>

      <title>Push for 'smaller' Antarctic reserve</title>
      <description>The EU and US lead a new call for the creation of a scaled down marine protection zone in the Southern Ocean.</description>

      <body>A bloc of countries has issued a joint call for the creation of marine reserves in Antarctica. The group, which includes the US, EU, France, New Zealand and Australia, saw their initial plans thrown out by opposition from Russia earlier this year. But the new plan suggests significant scaling down of one reserve in the hope of securing agreement. It will be submitted to a meeting in Tasmania next week. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), made up of 25 members with interests in the Southern Ocean, has been working since 2005 to establish marine protected areas (MPAs) in the region. At a special meeting in July, plans to establish two giant reserves in the Ross Sea and in east Antarctica were tabled by a number of countries. The Ross Sea proposal, supported by the US and New Zealand, would have banned commercial fishing in an area of 1.6m sq km. The other reserve, supported by France, Australia and the EU aimed to protect 1.9m sq km on the Pacific side of Antarctica. But Russia and the Ukraine questioned the legal basis of the plan that would have more than doubled the size of the world's marine reserves at a stroke. Other countries, including Norway, China and Japan queried the science and the size of the proposed reserves and wanted the inclusion of a "sunset clause", which meant the decision could be reviewed in the future. As CCAMLR operates on a consensus basis, the nations in favour of the plans were forced to withdraw. Now ahead of the Commission's annual meeting in Hobart, the proponents of the reserves have issued revised plans and a call for their adoption. Last month New Zealand and the US published details of a new Ross Sea plan. It cut the size of the reserve by 40% and left a question over the permanence of the arrangement. While the proposal for east Antarctica was also revised, it remains essentially the same in terms of the area covered. "The original bigger Ross Sea plan is now off the table," Paulus Tak from the Pew Charitable Trust told BBC News. "It is now for a smaller area than was originally proposed. They are making the concessions to get the opponents onboard. "Whether that will be a useful move for Russia and the Ukraine who put forward legal objections, remains to be seen." In today's statement, the foreign ministers call on all members of the Commission to support the plans, saying that these regions are "widely recognised for their remarkable ecological and scientific importance". They argue that the proposals before the Commission are based on "sound and best available science and will provide a unique laboratory for marine research, and will have profound and lasting benefits for ocean conservation." However environmental campaigners like Paulus Tak are concerned that the proponents of the MPAs will make further concessions during the meeting. "We call upon the states to maintain the ambition level, and as such each downgrading of the proposal is a matter of some concern from our side, but we want to see a successful outcome of these negotiations." Another issue that could hold up the MPA proposal is the US government shutdown, which could prevent the American delegation from attending. If that happens, the discussion on protecting the Antarctic could be held off for another year. Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>Few children 'connected to nature'</title>
      <description>Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a three-year study from the RSPB suggests.</description>

      <body>Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a study from the RSPB suggests. The three-year project found that only 21% of children aged 8-12 were "connected to nature". Girls were much more likely than boys to be exposed to the great outdoors, while children in Wales had the lowest score across the UK. The RSPB says that a perception among some adults that nature is dangerous or dirty could be holding children back. There has been an increasing amount of research in recent years underlining the lack of contact and experience with nature among modern children. Some have argued that this is having a negative impact on their health, education and behaviour. In 2012, the National Trust published a report on the phenomenon of "nature deficit disorder", though it is not recognised as a medical condition. The RSPB says its new study is the first to quantify the scale of British children's exposure, or lack of it, to the natural world. They came up with a definition of what "connected to nature" actually means and then developed a questionnaire with 16 statements designed to assess the level of connection among children. Some 1,200 children from across the UK were asked to agree or disagree with these statements. Only 21% of children in the UK had a level of connection with wildlife and the natural world that the RSPB believes should be realistic and achievable for all youngsters. This "realistic and achievable" value is based on the average scores of children visiting RSPB sites or who are junior members of the organisation. One interesting finding was the gender difference. While 27% of girls were at or above the "realistic and achievable" target, only 16% of boys were at the same level. "We need to understand these differences," Sue Armstrong-Brown, head of conservation at the charity, told BBC News. "Whether boys and girls are scoring differently on different questions, are girls more empathetic to nature than boys for instance? We need to analyse the data to find that out." The report also highlighted significant regional differences. Only 13% of children in Wales achieved the basic level of exposure, compared with almost twice this number in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The average score for London was higher than the rest of England. Overall urban children had a slightly higher connection than those living in rural areas. According to Sue Armstrong-Brown, the attitudes of adults may be having a significant effect on children. "There is definitely an attitude out there, in some cases, that nature is not perceived as interesting or engaging. In some cases it is perceived as a dirty or unsafe thing, and that's an attitude that won't help a young person climb a tree." The RSPB hopes that its study will be taken up by government as one of the indicators on the state of children's wellbeing. Sue Armstrong-Brown believes that improving the natural connection for children is not only good for the youngsters, it is crucial for the future of nature conservation in this country. "If we can grow a generation of children that have a connection to nature and do feel a sense of oneness with it, we then have the force for the future that can save nature and stop us living in a world where nature is declining," she said.

      <title>Extreme weather 'keeps people poor'</title>
      <description>A new study says that extreme weather scenarios can counter efforts to reduce poverty for hundreds of millions of people.</description>

      <body>New research suggests that extreme weather events will keep people poor in many parts of the world. The authors argue that where disasters like drought are prevalent, they can be the most important cause of poverty. They say that up to 325 million people will be living in countries highly exposed to natural hazards by 2030. If aid is not used to reduce these risks, the progress made in fighting poverty could disappear. The report has been compiled by the Overseas Development Institute. It examines the relationship between disasters and poverty over the next 20 years, using population projections, climate models and estimations of how governments can cope with extreme events. The report suggests that up to a third of a billion people could be living in the 49 countries most exposed to the full range of natural hazards and climate extremes in 2030. In sub-Saharan Africa 118 million people in poverty will face extreme events. The big weather issues that will face most poor people are drought, extreme rainfall and flooding. An analysis of the data from rural Ethiopia and Andhra Pradesh in India suggests that where there is a strong risk of drought, then drought is also the single most important factor in keeping people poor, outstripping ill health or dowry payments. "We've often heard that ill health is the biggest cause for impoverishment," said Dr Tom Mitchell, the ODI's head of climate change. "But in the data, in drought prone areas, the biggest cause is the drought - in areas exposed to these hazards, they are the key causes of impoverishment." Developed countries haven't recognised the role that these extreme weather events have in keeping people poor, he says. The big problem is that, at present, money tends to flow in response to disasters, not to prevent them. Dr Mitchell says the recent Cyclone Phailin in India is a good example. "The very fact that it killed so few people means that the chances of raising big finance for recovery efforts are going to be pretty slim. It has not got the big numbers attached to it," he said. "I think there's a direct link between the ability to raise finance and the number of people killed. It's a perverse incentive." Part of the problem is that donor countries are not prioritising aid at the countries that need it most, in terms of disaster risk reduction. "We've tended to provide much more financial support to a set of middle income countries, who can manage it better like the Philippines, Mexico and Indonesia who made really great strides in protecting their populations," said Dr Mitchell. "What we've not done is focus on the poorest countries, the ones most exposed to issues like drought, for example, sub Saharan Africa, we've almost missed it off." The authors of the report argue that the way that vulnerable countries spend their money needs reforming too. Too often the money is spent on the capital city or on infrastructure and not on the poorest people. The report calls for the post-2015 development goals to include targets on disasters and climate change, to recognise the threat they pose to eradicating poverty by 2030. "If the international community are serious about ending extreme poverty they need to get serious about reducing disaster risk for the poorest people," said Dr Mitchell. "At the moment that's not happening, so the chance of ending extreme poverty is pie in the sky, it is just not going to work." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>Air pollution 'still harming health'</title>
      <description>Some pollutants continue to pose a "significant threat" to European citizens' health and the environment, says a report by the European Environment Agency.</description>

      <body>Air pollution is continuing to damage European citizens' health and the environment, latest figures show. The European Environment Agency (EEA) listed tiny airborne particles and ozone as posing a "significant threat". However, the authors said nations had significantly cut emissions of a number of pollutants, including sulphur dioxide, lead and carbon monoxide. In a separate study, research identified a link between low birth-weight and exposure to air pollution. EEA executive director Hans Bruyninckx said that EU nations had made considerable progress over recent decades to reduce the visible signs of air pollution, with cities now no longer shrouded in blankets of smog. However, he added: "Air pollution is causing damage to human health and ecosystems. Large parts of the population do not live in a healthy environment, according to current standards. "To get on to a sustainable path, Europe will have to be ambitious and go beyond current legislation." The EEA report showed that data suggested that up to 96% of the EU's urban population was exposed to fine particulate matter concentrations above UN World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Even more, 98%, were subject to ground-level ozone concentrations above WHO recommended levels. As well has urban outdoor air quality, the report also highlighted that the natural environment was also continuing to suffer. It said ecosystem were subject to the pressure of air pollution impairing vegetation growth and harming biodiversity." The EEA also produced country-by-country breakdown of air quality data. Responding to the report's findings, Environment Commissioner Janez Potocnik said: "Air quality is a central concern for many people. "Surveys show that a large majority of citizens understand well the impact of air quality on health and are asking public authorities to take action at EU, national and local levels." He added that he was willing to address those concerns in the Commission's Air Policy Review. Infant concerns A separate study, also published on Tuesday, concluded that a substantial proportion of the cases of low birth-weight (less than 2.5kg at 37 weeks of gestation) "could be prevented in Europe if urban air pollution was reduced". The findings, published in the The Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal, said: "The population attributable risk estimated for a reduction in [particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less] concentration to 10 micrograms per cubic metre during pregnancy corresponded to a decrease of 22% in cases of low birth-weight at term." A team of European researchers carried out what they describe as one of the largest studies of its kind, collating data from more than 74,000 births between 1994 and 2011 across 12 European nations. They explained that babies with low birth-weights were at greater risk of mortality and health problems than infants with higher birth-weights. "Low birth-weight has been associated with wheezing and asthma in childhood, and with decreased lung function in adults," they observed but added that there was inconsistency in the findings. "In addition to active and passive smoking, atmospheric pollution exposure is a highly prevalent and controllable risk factor for low birth-weight." Lead author Dr Marie Pedersen from the Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology in Barcelona, Spain, observed: "The widespread exposure of pregnant women worldwide to urban ambient air pollution at similar or even higher concentrations than those assessed in our study provides a clear message to policymakers to improve the quality of the air we all share." Current EU legislation has sent the annual mean limit on fine particulate matter at 20 micrograms per cubic metre for particles measuring 2.5 microns (PM2.5) or less. This is twice the concentration outlined in World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, which recommends an annual mean limit for PM2.5 exposure to 10 micrograms per cubic metre. These microscopic particles (the diameter of a human hair ranges between 15 and 180 microns) end up in the atmosphere from a range of sources, including road transport emissions, and have been linked to heart and lung disease, cancer and premature death. Prof Bruyninckx described the Lancet paper's findings as "very concerning", adding that despite progress being made in some areas, more action was needed to tackle air pollution. "It is the explicit goal of the European Commission to narrow that gap, and in the long run, close that gap because we are... concerned about citizens' health," he told BBC News. But he explained: "Before you make binding legislation, you want to be on absolutely solid ground scientifically. "Now, we know that [particulate matter] is having a significant impact so we need to adjust our rules and regulations accordingly." Commenting on the findings published in The Lancet, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists spokesman Dr Patrick O'Brien said the research was "very helpful in providing further evidence on the potential health impacts of air pollution". But he added: "Exposure to some level of air pollution is unavoidable in day-to-day life and the risk still remains fairly low. "Other factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure or excessive alcohol consumption, may contribute more to the risk of having a low birth weight baby." </body>

      <title>Germany delays CO2 limits for cars</title>
      <description>Germany persuades the EU to delay introducing new limits on CO2 emissions from cars - and angers environmentalists.</description>

      <body>The German government has persuaded its EU partners to delay introducing new limits on CO2 emissions from cars. Environment ministers agreed to revise a deal, reached in July, that set a limit of 95g per km for the average car. That target for CO2 emissions was to take effect in 2020. But Germany, famous for its high-performance cars, says the 95g limit should not take full effect until 2024. Green activists deplored the new delay as a "shameful sop" to polluters. A leading German Green Party MEP, Rebecca Harms, accused Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel of "riding roughshod" over the EU's democratic process, because the 2020 agreement had already been reached between the European Parliament and the Council - the EU ministerial grouping. "Weakening the agreed 2020 limits, which have long been known, is a shameful sop to German car manufacturers and will slow the development of new technologies to deliver more efficient and less polluting cars," Ms Harms said after the ministers' vote. Chancellor Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) are holding talks with the Greens on Tuesday on the possibilities of forming a coalition government. But many analysts believe a "grand" coalition between the CDU and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) is more likely to emerge. The UK was among the countries that supported the German environment minister's position on Monday, German ARD news reports. The German minister, Peter Altmaier, said "it's not a fight over principles but how we bind the necessary clarity in climate protection with the required flexibility and competitiveness to protect the car industry in Europe". Correspondents say there has been intense lobbying by luxury carmakers such as BMW and Daimler, maker of Mercedes, over the EU legislation. The emissions limits are part of the EU's drive to switch Europe to a low-carbon economy and slow the impact of climate change. There is also widespread concern about other pollutants from car exhausts. In a new report, the European Environment Agency (EEA) says more than 90% of European city dwellers are exposed to the most harmful particles in air pollution - PM and O3. Often the particles are transported for long distances across borders, it says. Under the German proposal, the 95g target for CO2 would be phased in - it would apply to 80% of cars by 2020, and then to all by 2024. The ministers' backing for Germany means a revised plan will now be negotiated with MEPs and the European Commission, and a deal may not be reached until after the May 2014 European elections. EU Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard said she was disappointed and rejected the German proposal, Reuters news agency reported. Critics say the delay will undermine investment in greener alternatives, like electric cars and more fuel-efficient engines. </body>

      <title>Warming makes El Nino 'more intense'</title>
      <description>New research says that the El Nino weather phenomenon will be more intense as a result of rising temperatures.</description>

      <body>Scientists say they are more certain than ever about the impact of global warming on a critical weather pattern. The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) occurs in the Pacific Ocean but plays an important part in the world's climate system. Researchers have until now been unsure as to how rising temperatures would affect ENSO in the future. But this new study suggests that droughts and floods driven by ENSO will be more intense. The ENSO phenomenon plays a complicated role in the global weather system. The El Nino part of the equation sees a warming of the eastern and tropical Pacific, while its cooler sister, La Nina, makes things chillier in these same regions. Like water in a bathtub, the warmer or cooler waters slosh back and forth across the Pacific Ocean. They are responsible for rainfall patterns across Australia and the equatorial region, but their effects are also felt much further away. During the Northern Hemisphere winter, for example, you can get more intense rainfall over the southern part of the US in a warmer El Nino phase. For years, scientists have been concerned about how this sensitive weather system might be changed by rising temperatures from global warming. Now, in this new paper, published in the journal Nature, researchers give their most "robust" projections yet. Using the latest generation of climate models, they found a consistent projection for the future of ENSO. According to the lead author, Dr Scott Power from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, global warming interferes with the way El Nino temperature patterns affect rainfall. "This interference causes an intensification of El Nino-driven drying in the western Pacific and rainfall increases in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific," he said. According to Dr Wenju Cai, a scientist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), who was not involved with the study, the paper is "significant". "Up until now, there has been a lack of agreement among computer models as to how ENSO will change in the future," he explained. "This paper is significant in that there is stronger agreement among different climate models in predicting the future impact. "This study finds that both wet and dry anomalies will be greater in future El Nino years. This means that ENSO-induced droughts and floods will be more intense in the future."

      <description>Edinburgh Zoo says its female giant panda, Tian Tian, is no longer expecting a cub.</description>

      <body>Edinburgh Zoo's female giant panda, Tian Tian, is no longer expecting a cub, it has been announced. Experts said her hormone and behavioural signs indicated that she had conceived and carried a foetus until late term, but then lost it. Tian Tian was artificially inseminated in April and had been showing signs of pregnancy for several weeks. However, the zoo said she had now returned to the eating and behavioural patterns of a non-pregnant panda. Chris West, chief executive officer for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said: "Such a loss has always been in our minds as a very real possibility, as it occurs in giant pandas as well as many other animals, including humans. "Our dedicated team of keepers, veterinary staff and many others worked tirelessly to ensure Tian Tian received the best care possible, which included remote observation and closing the panda enclosure to visitors to give her quiet and privacy. "We are conducting a detailed review of the scientific data collected, but I am totally confident that we did everything it was possible to do." The panda enclosure will remain closed until the end of the week to give Tian Tian time to get back into her routine and to give her keepers a chance to recuperate. Keepers insist Tian Tian received the best care possible and remain confident she will eventually give birth. Mr West added: "The majority of research centres and zoos with giant pandas around the world have not successfully bred until the third or fourth year. "What we have achieved, considering we have had giant pandas for less than two years, is immense. "New hormone research is beginning to indicate that lost pregnancies are more common in giant pandas than first thought, though at the moment no-one knows why." The zoo is renting Tian Tian and male panda Yang Guang from China for around £600,000 a year, hoping a cub or cubs would bring in more visitors. Some experts believe money spent on captive breeding would be better used to preserve the habitat of wild pandas. </body>

      <title>Meerkats 'pay rent' to top female</title>
      <description>Some subordinate female meerkats wet-nurse a dominant female's offspring in exchange for not being evicted from the group, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>Some subordinate female meerkats wet-nurse a dominant female's offspring in exchange for not being evicted from the group, a study suggests. Researchers found that females were more likely to do this if they had recently lost pups or had returned to the group following eviction. A group's dominant female aggressively suppresses other females from breeding through infanticide or eviction. The findings have been published in the Animal Behaviour journal. "When dominant females are pregnant, in the last few weeks of the pregnancy they usually throw out the top level of subordinate females," explained co-author Kirsty Macleod, a zoologist at the University of Cambridge. "That can be four or five subordinate females that are really strongly aggressed. "This is because if a female is pregnant herself, she is more likely to kill the pups of another pregnant female in an attempt to try and secure care for her own pups. "In the past, we thought that this behaviour was to try and stop the (dominant female's) pups being killed," Ms Macleod told BBC News that it was much more beneficial for females to belong to a group. "If they are on their own then they have a much more higher likelihood of being predated," she said. "In many cases, these females are evicted and we never see them again, so returning to the group is really crucial to their survival. "What we do see in the wild when they do return to the group is this extreme grovelling behaviour, so we can see that they are quite obviously trying to appease the dominant female. When they start lactating, this seems to fit with that behaviour [pattern]." Damp nipples The idea of subordinate females "paying rent" was based on data gathered from research carried out between 1996 and 2011, during which time scientists observed the behaviour of 40 groups of meerkats. Because most wet-nursing occurred underground in a group's burrows, females were identified as producing milk through the presence of suckle marks and sand being stuck to damp nipples. "Just the sheer volume of data available to me meant that I could look at a lot of different things and fairly definitively make these assumptions, even if it is just short of saying that this is definitely what is happening," Ms Macleod explained. The meerkats in the study are part of a long-term project headed by the University of Cambridge and Professor Tim Clutton-Brock, who is a co-author on the paper. The project, carried out in the Kalahari region of South Africa, also featured in the TV natural history series, Meerkat Manor and a Natural World documentary, to be broadcast on BBC2 (except Scotland) at 2100 UK time. "Wet-nursing by formerly evicted meerkats may be a way of 'paying rent' to be allowed back into the group without receiving further aggression," Ms Macleod observed. She added that researchers had long known about this "allolactation" behaviour among meerkats, with it occurring in almost half of the litters. But, she observed: "In a number of cases, it looks as if they are doing it when they are not pregnant themselves. Physiologically speaking, that is quite a big jump in terms of co-operative behaviour." The University of Cambridge researcher explained that wet-nursing was just one of a suite of co-operative behaviours that subordinate meerkats do. "More common behaviour includes feeding the pups when they are a little older, such as catching a scorpion or other invertebrates and passing it on. "They also babysit as well, so when the pups are very small a subordinate female will stay at the burrow for the entire day, meaning that [the adult is] losing all the benefits of foraging for that day." Ms Macleod said that she planned to carry out further research as part of her PhD research: "What I would like to look at in order to nail this (rent) idea down is whether the females that come back and start lactating are subject to less aggression. "Basically, being a subordinate female meerkat is quite a rough deal because you are in a group and you are caring for another females' young. "Then, if you try to have your own young, you are chased out of the group or your pups get eaten. "So there is this constant and very complex trade-off between the costs of trying to leave the group and have your own offspring against the benefits are being in the group." </body>

      <description>The drugs derived from deadly poisons</description>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <title>China: Opportunity and risk for hi-tech firms</title>
      <description>China a land of opportunity and risk for hi-tech companies</description>

      <body>The UK Chancellor George Osborne said this morning that Britain tends to view China as a "sweatshop on the Pearl River". In reality, he told the Today programme, "it's at the forefront of medicine and hi-tech and computing". An official tweeted a picture of him, headphones on, gazing out at the grey urban landscape of Beijing. To coincide with his visit - and that of science minister David Willetts - a new report calls for China to be seen as a land of scientific opportunity not a black hole of intellectual theft and cybercrime. The study is by Nesta, a think tank founded to promote innovation, and it argues that the massive and growing scale of Chinese science means it is simply "too big to ignore"- spending about $500m on research every day and employing a quarter of the world's RandD workforce. A graphic image of a vast frenzy of research comes from a corporate adviser quoted as describing China as a "boiling cauldron of people just trying stuff". The headline facts are certainly impressive: One key factor identified in the report is the extraordinary size of spending on RandD - about $163bn last year, an amazing 18% increase on the previous year with further rises planned, with science seen as a central element of China's long-term strategy for growth. Measured by the number of patents applied for and secured, China is booming. By 2020, it could be producing more graduates than the US and EU combined. And by the same year, it may be publishing more scientific papers than the US. But of course quantity does not mean quality. The study also notes a recent estimate that only 10% of Chinese engineering graduates meet international standards of employability. So is China really a world leader in science or still a sweatshop? Or a bit of both? The answer is complicated, according to the report. The image of China as a science superpower may be accurate but it is only one of several different ways to view the country: The authors themselves argue that China should be seen as "an absorptive state", assimilating foreign technologies but then adding value and novelty to them. But what about the risks? The report acknowledges a darker side - the fears among hi-tech companies about the theft of their intellectual property. One business leader said "we don't feel ready yet to develop our 'crown jewels' IP in China". But he nevertheless supports long-term engagement there. A related threat is cybercrime - estimated, in a study for the Cabinet Office, to cost the UK £27bn a year. But the authors suggest the dangers may be overplayed, and may be of more concern to politicians than business people. Overall, the report concludes, "the greatest risk for companies is of focusing too much on these downsides, and missing out on the enormous opportunities that China presents", and it calls for far closer collaboration. People who've tried partnerships and have had their ideas or technology stolen may regard that perspective as overly rosy. But a new kind of science gold rush is under way in China - and, as in every rush, there are fortunes to be made, and lost. </body>

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>Can too much rumination be dangerous?</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <title>Why the chancellor wants China to invest in UK nuclear</title>
      <description>Why Chinese power giants are getting stake in UK's nuclear</description>

      <body>Part of what has been holding back the development of new nuclear power plants in the UK is their enormous cost. The government is refusing to finance these hugely pricey projects directly - although it will allow the owners of any new nuclear generators to charge well above the current market price for any power they produce in years and decades to come, so that the billions in development and construction costs can be recouped. The big attraction for the chancellor of allowing Chinese companies to invest in Britain's nuclear industry is that they have deep pockets. On his current trip to China, he has told the biggest Chinese nuclear companies they will in future even be able to own controlling stakes in British power stations, and not just small minority shares. When you think about the history of nuclear power, it may be shocking to some that businesses and investors from Britain - whose scientists and engineers were pioneers in this technology in the early days - will not own the new generation of nuclear power plants, and they may instead belong to China's nuclear power giants (as well as to the French and Japanese). The first of these deals with Chinese interests is expected to come next week, when the formal go ahead is expected for the construction of a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site in Somerset. This project will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EdF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs. I am told that EdF has been negotiating with three nuclear giants, CGN, CNNC and SNPTC. One or two of these is likely to end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C. George Osborne has met the bosses of all three of these companies, to give them comfort that he is keen for them to invest in British nuclear in general, and in Hinkley C in particular. Hinkley C's technology will be French, that of Areva. And the capital, the money, will be French, and - it now turns out - probably Chinese too. </body>

      <body>Studies have claimed major health benefits for standing for much of the day as opposed to sitting. The difference is marked, explains Michael Mosley. Guess how many hours a day you spend sitting? Fewer than eight? More than 10? A recent survey found that many of us spend up to 12 hours a day sitting on our bottoms looking at computers or watching television. If you throw in the seven hours we spend sleeping then that adds up to a remarkable 19 hours a day being sedentary. Sitting down as much as this is clearly bad for us and some studies suggest that those who sit all day live around two years less than those who are more active. Most of us are guilty of excess sitting. We sit at work, in the car and at home, moving only to shift from one seat to another. Even if you exercise on a regular basis that may not be enough. There is mounting evidence that exercise will not undo the damage done by prolonged sitting. Our technology has made us the most sedentary humans in history. So why is sitting so damaging? One thing it does is change the way our bodies deal with sugar. When you eat, your body breaks down the food into glucose, which is then transported in the blood to other cells. Glucose is an essential fuel but persistently high levels increase your risk of diabetes and heart disease. Your pancreas produces the hormone insulin to help get your glucose levels back down to normal, but how efficiently your body does that is affected by how physically active you are We wanted to see what would happen if we took a group of people who normally spend their day sitting in an office and ask them to spend a few hours a day on their feet instead. Standing while you are working may seem rather odd, but it is a practice with a long tradition. Winston Churchill wrote while working at a special standing desk, as did Ernest Hemingway and Benjamin Franklin. So with Dr John Buckley and a team of researchers from the University of Chester we conducted a simple experiment. We asked 10 people who work at an estate agents to stand for at least three hours a day for a week. Our lucky volunteers had mixed feelings about how they would get on. "It'll be different, but looking forward to it, yes…" "I think my feet might hurt - I'll have to wear sensible shoes…" "The small of my back, it's going to hurt…" "I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to stand up for all that time…[Laughs nervously]" We asked all the volunteers to wear an accelerometer - a movement monitor - to record just how much moving about they were doing. They also wore heart rate monitors and had glucose monitors that measured their blood sugar levels constantly, day and night. The evidence that standing up is good for you goes back to at least the 1950s when a study was done comparing bus conductors (who stand) with bus drivers (who don't). This study, published in the Lancet, showed that the bus conductors had around half the risk of developing heart disease of the bus drivers. Since then prolonged sitting has not only been linked to problems with blood glucose control, but also a sharp reduction in the activity of an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, which breaks down blood fats and makes them available as a fuel to the muscles. This reduction in enzyme activity leads to raised levels of triglycerides and fats in the blood, increasing the risk of heart disease. We had good reason to believe that standing would make a difference to our volunteers, but we were also a little anxious as to how they would get on. This was the first time an experiment like this had been conducted in the UK. Would our volunteers stick to it? They did. One woman with arthritis even found that standing actually improved her symptoms. The Chester researchers took measurements on days when the volunteers stood, and when they sat around. When they looked at the data there were some striking differences. As we had hoped, blood glucose levels fell back to normal levels after a meal far more quickly on the days when the volunteers stood than when they sat. There was also evidence, from the heart rate monitors that they were wearing, that by standing they were burning more calories. "If we look at the heart rates," John Buckley explains, "we can see they are quite a lot higher actually - on average around 10 beats per minute higher and that makes a difference of about 0.7 of a calorie per minute." Now that doesn't sound like much, but it adds up to about 50 calories an hour. If you stand for three hours a day for five days that's around 750 calories burnt. Over the course of a year it would add up to about 30,000 extra calories, or around 8lb of fat. "If you want to put that into activity levels," Dr Buckley says, "then that would be the equivalent of running about 10 marathons a year. Just by standing up three or four hours in your day at work." Dr Buckley thinks that although going out and doing exercise offers many proven benefits, our bodies also need the constant, almost imperceptible increase in muscle activity that standing provides. Simple movement helps us to keep our all-important blood sugar under control. We can't all stand up at work but the researchers believe that even small adjustments, like standing while talking on the phone, going over to talk to a colleague rather than sending an email, or simply taking the stairs, will help. I have, of course, written this article while standing. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>The story behind the hidden number 1,729</title>
      <description>Why is the number 1,729 hidden in Futurama episodes?</description>

      <body>The year 1913 marked the beginning of an extraordinary relationship between an impoverished Indian clerk and a Cambridge don. A century later, their remarkable friendship has left its mark in the strangest of places, namely in Futurama, the animated series from The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and physics graduate David X Cohen. GH Hardy (1877-1947) and Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) were the archetypal odd couple. Hardy, whose parents were both teachers, grew up in a middle-class home in Surrey, England. At the age of two he was writing numbers that reached into the millions, so it was no surprise that he eventually read mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he joined an elite secret society known as the Cambridge Apostles. Ramanujan was born in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. At the age of two he survived a bout of smallpox, but his three younger siblings were less fortunate, each one dying in infancy. Although he was enrolled in a local school, Ramanujan's most valuable education was thanks to a library book, A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure Mathematics by GS Carr, which contained thousands of theorems. He investigated these theorems one by one, relying on a chalk and slate for calculations, using his roughened elbows as erasers. Aged 21, he married Janakiammal, who was just 10 years old. Unable to afford college fees and needing to support his wife, Ramanujan got a job as a clerk. Nevertheless, he continued his interest in mathematics in his spare time, developing novel ideas and proving fresh theorems. Curious about the value of his research, Ramanujan began to write to mathematicians in England in the hope that someone would mentor him, or at least give him feedback. Academics such as MJM Hill, HF Baker and EW Hobson largely ignored Ramanujan's pleas for help, but Hardy was mesmerised by the two packages he received in 1913, which contained a total of 120 theorems. Hardy's reaction veered between "fraud" and so brilliant that it was "scarcely possible to believe". In the end, he concluded that the theorems "must be true, because, if they were not true, no-one would have the imagination to invent them". The British professor made arrangements for the young Indian, still only 26, to visit Cambridge. Hardy took great pride in being the man who had rescued such raw talent and would later call it "the one romantic incident in my life". The resulting partnership gave rise to discoveries in several areas of mathematics and Ramanujan's genius was recognised in 1918 when he was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society. The young Indian savant would later say that many of his theorems were whispered to him in his sleep by Namagiri, an avatar of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi: "While asleep, I had an unusual experience. There was a red screen formed by flowing blood, as it were. I was observing it. Suddenly a hand began to write on the screen. I became all attention. That hand wrote a number of elliptic integrals. They stuck to my mind. As soon as I woke up, I committed them to writing." Ramanujan's career was brilliant, but ended prematurely when he began to suffer from tuberculosis. He returned to India in 1919 and died the following year, aged 32. However, the life of Ramanujan continues to fascinate modern mathematicians, including Dr Ken Keeler, who swapped his job as a researcher to join the writing team behind the science fiction sitcom Futurama. He is actually one of a number of mathematicians who write for The Simpsons and its sister series Futurama. They have retained their love for the subject and they continue to express their passion for numbers by smuggling mathematical references into both series. For example, in order to pay homage to Ramanujan, Keeler has repeatedly inserted 1,729 into Futurama, because this particular number cropped up in a famous conversation between Hardy and Ramanujan. According to Hardy, he visited Ramanujan in a nursing home in 1918: "I remember once going to see him when he was lying ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. 'No,' he replied. 'It is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.'" Their exchange can be unpacked and expressed as follows: 1,729 = 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³ It is rare that a number can be split into two positive cubes, and even rarer that it can be split into two positive cubes in two different ways, and 1,729 is the smallest number that exhibits this property. It is in recognition of Ramanujan's comment that Bender, Futurama's cantankerous robot, has the unit number 1729. The number also appears in an episode titled "The Farnsworth Parabox". The plot involves Futurama characters hopping between multiple universes, and one of them is labelled "Universe 1729". Moreover, the starship Nimbus has the hull registration number BP-1729. This has certainly helped keep Ramanujan's memory alive, but it is probably not the sort of immortality that Hardy had in mind when he wrote: "Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do not. Immortality may be a silly word, but probably a mathematician has the best chance of whatever it may mean." Keeler is proud of his mathematical references in Futurama, and he is philosophical about the many years he spent as a mathematician before becoming a comedy writer: "Everything that happens to us has some effect on us, and I do suppose that the time I spent in grad school made me a better writer. I certainly don't regret it. "For example, I chose Bender's serial number to be 1,729 and I think that reference alone completely justifies my doctorate. "I don't know if my thesis advisor sees it that way though." Simon Singh answered readers' questions on Twitter using #AskSimonSingh. Q: What is the second highest number after 1729 and do these numbers have a name? A: Mathematicians tend to focus on what is the smallest number that is the sum of 2 cubes in 3, 4, 5… ways. So 87539319 is smallest number that is the sum of 2 cubes in 3 ways. In "Bender's Big Score" Fry takes cab #87539319. Q: Can you write about Kaprekar's constant 6174 sometime? I think it's better than 1729! A: Not enough space to explain Kaprekar's constant, but I mention Harshad numbers in my book - Kaprekar invented (?) these too. Q: Why does mathematics scare such a large proportion of the public? A: I have a three-year-old son and can see that counting is not a natural process. Maybe the surprise that anybody ever gets maths? Q: I wouldn't say it is rare for a number to be a sum of two cubes, there are infinitely many such numbers. A: Fair point. Q: What is the next big conjecture to be proven? The Riemann Hypothesis? A: Mathematicians seem to rate The Riemann Hypothesis highly. Not something I would ever write about, as it's too complex for my writing talents. Q: What's the next number after 1729 for positive cubes? A: Not sure, but (as you hint) we can look at (-)ve cubes too. Bender's serial number is 2716057, which is 952³ + (-951)³. Q: I see that #AskSimonSingh is due to take place at 16:30BST. Could you reschedule it for 17:29BST? :) A: This is a very good idea. But it is 17.29 somewhere. Q: I don't have a question. I just want to say I really like you as a human being A: Thanks. I guess that is as opposed to liking me as an alien or an amoeba? Q: Why is the number 1,729 hidden in Futurama episodes? A: Many of the writers were mathematicians, and still love numbers, so this is their way of expressing that love. Q: Without computers, how was Ramanujan able to compute properties like the 1729? A: In a way 1729 spot was not miraculous. Many may know that 12³=1728, or 9³=729. Rest is easy. Except it seems that Ramanujan could do this over and over again. Every number was his personal friend.

      <title>Citizen science is the new black</title>
      <description>Are citizen science projects advancing our knowledge?</description>

      <body>Citizen science - the trend for involving amateurs in research projects - is all the rage nowadays but is it real science or just good PR? "This is a blob, nothing too impressive. Oh dear, another blob, these are elliptical galaxies. Ooh look this is a merger..." The Oxford astronomer Dr Chris Lintott flicks through the first of 70,000 images from UKIDSS, the UK Infrared Deep Sky Survey, that have been posted on the Galaxy Zoo website. "This one's a disc galaxy, so this might be what the Milky Way looks like from far away," he adds. The images, which have never been seen before, are part of the latest citizen science project run on the site. All you have to do is look at the pictures and classify the galaxies according to their shapes and features - does it have arms or a central bulge? Is it elliptical? Does the galaxy have a dust lane across the centre? The results should help astronomers to understand how galaxies form, but Galaxy Zoo is just the latest in a growing number of astronomical citizen science projects. The enthusiastic amateur can explore the surface of Mars or the Moon, study solar storms, and even hunt for planets orbiting distant stars. "It's a really exciting time," says Dr Lintott, "citizen science is booming. "That's because astronomers have painted themselves into a corner. They've got really good at collecting data but not so good at processing it. The human brain is still much better at sorting through these images and telling us what we need to know." But it is not just astronomy, citizen science is flourishing in pretty much every field of science. These days you can crunch data on cancer or monitor the spread of ash dieback while playing a simple computer game. You can map the human brain by colouring in neurones, track whales or watch wildlife in the Serengeti all from the comfort of your sofa. The field of natural history has a proud tradition of amateur involvement, and perhaps it is not so surprising to find citizen science flourishing here. According to the Joint Nature Conservation Committee there may be as many as 100,000 amateur naturalists actively collecting and contributing to citizen science projects in the UK - a volunteer effort worth £20m a year. A significant number of those projects are run by the Angela Marmont Centre for UK Biodiversity at the Natural History Museum. Members of the public are encouraged to drop in with specimens, and to access the museum's extensive collections and talk to research staff. When I arrived to meet Dr John Tweddle a fungi workshop was in full swing. "It's exciting actually. You never know who's going to come through the door and what they're going to come with," says Dr Tweddle. "Anyone of any ability can come here to access the collections. Citizen science is really booming at the moment and the most effective projects are actually driving the research agenda. It's really useful science," he added. Of course there is nothing new under the sun. Although he would not have been familiar with the term, Charles Darwin built his theory of evolution by natural selection on the evidence supplied by hundreds of citizen scientists all over the world. Some 15,000 of the letters he sent or received survive at the Darwin Correspondence Project in the Cambridge University Library. Associate director Alison Pearn says Darwin could never have compiled the astonishing wealth of evidence to support his theory without the enthusiastic support of amateur naturalists. "Darwin corresponded with people from all walks of life, plant and animal breeders, gardeners and naturalists, but also diplomats and explorers. He couldn't have achieved what he did without their support. They were eager to contribute to the broadening of knowledge, so it's exactly the same as people do today in what we call citizen science," says Ms Pearn. The computer has added enormously to the power that the amateur can bring to bear on a problem, but interestingly Dr Lintott argues, it is the human brain's unique ability to spot inconsistencies in the vast sets of data scientists have amassed that makes citizen science so useful. "The best and most powerful information processor we have is still the one sitting between our ears. The human brain has a remarkable capacity for pattern recognition, but also for spotting the unusual, for being distracted by something that doesn't quite fit, and that's what we really need," he adds. </body>

      <title>Red destination: Choosing an ExoMars landing site</title>
      <description>Where should Europe's Mars rover try to land?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24466042</url>
      <date>1381536819</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70385000/png/_70385861_vlcsnap-2013-10-09-11h43m13s97.png</thumbnail>
      <body>The search for a suitable site to land Europe's ExoMars rover in 2019 is about to begin. A request will go out in the next few weeks to the scientific community, asking for expressions of interest to join a working group on the subject. Once this panel is in place, planetary researchers will then be invited to a meeting, likely to be in the spring of next year. This will formally kick-off the site selection process, which should take a couple of years to complete. The European Space Agency's ExoMars rover - a roughly 350kg vehicle - is currently in the late stages of its design. Its mission will be to scour the surface of the Red Planet for signs of past or present life. It will have a drill to pull samples up from 2m down, and instruments to assess any organic chemistry that might be present. But choosing the right place to go on Mars is critical to the whole endeavour. "I expect before the end of this month to issue the call to the science community, asking them for letters of interest in becoming a member of the site selection working group," Jorge Vago, Esa's ExoMars project scientist, told me. "We hope this will generate some buzz, and we hope to appoint the working group in November. It will consist of 10-12 external scientists, the project scientists and people from industry. "I would expect by the middle of next year we should have zeroed in on about four top candidate sites to start studying in detail." The scientific community will propose and argue the merits of various candidate destinations; new satellite imagery will be commissioned to inform the discussions. "Best science" will not, however, be the only consideration in making the ultimate decision. There are very important engineering constraints as well. No landing system yet devised can put down on a sixpence; the best you can hope for is a zone of confidence. Even for the brilliant "skycrane" used by the American's Curiosity rover, there was an ellipse of uncertainty that measured 20km by 7km at the final estimate. ExoMars' landing system is being constructed by the Russians and will be reminiscent of the Lunokhod Moon landers of the 1970s. The expected error ellipse will be considerably larger - about 100km by 15km. This means that wherever the scientists might like to go, the engineers will need to satisfy themselves that the rover can actually get there with minimal risk. So, for example, Gale Crater, the current location of Curiosity, would appear to be off the list of potential destinations because the Russian system will not have the accuracy to put ExoMars in this deep hole. The preponderance of slopes and boulder fields will be a consideration. And because ExoMars is a solar-powered rover, it will also be tied relatively close to the equator. So where will ExoMars go? Favoured Locations that lost out for Curiosity's attention are sure to crop up again. If I were to nominate an early runner in the race, it would probably be Mawrth Vallis. This is a favourite among many European planetary scientists, and is the location where Esa's Mars Express Orbiter spied abundant deposits of magnesium-rich and iron-rich clay minerals - a clear sign that a lot of water was once in contact with the rocks over an extended period. To find evidence of life, you must follow the water. Prof Dawn Sumner, who was co-chair of the Curiosity landing site working group, told me: "Mawrth Vallis is a site of exposed ancient martian crust - crust that is likely older than any rocks we've found on Earth. "The rocks there show spectral signatures of diverse hydrous minerals in data from Mars Express and Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. "These spectral signatures, within the oldest crust, make this site attractive, because it provides an opportunity to study the formation and alteration of some of the oldest parts of Mars. "Mawrth Vallis, like most of the ancient martian crust, shows evidence of multiple impacts; it is the high concentration of impact craters that indicates that it is old. "These areas show evidence of multiple fracturing events due to impacts, and the Mawrth Vallis landing ellipse identified as a Curiosity candidate shows many fracture patterns that may be related to various impact-forming events. The fracture patterns vary in the area and may be part of the landing site selection considerations." Wherever ExoMars goes, it will be given an initial mission lasting 218 martian days, or sols. It will get rolling quickly to make the most of the opportunity, and in this past week some of those who'll be involved have been getting a feel for what surface operations will involve. A dummy control room has been set up at the Satellite Applications Catapult in Harwell, Oxfordshire, from where instrument teams have been sending commands to a prototype rover in the Atacama Desert. The boulder fields of this Chilean landscape look just like Mars, and it is cold and dry to boot. Twice a day, the Harwell team has been examining pictures acquired by the prototype, known as "Bridget", and then directing it to various targets to investigate. The commands are sent to the "relay orbiter" (in reality, a support team in the desert), where they are checked and uploaded into the rover. Bridget does its stuff, examining rocks with its "hand lens" and imaging the sub-surface with radar, before returning the data to England to repeat the exploration cycle. "Operations is a very different discipline from design and testing; and you have to get people into a different mind-set," says Lester Waugh from Astrium, the big European space company that is leading the manufacture of the ExoMars rover. "You think very much about risk, because if there is any danger that the rover may be damaged, you have to think very seriously before doing something - because you could lose your mission." </body>

      <title>Can science fiction ever get the science right?</title>
      <description>How accurate is the science in modern science fiction?</description>

      <body>New film Gravity promises to rekindle the debate over how "hard" - or accurate - science fiction should be. Should film-makers adhere to basic scientific principles, or should audiences just feel the magic instead, asks Peter Ray Allison. The relationship between science and science fiction has always been tempestuous. Gravity focuses on two astronauts stranded in space after the destruction of their space shuttle. Since Gravity's US release (it comes to the UK in November) many critics have praised the film for its scientific accuracy. But noted astrophysicist Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, had several issues with the accuracy of Gravity's portrayal of space. Through a series of posts on Twitter, Tyson - who later emphasised that he "enjoyed the film very much" - highlighted various errors. He noted the Hubble space telescope (orbiting at 350 miles above sea level), the International Space Station (at 250 miles), and a Chinese space station could never be in line of sight of one another. On top of that, most satellites orbit west to east, yet in the film the satellite debris was seen drifting east to west. Tyson also noted how Sandra Bullock's hair did not float freely as it would in zero-gravity. This is arguably not so much an error in physics, but a reflection of the limitations of cinematic technology to accurately portray actors in zero-gravity. That is, of course, without sending them into space for the duration of the film. There has always been a drive for scientific accuracy within science fiction, especially within the "hard science fiction" literary sub-genre. But sci-fi, especially in film, tends to have a more flamboyant approach, where realism is often dispensed with in favour of visual flair. The Michael Bay film Armageddon is known for its woeful number of inaccuracies, from the space shuttles separating their rocket boosters and fuel tanks in close proximity to each other (risking a collision) and to objects falling on to the asteroid under a gravitational pull seemingly as strong as the Earth's. More than one interested observer tried to work out how big the bomb would have to be to blow up an asteroid in the way demanded in the movie. Answer: Very big indeed. Nasa is reported to have even used Armageddon as part of a test within their training programme, asking candidates to identify all the scientific impossibilities within the film. Despite the presence of physicist Prof Brian Cox as a scientific adviser on Danny Boyle's Sunshine, artistic licence seeped in. There's a communications "dead-zone" around the Sun - not something easily explicable using real world rules. Despite claims to the contrary, Red Planet was riddled with scientific implausibilities, from the compatibility between modern equipment and 30-year old Russian technology (imagine attempting to connect a modern PC with a Sinclair Spectrum), to the Martian "nematodes" which had been eating algae that had been sent from earth for the past 30 years. The nematodes should have been worms but looked closer to beetles. And there was no explanation as to how they had evolved to eat non-Martian algae nor what they had eaten before. The science across the film was so "creative" that Nasa refused to act as scientific adviser on the film. But perhaps the biggest example of scientific licence occurs in a plethora of space-based dramas. "The most commonly lauded example of 'bad science', intentionally placed into science fiction, is that of sound," says Ed Trollope, spacecraft operations engineer at technology firm Telespazio VEGA Deutschland. "Because space is a vacuum, there is no sound, which means all those explosions and engine noises shouldn't be there." There's a simple cinematic reason for having the sound of an explosion when a spacecraft blows up - it feels right to the viewer. But other conventions are more difficult for scientists to accept. "My pet peeve is inertia," says Trollope. "There are many good reasons for keeping your engines on in space, but 'maintaining speed' is not one of them. If you turn your engines off, you don't stop." Some do it slightly better than others. "I'd prefer not to single out a single film/book/series for this particular error, because it's so common - but I will laud the old television show Babylon 5, for doing a wonderful job of representing the mechanics of spaceflight inertia so nicely," explains Trollope. 2001: A Space Odyssey's silent scenes of space craft, with their rotating Stanford torus design, were closer than many later examples to the reality of travelling in space. "A classic case of scientific inaccuracy was the first edition of Ringworld by Larry Niven, a novel which won both the Hugo and Nebula awards in 1971," suggests science fiction author Charles Stross. "The author inadvertently set up a series of scenes which implied that the Earth spun on its axis in the wrong direction." Niven fixed it in the second printing. The Duncan Jones film Moon was lauded for a reasonably accurate portrayal of what lunar mining for Helium-3 could look like in the future. Helium-3 is rare on Earth but less rare on the Moon, and using an automated method with a human overseer might be possible. But the economics behind the mining is not explained. The alien signal in Contact is a prime example of what Seti (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) is looking for. This is perhaps not surprising as Contact was written by astronomer Carl Sagan. The use of mathematics in the transmission of the message seems reasonable and the time lag in the sending and receiving of the signal is also accurately represented in the film. Science fiction is not just expected to accurately portray science but also to anticipate future developments. "Science fiction hits some predictive targets," says science fiction author Neal Asher, "but rather in the way that a clip fired from an assault rifle will hit some of the enemy hidden in the jungle, but mostly hits trees and leaves." "One of the past criticisms of science fiction has been that it's all 'zap-guns and rocket ships'," suggests Asher. "Now the science fiction writer can smugly point out the LaWs - the US navy laser system - knocking down drones, and then wax lyrical about the X Prize, Virgin Galactic and Elon Musk's SpaceX." Richard Blott, principal consultant at Space Enterprise Partnerships, recalls an early episode of Star Trek ("Spock's Brain", 1968) where the latest space ship is described as having an "ion drive". "Nowadays most new communications satellites have ion engines and they have powered missions to Vesta and Ceres," says Blott. "In the end," Asher concludes, "science fiction is not there to make accurate predictions about the future, it is there to entertain and stimulate the imagination. There is absolutely no doubt that many of the imaginations it stimulates belong to scientists. To some extent it drives and directs science."

      <body>US banking giant JP Morgan is set for a record $13bn (£8bn) fine to settle investigations into its mortgage-backed securities, US media reports have said. A tentative deal is believed to have been reached in talks with senior US Justice Department officials. The fine relates to the sale of securities based on home loans, which led to the near-collapse of the banking system in 2007. If confirmed, it would be the biggest settlement ever paid by an US company. Last month, JP Morgan was fined almost $1bn in the "London Whale" scandal, which arose from huge disastrous bets on the financial markets placed by former bank employee Bruno Iksil. The tentative deal to pay the $13bn fine to the Justice Department was reached during the talks on Friday, between JP Morgan lawyers with US Attorney General Eric Holder and his deputy Tony West, the Wall Street Journal said, citing officials familiar with the decision. The New York Times also reported that the investment bank was nearing the agreement. Neither the Justice Department nor the bank was available for comment. But the reports said that while the fine would settle all civil claims, the US bank would still face possible federal criminal charges being pursued in California or individual criminal claims. The $13bn sum is said to include $9bn in fines and a further $4bn in relief for struggling homeowners. In the run-up to the financial crisis, sophisticated financial products known as mortgage-backed securities were created by many investment banks. These special bonds contained a mix of investments but at their heart were supposed to be risk-free home loans, the BBC's business correspondent Joe Lynam reports. When the housing bubble burst, the value of these assets fell sharply and the credit markets seized up. The balance sheets of many US and European banks, including those in the UK, became toxic and they had to be bailed out by their governments. What JP Morgan is alleged to have done was sell the mortgage-backed assets knowing full well that many of the home loans were in fact very risky. Some of the problems relate to mortgage bank Washington Mutual and investment bank Bear Stearns, two failing firms that JPMorgan took over in 2008. The mortgage-backed assets played a central role in the near collapse of the banking system when banks realised in 2007 that many of their assets were worth a fraction of their official book value. JP Morgan had initially aimed to persuade Justice Department officials to drop the criminal investigation but the attorney general ruled that out, reports said. The bank is not alone in facing inquiries into past practice. In August, US government officials filed two lawsuits against Bank of America relating to mortgage-backed securities. Bank of America denied civil fraud in failing to disclose risks and misleading investors. JP Morgan has found itself overwhelmed by mounting legal troubles lately. Once the darling of Washington and Wall Street, it reported a rare quarterly earnings loss last week, mostly due to legal costs totalling $9.2bn. The bank lost $380m during the quarter, compared with a profit of $5.7bn in the same period last year. JP Morgan says it has set aside a fund of $23bn to deal with mounting legal costs. </body>

      <title>Bank 'has room to raise UK rates'</title>
      <description>The Bank of England could raise interest rates a "fair amount" without hurting homeowners on the Help to Buy scheme, according to one of its policymakers.</description>

      <body>The Bank of England could raise interest rates a "fair amount" without hurting homeowners taking up the government's Help to Buy scheme, according to one of its policymakers. Ben Broadbent, who is on the committee that decides rates, was asked how rate rises would affect those new borrowers. "I think there is a fair amount they could go up before borrowers got into great difficulties," he told Sky News. But he added that a rate rise must not be allowed to "choke off" recovery. Rates would only go up if the economy was in good health - or if inflation was out of control, said Mr Broadbent. "We want to ensure that this recovery continues and is not choked off by a premature rise in interest rates," he told Sky News. Interest rates have been at a record low 0.5% since 2009. A rise in interest rates would mean an increase in mortgage payments for most homeowners, which could lead to a rise in repossessions if people were unable to afford the higher monthly payments. Under the second phase of the Help to Buy scheme, which is now in place, borrowers across the UK can put down a deposit of as little as 5% of the property price. The government provides a seven-year taxpayer guarantee to the lender covering 15% of the loan value. It is available for properties sold for up to £600,000 in the UK. There are concerns that Help to Buy may lead to another housing bubble and borrowers could get into trouble when rates do eventually rise. Mr Broadbent told Sky News that "the numbers entering this [Help to Buy] scheme are relatively low and although interest rates will, as you say, at some point start to rise, it is worth remembering quite how low a level we are starting from." Last week, the Bank's chief economist, Spencer Dale, said that economic conditions are unlikely to improve enough to merit a rise in rates next year. In a QandA on Twitter, Mr Dale said: "Rates will only rise when had sustained period of strong growth as long as no risk to stability." He was also asked how many mortgage repossessions there'll be when interest rates return to long-term average. "Don't know," he replied. "But when we raise interest rates economy should be stronger, higher employment, higher real wages." Mr Dale and Mr Broadbent are two of the nine people at the Bank who set monetary policy. In its last minutes, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it would make no change to the £375bn of monetary stimulus it is providing through its quantitative easing (QE) programme. The programme, brought in to give an extra stimulus because interest rates could barely be cut below the current 0.5%, has been criticised by some for helping the financial markets and the banks, by making money cheap, rather than the economy as a whole. </body>

      <title>RBS decision imminent, says Osborne</title>

      <body>George Osborne expects to make a decision about how to break up the state-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) in "the next two or three weeks", he has told the Daily Telegraph. He said the government - which owns 81% of RBS - was considering hiving off weaker parts into a "bad bank". The decision was "top of his in-tray", the chancellor told the Telegraph. Meanwhile, chief executive Ross McEwan has told staff not to be distracted by speculation on the bank's future. RBS was bailed out for £45bn in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. "We are looking at the case for a bad bank and, if not a bad bank, what is the alternative strategy that really gets on top of the problems in that bank and goes on being what I want it to be which is a bank supporting the British economy," Mr Osborne said. He added that he was considering offering shares to the public in Lloyds, the other major bank in which the state holds a substantial stake. "We are now looking actively at a retail offer for the next tranche of Lloyds shares," he said. But he said the government was not, "at the moment, close to the stage of being able to sell RBS shares". He added: "RBS was a much more complex bank. "To be fair to management past and present, it was a bank that was in a lot more trouble." He said "the clean-up job" had been "more difficult but we have got to make these decisions now about the future for RBS". Investment bank Rothschild has been advising the government on whether the bank's bad loans should be hived off into a separate entity. But in a memo to staff, Ross McEwan - who took over as RBS chief executive at the start of this month - said a bad bank would only affect a small proportion of RBS's overall business. Analysts have said that the vast bulk of RBS's assets are likely to be unaffected by the review. "The truth is, the review and its outcomes are important, but not in the way many people think," Mr McEwan said. "The future of this company will not be about whether we operate in particular areas or where our problem assets sit. The future of this company is about how good a job we do for our customers, including those who are having difficulty repaying their loans. "But the debate you read about in the papers - and that has taken up too much time of the management team - has been about what is now a small proportion of our activity." He said the bank was "taking responsibility for resolving these debates", "Let's address the legitimate concerns shareholders and other stakeholders have," he added. "And then let's get on with building a great bank for customers." Mr McEwan replaced Stephen Hester, who spent four years trying to repair the bank's balance sheet. </body>

      <title>Welby urges energy firm 'generosity'</title>

      <body>The Archbishop of Canterbury has entered the debate about energy prices by urging firms to act with generosity, rather than just maximising profit. In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, the Most Reverend Justin Welby said he understood people who found the latest price hikes "inexplicable". The former oil executive said companies had to "justify fully" their actions. Last week, British Gas followed SSE's rises with a 9.2% increase in its dual-fuel bill price. The archbishop told the Mail on Sunday: "The impact on people, particularly on low incomes, is going to be really severe in this. "I do understand when people feel that this is inexplicable, and I can understand people being angry about it, because having spent years on a low income as a clergyman I know what it is like when your household budget is blown apart by a significant extra fuel bill and your anxiety levels become very high." Amid predictions that the four other major energy suppliers - EDF, E.On, npower, Scottish Power - will now also raise their prices, Archbishop Welby urged firms to be "conscious of their social obligations". He added they had to to "behave with generosity and not merely to maximise opportunity". "They have control because they sell something everyone has to buy. We have no choice about buying it," he said. "With that amount of power comes huge responsibility to serve society. "It is not like some other sectors of business where people can walk away from you if they don't want to buy your product and you are entitled to seek to maximise your profit. "The social licence to operate of the energy companies is something they have to take very, very seriously indeed." The archbishop, a member of the cross-party Banking Standards Commission, previously suggested the City of London has been affected by a "culture of entitlement" at variance with what others think reasonable and hit out at payday lenders charging high interest rates. He said he was concerned that fuel poverty was "a very severe issue... because real incomes are flat or declining and the cost of energy has gone up". "It ties in with the food banks and the debt," he said. "They are all part of the reality of life for many people today." The rise in energy costs has sparked a huge political debate with Labour leader Ed Miliband pledging a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. Prime Minister David Cameron has said he was "disappointed" by the rises but described Mr Miliband's plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. He has said consumers should look to switch suppliers to keep bills down. </body>

      <title>HS2 will benefit UK, says minister</title>
      <description>Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin says the HS2 project will benefit the whole UK, after figures suggested some areas would be worse off if it was built.</description>

      <body>The HS2 high-speed rail project will bring benefits to the whole UK, the transport secretary has said. Patrick McLoughlin was speaking after details of the potential losses that HS2 could cause in about 50 regional economies as calculated by consultants KPMG were revealed by BBC Newsnight. Some of the "losing" areas would benefit from other planned rail improvements, Mr McLoughlin said. He said the project "was controversial, but it was the right thing to do". Speaking to the BBC, Mr McLoughlin said he wanted to see every part of the UK benefit from HS2. "All these investments that we are looking at is to serve the people of the UK, to make the UK a place where we attract investment," he said. "It's of no doubt to me that it's beneficial to the UK. We need to make sure our cities in the north are able to compete with the rest of Europe as well. "HS2 is vitally important overall for the long-term future of the economy." The KPMG report, which was released in September, said the line could boost the UK economy by £15bn a year and listed the regions it said would benefit, with Greater London and West Midlands the biggest winners. But although it included maps showing which areas not on the route could potentially be worse off, it did not include details of the scale of possible losses. KPMG's findings have now been released in a freedom of information request passed to BBC Two's Newsnight programme. According to the research economic output would be worst affected: HS2 Ltd's chief executive has called them "unsurprising". But James Bream, policy director of Aberdeen's Chamber of Commerce, said it was "really disappointing" that such a huge number was left out of the original report. He added the negative impact for the whole north-east of Scotland could be "significant to say the least." Richard Houghton, from campaign group HS2 Action Alliance, claimed the whole project is based on "voodoo economics". He said: "If I was sitting in one of the 50 areas set to lose out to the tune of millions of pounds, I would be asking very clear questions." The chief executive of HS2 Ltd, Alison Munro, said: "What this is showing is that the places that are on the high-speed network... those are the places that will benefit most from high-speed two. "But high-speed two isn't the only investment that the government is making. Over the next five years it is planning to spend £73bn on transport infrastructure." </body>

      <title>Credit union offering 'payday loans'</title>
      <description>A credit union says that more than 6,000 customers have now successfully applied online for its payday-style loans.</description>

      <body>A credit union says that more than 6,000 customers have now successfully applied online for its payday-style loans. London Mutual offers people the chance to borrow between £100 and £1,000 at an interest rate of 2% per month. Borrowers do not have to save with the credit union to apply but they must live or work within one of four inner-London boroughs. Other UK credit unions are expected to adopt a similar model next year. The loans are available on the London Mutual Credit Union's CUOK website. Credit unions are currently limited to charging no more than 2% interest per month, so to borrow £400 over a month would cost just £8 in interest. Customers who want the payment on the same day as they apply have to pay an £11 fee. Borrowers must live or work within four London boroughs - Westminster, Camden, Southwark or Lambeth. They also have to undertake a short psychometric test as part of the application process. The five questions ask borrowers if they tend to obey rules and worry about what other people think of them. Lakshman Chandrasekera, London Mutual Credit Union's chief executive, said the test helped them make lending decisions: "We are trying to find out if you are the type of person who will borrow and not care about not paying. It is useful. There's a correlation between what they say and what their payment patterns are." The whole application process can be finished in under 10 minutes. Mr Chandrasekera said that applicants were given a fast service: "Our online payday loan facility is exactly the same as any other payday loan service. People can apply for the loan, get the decision there and then, and then get the money within a couple of hours." However, the cost of borrowing is significantly lower than commercial payday lenders. Many would charge more than £100 to borrow £400 for a month. Mr Chandrasekera said his credit union also makes careful checks to ensure customers will not struggle to repay the loan: "We are doing thorough checks on affordability, so we will make sure this person can afford to pay the loan." Emma took out a loan for £100 with CUOK last month in order to buy her children school uniforms which she has agreed to pay back over a three month period, costing her just £4.04 in interest: "I'd overspent on holiday with the children. We went through what I had coming in and they worked out what I could afford to pay back. I think within 24 hours I had the money. It was very easy, very straightforward." London Mutual admitted that only one in five applicants like Emma can be approved solely on the basis of the online application process. The other four out of five applicants normally then have to speak to someone over the phone to give additional information. But they would still hope to process the application within 24 hours. Michael regularly used payday loan firms until he discovered he could borrow £400 from CUOK: "Payday loan companies are so aggressive. They also charge about 10 times as much as a credit union. I didn't have to stress." Mark Lyonette, chief executive of the Association of British Credit Unions, says it is important his members speed up their processing of loans but they should still not be too short term: "The sector has just introduced an automated scoring system built on a score card working with the credit reference agencies. We might not be keen on making loans for a 10-day period but we absolutely need to not take 10 days to make a loan." Some industry commentators believe there are strict limits to the extent that credit unions could ever compete with payday lenders. Julian Knight, money editor of the Independent newspaper, says payday lending has grown too big: "They just don't have the scale. The payday lending industry is worth £3m to £4m. It would just be a scratch on the surface." Money Box is broadcast on Saturdays at 12:00 BST on BBC Radio 4 and repeated on Sundays at 21:00 BST.

      <title>Banks 'said Royal Mail underpriced'</title>
      <description>Two investment banks canvassed by government 'warned Royal Mail sell-off price was too cheap'.</description>

      <body>The government ignored two banks that valued Royal Mail at £5bn, far more than shares were sold for, the Financial Times has reported. The government sold 60% of the postal service last week for £3.30 per share, but they soon passed £5. The FT said at least two banks had said shares would be worth up to £5 each. The government said banks' estimates had been made long before fresh factors arose, such as strike threats and financial uncertainty in the US. The government sought opinion from investment banks bidding to manage the sale, and selected Lazard as its independent adviser, before deciding to dispose of 60% of Royal Mail at an Initial Public Offering (IPO) price of £3.3bn. Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Bank of America Merill Lynch and UBS were appointed to lead the sale. Lazard has now been called in by the Commons Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) select committee to answer questions on the pricing after shares had hit 508.3p, before closing at 502.5p. In a statement, a Department for Business, Innovation and Skills spokesman said seven of the 21 banks that pitched in May to act for the government on the sale of Royal Mail were successful. "The proposals included indicative valuations of the company based, in many instances, solely on information already in the public domain," he said. "Banks made their own assumptions of Royal Mail future performance. "The range was wide with the median around £3.6 billion taking into account IPO [initial public offering] discount. The banks appointment process was overseen by Lazard as independent advisers to government. He added: "The banks' proposals came months before any threat of strike action by the unions, financial market uncertainty in the United States and other factors which the government has already said were taken into consideration in setting a price for the company in September." Business select committee member Nadhim Zahawi said he believed the government had got its sums right. Conservative MP Mr Zahawi said he thought the government had acted wisely, given the risks of a flotation. He told the BBC News Channel: "The right thing to do is to bring in as many banks as possible. Ones that work closely with the Royal Mail, ones that advise the government. "When you are trying to get a placing that large away, what you don't want is egg on your face if it doesn't get the investment community excited." He added: "It feels to me that this story is a bit of sour grapes from a couple of banks who weren't very close to the business. "The problem to remember as well is that the government still has a substantial shareholding that at some stage it will want to sell down." Mr Zahawi warned of the danger that could be posed should the government face the prospect of selling its remaining stake at below the launch price and that it would be "far more negative than a successful IPO with shares going up". It was common practice to see government sell-offs priced at around 20% below full value so early investors are not penalised. He said: "Let's look at the share price in six months' time when the froth has gone away when you take out the initial spike and where the shares settle. When you look at comparators ie on dividend on yield on profitability, I think the price was just about right." </body>

      <body>Google shares have topped $1,000 (£617) for the first time, jumping 13.8% on Friday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. Shares in the online giant closed 122 points up at $1,011.4, and have risen 42% since the start of 2013. Friday's share price rise followed the company posting a 36% jump in net profits to $2.97bn for the July-to-September period on Thursday. Google's revenues also beat forecasts with a 12% rise year-on-year. "We are closing in on our goal of a beautiful, simple, and intuitive experience regardless of your device," Google's chief Larry Page said in a conference call with analysts. The strong earnings report also helped other online companies, with Facebook shares adding 4.4% to a new high of more than $55. Amazon rose 3.4%. Google's market value is about $334bn, which is still well below Apple's $461bn. Google was floated in August 2004 at $85 a share, giving the company a market value at the time of $23bn. The company reported its quarterly earnings on Thursday after US markets had closed. Google said that paid-for clicks increased by a quarter during the July-to-September period, from a year earlier, the highest rate of growth in the past year. This offset an 8% fall in average cost-per-click, the price advertisers pay Google when consumers click on their ads. "We view solid paid clicks growth to be a good indicator of demand, driven by the continued shift to mobile," JP Morgan analysts said in a note. Several brokers have raised their share price target for Google on the back of the company's new initiatives to attract advertisers. In February, the company launched a service to help advertisers market through a mix of smartphones, tablets and desktop computers. And analysts believe there is still significant potential to generate revenues from its video-streaming website YouTube. YouTube-branded video-ads surged more than 75% in the quarter from a year earlier, with 40% of traffic now coming from mobile devices. "We estimate that Google's key YouTube asset generated approximately $4bn in revenue in 2012, positioning Google extremely well for the strong growth in video advertising," RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. Analysts at Jefferies said Google is best positioned to benefit from mobile devices with one billion activations of its Android system. Google sells applications and content through its Google Play store. </body>

      <title>Biggest petrol price fall since 2008</title>
      <description>The AA says petrol prices have recorded their biggest monthly fall since 2008, taking the average cost of a litre of fuel to 132.16p.</description>

      <body>The AA says petrol prices have recorded their biggest fall since 2008, taking the average cost to 132.16p a litre. The motorists' lobby group said average petrol prices fell 5.49p a litre between mid-September and mid-October, the biggest monthly fall since prices fell 11.5p in November 2008. The price of diesel has fallen from 142.50p a litre to 139.12p. The AA said lower wholesale fuel prices had prompted the price drop, but warned that further falls were unlikely. The organisation says the recent drop in prices means the cost of filling up the tank of a small petrol car has fallen by £2.74, while a larger vehicle, such as a Ford Mondeo, would cost £3.84 less to refuel. Northern Ireland is the most expensive place for petrol, with an average pump price of £132.9p a litre, and London, the north of England, and Yorkshire and Humberside are the joint cheapest at 131.9p. Scotland is still the most expensive for diesel at 140.1p a litre, while London is the cheapest at 138.6p. Regional variations depend on whether an area is mainly urban - in which case there is more competition - or if it is mainly rural - in which case suppliers have higher transport costs and there is less competition. Overall, the AA says the UK has the seventh-highest petrol price and the second-highest diesel price in Europe. The fuel price data is supplied by the research firm Experian Catalist. The AA said further falls in petrol prices were unlikely, because of poor refinery capacity in the UK and the likely strengthening of the US dollar. The US dollar is expected to rise in value now that the standoff over the country's budget is over and oil is priced in dollars. The AA's president, Edmund King, said: "A more than £2.50-a-tank cut in petrol costs for families is a dramatic improvement on its own. But, heading into winter with cars using more fuel, the timing couldn't be better. "Alongside Asda, Sainsbury's decision to fully reflect the fall in wholesale prices has been a huge benefit for drivers and businesses. "However, the AA is also encouraged by the growing band of non-supermarket retailers challenging the pricing of other supermarkets whose prices in many places are far less generous," he added. The organisation said that the situation at the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland, where a dispute between management and unions has led to a temporary closure, had highlighted the UK's lack of refinery capacity. It urged the government to find ways to support domestic refineries. </body>

      <title>East Coast rail 'sales pitch leaked'</title>

      <body>A rail union claims to have obtained a leaked copy of a prospectus for the privatisation of the East Coast Main Line. The RMT says the document shows the government is playing down the success of the line under public ownership to "bulldoze" the sale of it through. The East Coast line was taken back into public hands in 2009 when National Express handed back the franchise. The government said the RMT was "scaremongering". But the RMT says the leaked prospectus showed the government was engaged in a "systematic and politically motivated devaluation of the performance" of the line, which is due to return to private hands in 2015. The document appears to be a draft version of the final sale brochure for potential investors, with handwritten notes and revisions in the margin. It is intended for "investment professionals only" and not for wider circulation, the text warns. The union claims a paragraph noting the line "three percentage points ahead of the long-distance train operator average" in the 2012 National Passenger Survey had been deleted. A comment on the document also referred to avoiding "references to competitors", the union claimed. "The crucial commentary that East Coast is not only ahead of Virgin and First Great Western - the other inter-city franchise holders - but that East Coast under public ownership is also amongst the highest performers in Europe for passengers per mile had been redacted," the union added. RMT general secretary Bob Crow said: "This leaked document, coming on the day of union protests at Parliament aimed at keeping the East Coast in public ownership, is political dynamite which blows the lid off the lengths to which the government are prepared to go to bulldoze through reprivatisation before the next election. "The fact that the public option is putting over £1bn back into the Treasury, while improving services and delivering more capacity, has been cynically airbrushed out of the final document in a disgraceful piece of political chicanery which must be called in for scrutiny to hold back this full-tilt dash for privatisation." The union also said the document redacts sections highlighting the good punctuality and performance of the service under public ownership. But a Department for Transport spokesman said: "This is ill informed scaremongering from the RMT. "By choosing to release inaccurate information, they are misleading the public. We have no intention of requiring a 'third class' service, reducing performance levels, or in any way devaluing this vital railway. "As the independent Brown Review concluded, franchising works for passengers and taxpayers alike. " Labour says services can be run just as well under public ownership. Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said: "East Coast is working well and will have returned £800m to the taxpayer by the end of this financial year. "This government has learned nothing from the West Coast franchising fiasco, which saw over £50m of taxpayers' money wasted in compensation to train companies, through ministers' incompetence." </body>

      <title>Fire burns tonnes of sugar in Brazil</title>
      <description>A fire in Brazil's largest port burns some 180,000 tonnes of raw sugar and pushes world prices to a one-year high.</description>

      <body>A fire in Brazil's largest port has burnt some 180,000 tonnes of raw sugar, damaging six warehouses and pushing international prices to a one-year high. The authorities in the port of Santos said it took six hours to bring the fire under control. The cause of the blaze is still being investigated. Brazil is the world's main sugar exporter, accounting for nearly half of international sales. The terminal affected by the fire belongs to Brazilian sugar giant Copersucar. Four other sugar terminals are operating normally, port authorities said. Analysts say Brazil has enough port capacity to carry on with its usual export levels. "International markets react because they know there will be a temporary drop. But other terminals will certainly make up for the accident," sugar market analyst Plinio Nastari told Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper. Sugar prices in New York future markets went up by 6% when news of the fire broke, dropping later in the day. Port authorities said that the fire began at around 06:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on a conveyor belt taking raw sugar into one of the warehouses. They say this is the biggest fire in the history of the port of Santos, which exported 12.8 million tonnes of sugar in the first eight months of the year. The port is located some 80km (50 miles) from Sao Paulo. It was the gateway for much of Brazil's coffee exports in the 19th and 20th century and also the main point of entry for millions of European immigrants who arrived in Brazil until the 1950s. </body>

      <title>China's economic growth speeds up</title>
      <description>China's economic growth picks up pace in the July-to-September period according to officials figures - the first rise in three quarters.</description>

      <body>China's economic growth picked up pace in the July-to-September period, the first rise in three quarters. The world's second-biggest economy grew 7.8% from a year earlier, up from 7.5% expansion in the previous quarter. The official figures also showed growth in industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment. After years of blistering growth, China has seen its pace of expansion slow recently and there have been fears that growth may slow further. China has set a growth target of 7.5% for the year. Analysts said the latest numbers indicated that it was likely that Beijing would meet this. "This is an indication that China's economic growth is holding up in a range which is within the comfort zone of both the Chinese policymakers as well as global watchers," said Song Seng Wun, a senior economist with CIMB Research . Over the past few decades China has relied heavily on its exports and manufacturing sectors as well as government-led infrastructure spending to help boost growth. However, a slowdown in key markets such as the US and Europe has hurt demand for its exports. As a result, it has been trying to spur domestic demand to offset the decline in foreign sales and also to rebalance its growth. Earlier this year, it unveiled fresh measures to help boost the economy. From 1 August, China has suspend value-added tax (VAT) and turnover tax for small businesses with monthly sales of less than 20,000 yuan ($3,257; £2,125). The cabinet said the move would benefit more than six million small companies and boost employment and income for millions of people. Policymakers said they would also implement measures to simplify customs clearance procedures, cut operational fees and facilitate the exports of small and medium-sized private enterprises. The cabinet also announced plans to completely open China's railway construction market to private investors to develop the sector further. It said it would set up a railway development fund, with the initial money coming from the government. Analysts said the moves were starting to have an impact on the growth numbers. "There is certainly a build up of momentum among the small manufacturers, which is an indication that China's policies targeted at them are working," said Tony Nash, vice-president at IHS. Factory output rose 10.2% in September, from a year earlier. Meanwhile, retail sales rose 13.3% and fixed asset investment jumped 20.2% during the month from levels a year ago. Tim Condon of ING added that the measures may help China sustain its growth rate in the current quarter as well. "The mini-stimulus we've seen is enough to keep it going at this pace in the fourth quarter," Mr Condon said. However, there have been some concerns over whether the economic rebound is sustainable in the long run, not least due to the continued rise in property prices. Property prices have now risen for eight months in a row, despite government efforts to cool the market. Some analysts have said that China's new leaders, who took charge in March, have so far tolerated the price rises due to concerns over slowing economic growth. According to some estimates, about 25% of overall investment in China goes towards property, making it one of the most important growth sectors. But the continued surge in prices has fanned fears that asset bubbles may be forming. "Between real estate and the lending environment, there are concerns that things may be heating up," said Mr Nash of IHS. "If not addressed properly, and in time, it could pose a serious threat to China's growth." Analysts said that with growth rebounding, Beijing may take measures to try and curb speculation in the property market. "We think the recovery in the third quarter was mainly driven by the strong momentum of the property market," said Shen Jianguang, chief China economist with Mizuho Securities in Hong Kong. "The government concerns about an over-heated property market are increasing, and tougher measures to curb rising prices may be forthcoming. "We expect gross domestic product (GDP) growth will slow to 7.6% in the fourth quarter," he added. </body>

      <title>Private rents 'hit record high'</title>
      <description>The cost of renting a home privately across England and Wales has reached a record high of £757 a month, according to a survey.</description>

      <body>The average cost of renting a home privately across England and Wales has reached a record high of £757 a month, according to a survey. Average rents rose by 2.1% in September compared with the same month a year earlier, LSL Property Services said. This was a 1.8% increase on August, driven by a 3.3% rise in the south east of England. The figures come as mortgage lenders reported another strong month in September, after a summer flurry. LSL said that greater demand from tenants was pushing up rental prices. "Higher rents in almost every region show that, despite government schemes, buying a first home is still a difficult aspiration," said David Newnes, director of LSL, which owns estate agents Reeds Rains and Your Move. "This is not only down to low salary growth, but also a general shortage of supply - which is the underlying reason why homes are getting more expensive. The long-term trend to renting therefore looks unlikely to change significantly in the near future." The government has brought forward its Help to Buy scheme, which aims to assist those who can afford mortgage payments, but struggle to raise the necessary deposit to secure a mortgage and purchase a home. However, critics have said that the scheme could create a housing market bubble, with official statistics suggesting UK house prices are already at a record high. Figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), also published on Friday, showed that mortgage lending for house purchases continued its summer strength. Gross mortgage lending in the UK stood at £16.2bn in September, slightly below lending of £16.4bn in August, but 41% higher than lending of £11.5bn in September last year. "Indicators suggest we are witnessing the strongest house purchase performance in five years. House prices too have revived but modestly, aside from a resurgent London market," said CML chief economist Bob Pannell. The LSL survey suggested that tenants' finances were stretched. Some 8.5% of all rent across England and Wales was late in September, up from 7.8% in August. However, the annual rise in rental costs was still slower than the general increase in the cost of living, with the Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation at 2.7% in September. </body>

      <title>Bank says rate rise unlikely in 2014</title>
      <description>The Bank of England's chief economist Spencer Dale says economic conditions are unlikely to improve enough to merit a rate rise next year.</description>

      <body>The Bank of England's chief economist, Spencer Dale, says economic conditions are unlikely to improve enough to merit a rise in interest rates next year. In a question and answer session on the social network Twitter, he said the UK would need to see sustained growth before rates rose from the 0.5% level. Earlier this week he said that rates could rise in 2014 if conditions were strong enough. Mr Dale is one of the nine people at the Bank that set monetary policy. As might be expected from a central banker, Mr Dale gave little in the way of surprises in his answers on current monetary policy. In its latest minutes, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it would make no change to the £375bn of monetary stimulus it is providing through its quantitative easing (QE) programme. The programme, brought in to give an extra stimulus because interest rates could barely be cut below the current record low of 0.5%, has been criticised by some for helping the financial markets and the banks, by making money cheap, rather than the economy as a whole. Many questioners wanted to know about QE. Asked "is Quantitative Easing a necessary evil? What will be the implications on the UK's macroeconomic objectives?", Mr Dale replied:"QE not evil. Has helped to support economy and protect jobs." Another of the big economic debates in the country is whether or not house prices are rising dangerously high. When asked if he had any concerns that there was a housing bubble, fuelled by the Help to Buy scheme which helps borrowers struggling to raise a deposit, Mr Dale answered: "A healthy housing market is good for economy. But watching carefully for overheating." Twitter's unfiltered nature inevitably draws offbeat comments. Of less importance to UK economy watchers was "do you ever polish the gold 1Kg brick in the museum?" "No need," was the reply, "It stays shiny without out being polished." But questions to Mr Dale answered in the hour-long session were markedly more serious and respectful than the session held by British Gas on Thursday, which was widely hailed as a lesson in how not to engage through social media. </body>

      <title>British Gas Twitter move draws ire</title>

      <body>It surely seemed like a good way to present a human face to customers. On the day it announced prices would rise by 9.2%, British Gas decided to take to the micro-blogging site Twitter to conduct a QandA with its public. But the hashtag #AskBG instead ended up crowd-sourcing a riot of opinion that included black humour and rage. This one was straight to the point: "Social media car crash: British Gas hike energy bills by £123 and then ask Twitter what it thinks." Others were even more blunt: "I've been a loyal customer for a few years. How will you feel when pensioners die from choosing to eat instead of heat???" The session started civilly enough with a simple announcement that British Gas's customer services director would be available for questions. Among the few conventional questions was this: Claire asked: "@BritishGas I can barely make current payments to you. My income is v.low. Can you assist me, or shld I switch?" This was one of the minority of posts British Gas could give a simple answer to: "Hi Claire, if you are worried about rising energy costs please call us 0800 980 1917 or visit http://britishgas.co.uk/warmhomes." Such questions though were swamped by those expressing worry about their bills, or venting their anger at the cost of energy, with typical comments on the plight of pensioners and alternative fuels, such as £10 notes. British Gas sent out a statement after the session had closed: "Our announcement today is difficult news for customers. We didn't make this decision lightly. We know people are worried about rising energy prices and they want to talk about this - including on Twitter - and it's important we're there for them to talk to" It said the QandA was the "right thing to do". </body>

      <body>One of the UK's smallest energy suppliers - Co-operative Energy - has joined two of the big firms in announcing price rises. The firm, which started in 2011 and has 150,000 customers, will increase gas and electricity prices by 4.5%. Existing customers will see their bills go up from 8 January, but the price rise will take effect for new customers from Monday. SSE and British Gas have outlined price rises in recent days. SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills from 15 November and British Gas said prices for its customers would go up by 9.2% on 23 November. These two are part of the group of major UK domestic energy suppliers, known as the "big six". Ministers have said it has been difficult for smaller firms to compete with these major firms. Co-operative Energy, which operates in England, Scotland and Wales and is part of The Midcounties Co-operative, said it had absorbed half of the increased costs it was facing. "Due to increasing energy market costs beyond our control, namely the costs associated with buying energy and getting it into customers' homes, we find ourselves in the position of having to now pass these costs on to our customers," said Ramsay Dunning, general manager of Co-operative Energy. </body>

      <title>Bid for fuel discount in rural towns</title>
      <description>A fuel discount that applies to the Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly could be extended to remote and rural parts of the UK mainland.</description>

      <body>A fuel discount scheme in the Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly could be extended to 10 rural communities in mainland Scotland and England. The UK has applied to the European Commission (EC) for a 5p a litre reduction in fuel duty in those places. They are Acharacle, Achnasheen, Appin, Carrbridge, Dalwhinnie, Gairloch and Strathpeffer. Kirkby-in-Furness in Cumbria, Hawes in North Yorkshire and Lynton in Devon are also included. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said that, as a Highlander, he knew "all too well that fuel prices tend to be highest in areas where a car is needed the most". "We've already delivered a tax cut for remote islands and now want to extend that to mainland rural areas that suffer from similarly high prices to the islands," he added. "We have put together the strongest possible evidence base to try and maximise the places that get it." A decision from the EC is expected next year. "As I've said before, it won't be easy to get this agreed with the commission, but I will do everything I can to make this happen," Mr Alexander said. The 10 locations selected for the application have higher pump prices than in areas that already receive discount, are more than 100 miles by road from the nearest refinery and have a population density lower than 135 people per square km. Pete Williams, RAC head of external affairs, said the application was "good news" because many people in rural communities were "unfairly penalised by high fuel prices as they rely on their cars for work and day-to-day life". "It's also understandable that fuel retailers in these remote areas are selling petrol and diesel at higher prices due to increased distribution costs from being so far from refineries," he added. "Let's hope the European Commission will see the sense in easing the pain for these rural towns when they come to make their decision next year." Labour Treasury spokeswoman Catherine McKinnell said she hoped the announcement would bring relief for drivers in the selected areas. But she added: "Eight out of 10 of these areas have Liberal Democrat MPs - including two in Danny Alexander's own constituency. The public will want to be reassured this is no more than a coincidence because nobody will thank a Lib Dem Treasury minister who refuses to tackle the cost-of-living crisis everywhere but his own back yard." Mr Alexander told BBC Breakfast it was "total nonsense" to suggest the plans were designed to favour seats held by his party. The idea had been put forward by his party in its election manifesto, he said, but the locations had been chosen "according to a strict selection criteria". He said it "would be nice to have a longer list" but the 10 communities chosen had a "reasonable chance of being agreed". Introduced in March 2012, the discount currently applies to the Hebrides, Northern Isles, islands in the Clyde and the Isles of Scilly as well as other island communities in Europe. Retailers register with HM Revenue and Customs to claim 5p a litre relief on fuel for sale to the public. </body>

      <body>Retail sales grew by 0.6% in September compared with the previous month, following an unexpected fall in August. The Office for National Statistics also said sales volumes had risen by 2.2% compared with September 2012, despite a fall of sales in supermarkets. The retail sales figures are based on a monthly survey of 5,000 UK retailers. The performance of the retail industry is seen as an indicator of the wider economy and the strength of consumer spending. Furniture sales provided the biggest driver for the monthly rise in sales, owing to a pick-up in the housing market. Sales volumes in household goods stores grew by 3%. Retail sales have see-sawed in recent months. In July, the fine summer weather pushed sales up higher than expected, with barbecue food selling well. Then, a month later, consumers reined in spending, particularly on food, leading to a drop in sales volumes. In September, analysts had expected a rebound, but not to the degree seen in the latest official figures. In addition to household goods, sales at clothing, footwear and textile retailers increased by 1.2% compared with August. Ian Geddes, UK head of retail at Deloitte, said although confidence was rising, growth in wages remained "stubbornly low", so many consumers were "yet to benefit" from having more money. He said pressure was on for retailers to get their product and brand "exactly right". "Those who deliver highly desirable and creative products with distinctive and well-understood branding continue to reap the rewards," Mr Geddes added. David Tinsley, UK economist at BNP Paribas, said he expected recovery in the housing market to "start to show up shortly". But he said wages would have to rise before a more sustainable recovery could happen. "We would not be surprised to see some softer patches in retail spending ahead," he added. </body>

      <body>Canada and the European Union have struck a free trade agreement aimed at boosting growth and employment. The deal will lower tariffs, streamline regulation, and cut red tape. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso agreed the deal at a meeting in Brussels on Friday. Mr Barroso said they had reached a "breakthrough in negotiations" to achieve "a great agreement for both the European Union and Canada". The deal still requires approval by parliaments and EU member states. Once approved, the agreement aims to make it easier for companies in Canada and the 28-member EU bloc to invest in and sell to each other. The European Union is Canada's second-largest trading partner behind the US. Mr Harper said the agreement was "the biggest (trade) deal our country has ever made". It will give Canada access to a market of some 500 million people in the EU, making it bigger even than the country's North American Free Trade Agreement signed with the US and Mexico. The European Commission expects the deal to increase bilateral trade in goods and services by a fifth to 25.7bn euros ($35bn; £21.7bn) a year. The commission is negotiating trade pacts with more than 80 countries on behalf of the bloc's members following the collapse of the Doha global trade talks. </body>

      <body>Hundreds of thousands of US government employees are back at work after President Barack Obama signed a law ending a 16-day government shutdown and extending the US debt limit. The cross-party deal came hours before the US government risked running out of money to pay its bills. "There are no winners," Mr Obama said, adding the US would "bounce back". The deal followed 16 days of partial government shutdown, which began when Congress failed to agree on a budget. Congress voted through the deal less hours before a deadline to raise the $16.7tn (£10.5tn) debt limit. The measure approved in Washington funds the government to 15 January, and extends the US Treasury's borrowing authority until 7 February. The deal does not resolve the budgetary issues that fiercely divide Republicans and Democrats. Instead, it establishes a cross-party committee of legislators tasked with crafting a long-term budget deal and reporting back to Congress by mid-December. A faction of Republicans in the hardline Tea Party movement had pushed for the confrontation as a way to gut Mr Obama's healthcare reform. However, Mr Obama and the Democrats refused to negotiate, and the law commonly known as Obamacare escaped relatively unscathed. On Thursday, Mr Obama thanked congressional leaders for their help ending the government shutdown and raising the debt limit, but said both had "inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy". "Nothing has done more to undermine our economy the last three years than the kind of tactics that create these kinds of manufactured crises," he said. Mr Obama said politicians had to stop listening to "talking heads" and activists "who profit from conflict" and instead focus on growing the economy and creating a responsible budget. "The American people are completely fed up with Washington," he said. "How business is done in this town has to change." Mr Obama called the political crises "a spectacle" which had hurt America's credibility in the world. And to the conservative Republicans who pushed the showdown as a way to extract policy concessions, he said: "Go out there and win an election." Politicians, bankers and economists had warned of global economic calamity unless an agreement to raise the US government's borrowing limit were reached. IMF head Christine Lagarde's positive response to the news was tempered by a call for further action. "It will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner," she said in a statement. Economists have estimated the shutdown cost the US economy billions of dollars. The shutdown affected Americans and visitors to the US in countless ways: most national parks were closed, medical research ground to a halt, and ordinary paperwork went unfinished, delaying visa applications, business permits and safety inspections. Hundreds of thousands of employees were put on leave without pay during the shutdown, with many forced to delay purchases or even payment of routine bills. A few days into the shutdown Congress passed a law ensuring they would receive back pay. Before dawn on Thursday, the US Office of Personnel Management, which manages the federal workforce, announced in a terse statement on its website that government workers should return to work as regularly scheduled. A senior manager at the Department of the Interior, which oversees the national parks system and other public land, reminded employees to disable "out of office" email messages, change voicemail prompts, and "check on any refrigerators and throw out any perished food". "We appreciate your sacrifices through these difficult times and we understand that the lapse in government activities has imposed hardships on you, your families, and the people we serve," Rhea Suh, assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, wrote. Federal workers returning to the downtown Washington DC office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were greeted by Vice-President Joe Biden and a welcome note from their boss, agency head Gina McCarthy. A security officer at the building said the shutdown had been "depressing" and had made her realise how much she enjoyed her job. "I enjoy checking in 500 people every day," said Ettereteen Welch. Spurred on by hardline conservatives, congressional Republicans forced the stand-off by linking budget measures to healthcare reform. Despite reluctant support from the House Republican leadership for the bill approved on Wednesday, most of the party's lawmakers in the House voted against it. Republican Congressman Mo Brooks told the Associated Press news agency the law that ended the shutdown merely delayed the fight. "We need to get to the underlying cause of the problem, which is our out-of-control spending and deficits," he said, "and fix it before it's too late and we go down the toilet to bankruptcy. Because that's where America is headed." </body>

      <title>Warning of future UK power shortages</title>
      <description>The UK power system is likely to be stretched "close to its limits" in the coming years, a new report warns.</description>

      <body>There is a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years, according to a report commissioned for the prime minister. The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits". Supply is particularly expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15. Last week the National Grid warned of a higher risk of blackouts this winter. The new study was commissioned by the prime minister's Council for Science and Technology to find out how stretched power supplies are likely to be during this decade. "Although the electricity supply is expected to be sufficient to cover predicted levels of demand, it is likely to stretch the system close to its limits, notably during the winter of 2014-15," the report said. Dr John Roberts, one of its authors, added: "We've looked back at real events that happened in the past which caused shocks to our system - like very cold winters, like major power stations shutting down. "If those things happen again in the future and we don't take measures to correct what's going on, then there's a serious risk that we will have power shortages." To avoid what its authors called "a blackout scenario by 2020", the report called on ministers to: Reacting to the report, Business Minister Michael Fallon said: "The lights are not going to go out. There will be a tightness in supply if nothing is done but stuff is being done. "We've opened six new gas plants already. Another is being built. You're going to hear very soon about our investment in new nuclear power stations." Two years ago the UK had a buffer between energy supply and demand of 16%, but this winter that will fall to 5% and it could hit 2% by 2015, according to the National Grid and the energy regulator, Ofgem. </body>

      <title>Australia's surf firms making waves</title>
      <description>Surfing is a national pastime in Australia, which continues to sustain a significant community of small firms, as the BBC's Phil Mercer reports.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24517642</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70463000/jpg/_70463014_aus1afp.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>A century ago, Duke Kahanamoku, a majestic Hawaiian board rider, helped to ignite modern Australia's passion for surfing. His showboating exhibition on the waves at Freshwater Beach in Sydney is widely seen as the catalyst for a national obsession. Picked from a curious crowd, a teenage girl was given what was almost certainly Australia's first official surfing lesson by the man known simply as the Duke. Today, the same swells that barrel in from the Pacific Ocean continue to thrill and they now sustain a range of small businesses that feed the popular surf tourism industry. At nearby Manly Beach, a class of beginners is about to take to the water for the very first time. It's a hot day in spring, and conditions are perfect for novices - the breeze is light, the waves gentle and the tuition patient. "It's a tough sport. Surfing is very similar to golf - you never master it, there are always things you can learn," says Nick James, from Manly Surf School, which was founded in 1995 and has 20 full-time staff. It pays about 50,000 Australian dollars ($47,000; £29,600) per year to the local council for exclusive rights to operate on one of Sydney's most celebrated stretches of sand. A standard two-hour group lesson for an adult costs A$70, while children pay A$55. Mr James says that business is generally vibrant, but admits that, like the weather, things can be unpredictable. "It's challenging. We've got to pay licences to run our surf schools on the beaches. "It's a good business, but there are times when we're closed for a week due to the surf conditions." There are 35 licensed surf schools in New South Wales, the most populous state in Australia. The sport's regional governing body has estimated that surfing pumps more than A$500m into the state's economy. "The sport is becoming increasingly more attractive," says Mark Windon, chief executive of Surfing New South Wales. "It is becoming more mainstream. It is just going to get more popular. In the next 10 years, you'll probably see triple the growth that you've seen in the last 10." At Manly, the latest converts tentatively paddle out for their initial encounter with the breakers. They have limited success - boards suddenly become airborne, dumping their breathless passengers into the drink. But back they come for more, and herein lies the secret to surfing's success. For many, its magnetic appeal is irresistible, and what's hearty for the soul is also good for the bottom line, according to Stacey Randell, executive officer of the Manly Chamber of Commerce. "Our whole region is based on the water, and surfing is huge economically speaking, and the amount of visitors it brings in every year is vital to the businesses in this community. Everybody benefits from this culture," she says. Yet while wave riding in Australia has never been more popular, independent surfing shops are struggling to stay afloat in a highly competitive market. "It is not particularly an easy living for most surf shop owners. You'll find most of them are pressed pretty hard by the big corporates to sell specific merchandise and conform to corporate dictates," says Doug Booth, the Australian-born dean of the School of Physical Education, Sport and Exercise Sciences at the University of Otago in New Zealand. A couple of streets back from Manly's sun-drenched waterfront, Tim Hanrahan, the owner of the Aloha surf shop, unloads another consignment of high-end boards. I ask if his head is financially above water? "Just," he says, laughing. "I make OK money." "It's difficult. It's not an easy job. The profit margins particularly on the boards are quite low. I've seen a lot of competitors come and go. "There is a lot of tourism in Manly, but realistically you've got to have the locals behind you, too. That's what keeps you going through the quieter months." Surfing Australia estimates there are more than 2.5 million recreational board riders around the country. It is far beyond simply a sport, but a lifestyle and cultural phenomenon that tourists are keen to experience. "I've always wanted to surf," says Ashton Williams, an investment software worker from Mississippi in the United States, as he wades out of the ocean at the end of his lesson at Manly. "It's much tougher than I thought, but when you're finally gliding over the water it is one of the most peaceful things. It's pretty amazing." </body>

      <title>Nepalese airline taking off</title>
      <description>The BBC's Surendra Phuyal talks to Birendra Bahadur Basnet about growing a private airline in Nepal.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24513257</url>
      <date>1381878293</date>

      <body>What makes an entrepreneur? The BBC's Surendra Phuyal hears from Birendra Bahadur Basnet, a private-airline owner in Nepal, about the risks he took starting his business, and how he believes success can be achieved. He does not come from a family of business people. His father is a retired judge, his ancestors were farmers in eastern Nepal. But Birendra Bahadur Basnet, 49, is amongst Nepal's most successful entrepreneurs. He has carved a niche in the country's not-so-impressive aviation sector in just a few years. When he registered his airline, Buddha Air, and started operations in 1996, the business graduate from a Kathmandu university had only one aircraft that was purchased with a loan: a US-made Beechcraft 1900D. Nearly two decades later, he is is the proud owner of nine aircraft - three Beechcraft 1900, three ATR 42-320 and three ATR 72-500 aircraft. Basnet's Buddha Air fleet is the largest in Nepal's domestic sector. "When we obtained the loan of around NPR 70m (£442,000; $708,000) in 1996 to set up our business and purchase an aircraft, our friends and relatives and other people said we had gone mad," Basnet, says, smiling. "But we started doing good in aviation sector and we paid our loan after six years," he says, adding his airline business has grown almost ten-fold since then. When he started, he recalls Nepal's state-owned airline Royal Nepal Airlines was not particularly successful and the newly liberalised domestic aviation market was looking for stable players from the private sector. "That's precisely where we saw the gap and we jumped in," he says. "The market was competitive, but safety, reliability and comfort being our mantra, we succeeded in winning the trust of our customers and we have been adding aircraft, one after another to our fleet." Basnet's road to success has not been easy though; the biggest blow came in September 2011 when one of his Beechcraft crashed on a hill near Kathmandu while returning from an aborted Mount Everest sightseeing flight, killing 19 people. "We thought we were invincible, but that crash proved we were not," he said, tears welling up in his eyes. "We lost three of our great colleagues, several other people and the aircraft. "That was a very sad experience that we had, but that also helped us grow." After the crash, he says, the airline did a review of its flight safety mechanisms and other related procedures to ensure that Buddha Air's safety standards remain impeccable. "We thought people would choose other airlines after the crash, we were concerned," he says. "But that didn't affect our business. People - both Nepalis and foreigners - continued to love us." Every morning, Buddha Air attracts dozens of foreign tourists to Kathmandu airport for its early morning sightseeing flights to the Mount Everest region - it hosted former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan when he visited Nepal in 2001. Boasting Nepal's first private airline to have its own hangar within Kathmandu Airport premises, Buddha Air flies to major towns inside Nepal and connects the Indian city of Varanashi with Kathmandu. "We are the first private airline to fly outside Nepal," says Basnet, adding that he plans to take Buddha Air to other major cities in the Asia Pacific region in future to better facilitate connectivity for passengers flying into and out of Nepal. Buddha Air currently employs more than 700 people, offering them salaries between 150 dollars and thousands of dollars per month. "They are a mostly happy bunch of people," he says. "We are like a happy family, but still we need to make sure that everyone is looked after and content." His recipe for success remains this: "Don't multi-task, focus on your goal. Success is floating around, all you have to do is go and grab it. But again, you have to focus on what you want to do and what you want to achieve." </body>

      <title>Cooking up a successful food business</title>
      <description>UK ready meals boss Charlie Bigham talks about how he was inspired to set up his company, and how he grew it successfully.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24434154</url>
      <date>1381707185</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70398000/jpg/_70398329_vw.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Inspiration can often come from strange places. For UK ready meals boss Charlie Bigham it was being unable to sleep at the border between Iran and Pakistan. Mr Bigham was 28 years old at the time, and he and his then girlfriend were travelling from the UK to India by camper van. "It was very, very hot, and we were in a really tough place," he says. "I couldn't sleep, so I just laid there restlessly thinking about what I was going to do for a living when we got back home. "I decided there and then that I was going to set up a food business, and it was going to look a bit like this." Mr Bigham had previously worked as a management consultant in London, before he and his girlfriend quit their jobs to go travelling for nine months. His ambition was to set up his own company when they returned to the UK, and now he had his idea - he was going to establish a business that made upmarket ready meals. Mr Bigham was not going to let the fact that he had never worked in the food industry before put him off, and instead he decided he would quickly set about gaining the knowledge and skills he needed. And so upon his return to the UK he got a job at a delicatessen in London's fashionable Notting Hill area. "I've always been really interested in food, but I had no food industry experience, so I knew I had to get some cheese under my fingernails, so to speak," he says. He ended up spending almost four months at the deli, and at the same time did lots of research, and working on recipes. "It became clear that the idea of making meals which are then sold via shops was a very good idea for a business because it was a massive market, yet one which was very straightforward to start up in," says Mr Bigham. "I knew we could start under the radar before any bigger rivals could crush us, and then build quite quickly." In November 1996, 11 months after his return from travelling, and now married to his girlfriend, Mr Bigham launched the business with £25,000 of savings, calling it simply "Charlie Bigham's". To begin with, it was just him and one chef based at a small facility in London's Park Royal business estate. Mr Bigham says: "We had just three product lines to start with - zesty Caribbean lamb, Cajun chicken with salsa, and salmon with a dill and cream sauce. I think we made just 20 meals in total in that first week." To get sales moving, Mr Bigham, now 47, says he simply started "knocking on people's doors". "I went round all the posh delis in London, and the big department stores with food halls. Everyone was approachable, and said, 'Yeah we'll give you a go'. "I just had to be mildly persuasive, and I'm not a salesman. "What greatly helped us, is that you have to remember that at the time, most ready - or convenience - meals, as I prefer to call them, were pretty dreadful. "We were one of the first to make quality ones without anything artificial. This set us apart and made shops interested in stocking us." But while selling to posh stores in London was pleasing, Mr Bigham realised that in order to grow the business he needed to win a contract with one of the UK's supermarket groups. And so he cold-called Waitrose. "I just picked up the phone and rang the Waitrose switchboard. I managed to persuade a lovely woman on the phone to put me through to a buyer. I got a meeting, and the buyer said she would give us a go." Charlie Bigham's meals have been stocked by Waitrose ever since, initially at 40 stores for a successful trial period, and then nationwide. Online supermarket Ocado, and Booths, the north of England supermarket chain, have since followed suit. The company now employs 200 people across two sites at the Park Royal business park, and has an annual turnover of £20m, which is now growing at 19% per annum. Mr Bigham says his former job as a management consultant helped him manage the company's growth over the past 17 years. But he is the first to admit that luck and good timing played a major role in his success. "The only way you can ever set up a successful business is to be lucky," he says. "It is the thing you need more than anything else. Anyone who says otherwise is just lying." Mr Bigham says that most important piece of luck was all to do with timing. "I set up a food business just as interest in food was blossoming in this country. Suddenly there was a wealth of TV chefs, and the national newspapers all added food sections at weekends. "And the supermarkets were all being brave and looking outwards towards new suppliers. There was no planning or forethought about all this on my part, it was pure luck." Mr Bigham today gives himself the job title "chairman and creative director". This followed his decision back in 2010 to bring in someone else to handle the chief executive role. "It has enabled me to focus on the bits of the business I'm really interested in - product development, and the big strategic picture - working out plans for the next three to five years," he says. "The bit in the middle [the day-to-day financial decisions etc] I'm easily bored by, and is best done by someone else." Looking ahead, Mr Bigham says the company has no plans to start exporting, because the freshness, and therefore limited shelf life of his products, makes it too expensive. Nor does he ever intend to move production away from London to somewhere cheaper, because he says he is loyal to his hard-working staff. "I'm proud of what we have done to date, but I'm in no way complacent. Owning your own business is a hugely privileged position to be in, because I work with people I have chosen - not many people can say that." </body>

      <body>Italian football club Inter Milan has become the latest European club to be taken over by foreign investors. A trio of Indonesian businessmen led by media tycoon Erick Thohir have bought a 70% stake in the club. The club did not disclose the value of deal, but various reports estimated it to be between 250m - 300m euros ($340m; £210m - $405m; £250m). The two sides had been negotiating for some time amid efforts by the club to bring in fresh capital. Massimo Moratti, the president of the club, said the club's "history is going to be enriched by a new season thanks to our new international partners who, I am sure, will contribute to a continued string of successes". "The new partners' enthusiasm and pragmatism are certainly a guarantee for the future," he added in a statement. Mr Thohir is also a co-owner of DC United, a Major League Soccer club in the US and has also served as vice president of the Indonesian Olympic Committee. The other two partners in the deal are Rosan Roeslani and Handy Soetedjo. Mr Roeslani also owns a stake in DC United, while Mr Soetedjo was involved in the purchase of basketball team Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 2011. </body>

      <title>Evans to give up Pirates ownership</title>
      <description>Cornish Pirates owner Dicky Evans is to stand down at the end of the season, but will continue to help fund the team.</description>

      <body>Cornish Pirates owner Dicky Evans has announced plans to step aside at the end of the season, but insists he will continue to help finance the team. The 67-year-old plans to sell 150 shares in the club and has committed to providing £400,000 in funding on a two-year rolling basis. The businessman has been involved at the Pirates since 1994. "We need to alter the ownership of the club in readiness for the next push as I'm not getting younger," said Evans. In a lengthy statement on the Cornish Pirates website,   Evans laid out his vision for the future of the club over the next few years and explained his decision to change the ownership model. "I have to think of my family for a change, four people who have been incredibly supportive of me," he added. "I intend to step aside, not down, at the end of the season as the owner of the company and hand over ownership to the many superb friends and supporters who follow the team. "Consequently, over the next eight months to the end of this current financial year we need to develop a plan to enable friends and supporters of the Cornish Pirates worldwide to take ownership through a basic share issue format. "They will be taking over a company clear of all loans and debt - paying a nominal £1 for the whole shareholding." The Pirates have risen up the leagues to the Championship during Evans' time at the club, but have so far found the ultimate prize of a place in the Premiership frustratingly out of reach. Evans said the need to move to a stadium in a more central location in Cornwall - ideally in Truro - was a key hurdle for the club to clear in order to progress and increase their fanbase. The pursuit of a larger stadium in Truro has been a long-running issue for the Pirates, who are currently based at Mennaye Field in Penzance in the far south-west of the county. The club have led a nomadic existence in recent seasons having played at Kenwyn near Truro and at Camborne during the last decade. "This is the next major step in securing our future," added Evans. "The stadium will come eventually and it's essential that the Cornish Pirates are in a position to move to the centre of Cornwall and consolidate on the business and spectator support available there, witnessed by the year we spent at Kenwyn - our most successful year at this level financially. "The rugby will be of the highest calibre possible within the budget constraints that are always with us and the party atmosphere will continue both home and away. "Cornish people deserve a top-class sporting team and venue - we have the ability to produce the former and as each obstacle to a stadium is surmounted there is no doubt that will come. "The Pirates are a vital part of this dream - let's not let it go down the tubes." Evans also plans to offer some "iconic players" and coaches Ian Davies and Harvey Biljon long-term contracts until the end of the 2015-16 season as part of a commitment to working closely with the wider Cornish rugby community. "Hopefully we can work with the senior Cornish clubs such as Redruth and Launceston to provide our qualified coaches on an almost full-time basis," he said. "At the same time we can work with these clubs to lend them Pirates squad players. "And there is no reason why other players with coaching qualifications cannot work with other Cornish clubs at no salary cost to that club. "We have a deep squad this year and will continue to target all competitions. Once we have decided and agreed which players we think will make the grade we will commence negotiations and we will be cutting our cloth to suit. "Our budget funds next season should be sufficient to enable us retain a very competitive side." </body>

      <title>Rangers forced to postpone their AGM</title>
      <description>Rangers' annual meeting is delayed after shareholders seeking changes to the club's board won a court decision.</description>

      <body>Rangers have been forced to postpone their 24 October annual meeting after shareholders seeking changes at board level won a court decision. Lord Tyre granted an interim interdict at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, preventing the AGM from going ahead. Rangers had said there was not enough time for four directors nominated by shareholders to be put up for election. But the group said Rangers had broken the law by failing to ensure the motion was on the agenda. It is the latest development in a battle for control of the Scottish League One leaders. The group wants Malcolm Murray, who was club chairman until April, Paul Murray, who was a director until last year, director of Loch Lomond Golf Club Scott Murdoch and Alex Wilson, a former HR director with BT, to be appointed to the board. Paul Murray told BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme : "Today was all about shareholder democracy. We wanted to put in front of the shareholders, the fans and the other stakeholders of the club the ability to have a democratic vote at the AGM. "We submitted four nominations on 27 September. Those have been shown today to have been perfectly valid legal notices. "The club's board chose to ignore those notices and issue an AGM notice that is flawed and set a date of 24 October that is now having to be rearranged." "I think both [chief executive] Craig Mather and [finance director] Brian Stockbridge have to seriously consider their positions tonight because I think they are untenable. "The board chose to tie us up in all sorts of legal mechanisms that were reported today in court and we've been vindicated." Richard Keen QC, representing the shareholder group, accused the club of engaging in "guerrilla warfare" in its battle to prevent a group of shareholders from joining the Ibrox board. He told Lord Tyre the directors of the club had "committed an offence" by not informing other shareholders of the requisition. "An offence has been committed by every member of this board," Keen said. "The board have placed themselves in a very difficult situation by failing to discharge their statutory obligations. They have committed an offence. "If I am right, the consequences of that must be visited upon them." Mather and his fellow board members have been sued by the requisitioners. The current Rangers board has so far blocked the attempts at change, claiming the application was not properly authenticated and that it did not arrive on time. Keen claimed the signatures requested by the board had been offered "timeously" before adding: "These requests have been sent by the relevant companies and, on the face of it, there is no reason to doubt their validity." However, Heriot Currie QC, representing the board of Rangers International Football Club, told Lord Tyre: "The petitioners have known since 12 September that they had to organise themselves for a shareholder meeting by no later than 30 October." The Murrays, along with shareholders Ian Cormack, John Graham and Colin Howell, made requests in writing to Rangers International Football Club plc to give notice to members of the resolutions to appoint new directors at the AGM on 27 September. They maintained they had enough support from institutional shareholders to take them over the key threshold of 5% of the total voting rights to allow such a move. Currie said there was no obligation on the part of the company to circulate the resolutions and claimed documents and related information were supplied that at the very least raised "very significant doubt" over three of the backers of the move making valid requisitions. Rangers must re-arrange their AGM to be held before the end of December and must give shareholders at least 21 days' notice. They say they will fix a new date "as soon as possible" with the requisitioners' business included, but they have defended their decision to initially oppose the notices. Following the Court of Session decision, Rangers issued a statement on their website  : "The board of directors of the company received clear and firm advice from its solicitors and senior and junior counsel that on the face of documents provided by the petitioners, the notices had not been signed in a manner that was authorised and as a result the directors were obliged to seek further clarification from those shareholders. "Every effort was made to engage with the petitioners on these issues. However, the petitioners chose to resolve the matter in court. In Lord Tyre's opinion, these irregularities did not invalidate the notices." </body>

A dispute about pay and pensions has caused the closure and owners Ineos say they are being held to ransom by the union. The union says the company is behaving badly. Tom Crotty, a director of Ineos, told the Today programme: "The reason we had the plant closed is that Unite served notice that they were going to strike, which they then called off.

      <body>When Sir Stuart Rose says something on retail, it's worth listening. With a 40-year track record in the industry, the former chief executive and chairman of Marks and Spencer is famed for turning around struggling retailers. Now an independent, non-executive director at South Africa's Woolworths Holdings, a chain of shops selling fashion, food, beauty and home ware, he says retail has changed. "Where the customer used to be king before, the customer is now the master of the universe: and they want what they want, how they want it, when they want it." For Woolworths, this shift has been felt most keenly in clothing - an area that along with beauty and home ware makes up 38% of its business in South Africa. In response, over the past two to three years it has made a conscious effort to make its clothing more fashionable, which crucially has involved getting it from the design stage to the shop floor much more quickly. "Previously it was 11-months-plus for all of our clothing products to the point now where we can turn [an item] around in 90 days," says Ian Moir, chief executive of Woolworths (which has no connection with the former British High Street chain of the same name). The strategy appears to be working. The company's most recent results for the year to the end of June saw clothing sales grow by 13.7%. "If we don't give the customer the trend, the colour, the fashion they're looking for, at the end of the day they're going to go somewhere else," says Mr Moir. Neil Saunders, managing director at retail consultancy Conlumino, says the changes at Woolworths reflect a "sea change" in how supermarket groups sell clothing. "They have become more like clothing retailers. Five years ago they used to merchandise it in the same way as, for example, baked beans. They piled it high and sold it cheap. But now they have become lifestyle rather than commodity-led." Mr Saunders says the 2008 financial crisis and resulting recession is a key reason behind this change in approach, with a trend for people to choose quality items that they expect to last. "Before the recession people bought lots of stuff... they even bought stuff they didn't wear. There was a disposable element because clothing was cheap and people felt affluent. "People are more frugal now. They buy less stuff and follow the ethos of, 'If you buy it right you buy it once.'" Mr Saunders says, however, that low prices can still lure in customers if they are combined with fashion, citing Primark as an example. "It's on trend and that makes people very interested. But if a retailer just chases value then they struggle," he adds. UK supermarket group Sainsbury's founded its clothing range Tu almost a decade ago. James Brown, clothing business director at Sainsbury's, says when Tu began it was focused on core products such as leggings, jogging bottoms and T-shirts, with ranges changed every 12 weeks or longer. But in the past two years it has become more trend-led. "Since our recent rebrand the new Tu range is refreshed every six weeks to keep up with the latest fashions, and offer new products to our customer," says Mr Brown. "Over the last nine years we have learnt more about our broad customer base and have adapted the range to offer more High Street-style garments at supermarket prices to meet customer demand," he adds. The approach seems to be working - at its recent trading update for the 16 weeks to 28 September it said its general merchandise and clothing business grew at more than twice the rate of its food business. Mr Brown says new items are planned up to seven months in advance, but that it can react quickly to last-minute trends by turning around a style in just eight weeks, assuming it can get the necessary fabric and has the production capacity. In contrast, for High Street chain Zara, production capacity is rarely an issue because unusually its owner Inditex has its own factories. These manufacture what it says is a "significant share" of its clothing for its eight brands, which include upmarket Massimo Dutti and teen label Bershka, but primarily the most fashionable garments. For those items the clothes can be produced and in store in a rapid two to three weeks. "Customer expectations are higher than ever so our capability to adapt and react to their demands is one of our key strengths," says an Inditex source. For Ian Moir, this is the key to Woolworths' future. "The importance of fashion is becoming greater and greater and customer awareness is getting better and better. "They're very fashion aware and they want it now. That's the way the world is going, it's the way it's changing and it's the way we've got to change as a business."

      <title>Are markets 'efficient' or irrational?</title>
      <description>The joint Nobel winners who fundamentally disagree</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24579616</url>

      <body>Two economists with diametrically opposing interpretations of the way markets behave have been jointly awarded the 2013 Nobel memorial prize for economics. Why? This story begins way back at the start of the 20th Century, in Paris. Louis Bachelier, aspiring physicist, lives a life filled with misfortune. His parents die suddenly, leaving him holding his baby brother. He's not free to enter university until he's too old to be admitted. He takes night classes instead, producing one of Einstein's famous results before Einstein does - and he's all but laughed out of academia. But in 1900, Bachelier publishes work that, long after his death, will be recognised as ground-breaking. His remarkable idea is that the price of government bonds follow a random course - each new movement in the price will be unpredictable. At first sight it's an odd idea. Why would the performance of a financial asset be random? But Bachelier understood that if it was obvious that a share or a bond would be worth more next week, then the price should already have risen in anticipation of that. Predictable moves have already happened, because the market is efficient - and all that is left are unpredictable surprises. In the economics department of the University of Chicago in the 1960s, student Eugene Fama knew Louis Bachelier's theory well, but wasn't satisfied. "It dawned on me that that statement wasn't enough," he says. "There's no economical model behind that." And so Fama went to work, and ended up demonstrating that stock markets are indeed efficient. If you are an investor, one important consequence of an efficient market is that there's no point trying to make a killing. The market will always be one step ahead of you. Better to invest broadly rather than believing in some get-rich-quick scheme. Fama himself has, in fact, found some ways to beat the market - or at least, investment strategies that would have beaten the market in the past. But he concludes nonetheless that for practical investment purposes, people might as well behave as though markets are efficient, and that nothing is therefore underpriced. "Because if they are inefficient it's very difficult to tell how, when and where, and the evidence suggests that supposed experts aren't very good at it," he says. "People spend lots of money trying to hire managers that can pick stocks, although the evidence says quite conclusively that that is probably impossible to do." So the market is always right. Or is it? A decade later, a challenger to the efficient markets hypothesis arrives on the scene - Robert Shiller, now at Yale, then at MIT. He wrote a paper making a statistical case that market volatility is too high for the efficient markets theory to be true. His idea was that markets have a tendency to overreact to news, or to react to non-news. "This got me into a huge controversy then," he recalls. "I was wondering why do people get so emotional about this? I'm just saying something that's common sense and obvious - these markets aren't perfect." And this argument doesn't stay in academic circles. It makes it into the heart of real world economics. In 1996 Robert Shiller is invited to lunch with the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan. "I asked the table, 'When was the last time a Fed chairman had said that he thought that the stock market was overpriced?'" The answer came that it was about 30 years ago. "So I said to Greenspan, 'Maybe you ought to consider making a statement about the overpricing of the market?'" Just a few days later the Federal Reserve Chairman made a speech that has become famous. "How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in Japan over the past decade?" he said. Having prodded Alan Greenspan into action, Shiller went on to write a best-selling book called Irrational Exuberance, and he's famous for saying in the late 1990s that shares were hugely overvalued - and they did crash not long after - and for saying in 2005 that US house prices were overvalued. And they crashed too. Was he just lucky? What were his reasons for pointing to a bubble? Well, stock analysts commonly looked at how company profits, or earnings, compared to their share price. What Shiller and his colleague John Campbell had decided to do was take a longer-term view of this price-earnings ratio. They compared the share price to the average earnings for the past 10 years. This long-term price-earnings ratio showed a sharp peak in 1929, just before the great Wall Street crash. And the peak in the late 1990s was even bigger. So why don't we see these irrational booms at the time? "I think it's because a lot of people benefit by seeing the boom continue," Shiller says. "And there's a sense that no-one should shout 'Fire!' in a crowded theatre - everything's going great, right? Earnings are going up, prices are going up." But Eugene Fama isn't convinced that it's quite so easy to spot trouble in financial markets. "The notion that for example regulators should somehow go in and burst bubbles is to me a joke," he says. "I don't think anybody really recognises bubbles - I mean I don't even like the word - apart from in 20/20 hindsight." In Gene Fama's view, when technology stocks boomed in the late 1990s, and then crashed, that reflected people's views about the prospects of highly successful companies emerging from the melee. Not quite enough of them did, to sustain share prices at that level. But that didn't make the market irrational, it just made it wrong - with hindsight. We shouldn't overlook Lars Peter Hansen. He was the third Nobel prize winner, for developing statistical tools that are now hugely influential in economics - especially in the study of financial markets. But we wouldn't be human if we weren't curious about the apparent contradiction in awarding shares of the Nobel prize to Eugene Fama for showing that the market is efficient, and Robert Shiller for showing that it isn't. Is the committee just hedging its bets? Both will get a mention in the history books as having contributed to the future development of economic thought, in Shiller's view. "It's a little bit like religion," he says. "I mean there are all these different sects and if you look at them in the whole it doesn't seem to make any sense - they contradict each other so fundamentally. But maybe there's some wisdom about living that comes out of all of them. And I think that the economics profession isn't as fragmented as it may seem." But was it not a little irritating to share the Nobel memorial prize with someone who seems to contradict you? "I think there is rule for substantial disagreement and I think all points of view - all interpretations of the evidence - should get a full airing," Fama says. "I mean, all of that makes the world a much more interesting place, and I was thrilled that Bob got it." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>As Abba once sang so wistfully, breaking up is never easy. But when Benny and the band reflected on the passing memories and the tears, they forgot to mention the practical dilemmas faced by separating couples: how to divide the money, and what to do about the children. And in the last six months sorting out those issues has got even harder. Dozens of centres designed to help couples split up amicably are in danger of closure. Indeed some are already in the process of shutting their doors. The closures are an unintended consequence of cuts to the legal aid system, which the government introduced in April. Since then mediators have seen far fewer couples coming through their doors. In May last year 2,800 couples attended sessions, according to the government. By May this year that had more than halved to 1,200. For most people, mediation is a much less stressful process than going to court. It is also cheaper. The mediator will take it for granted that the couple is splitting up, so his or her job is simply to help divide the financial assets, and arrange access to the children. Lawyers are not involved. "It gets sorted a lot quicker. You both still have your say. And there are no arguments," says 23 year-old Sinead Harris from Guildford in Surrey. She spilt from her partner earlier this year, and needed help with arranging access to her two year-old son. "Going through the courts would have meant more stress and more arguments," she says, "which is not good for a child to be around." So why are fewer people using the service? Since April, most couples no longer qualify for legal aid for divorce or separation. When they did receive legal aid, lawyers would often refer them on to mediators. Now that process no longer happens. "Because there's no legal aid, people don't look at mediation," says Eileen Pereira, of National Family Mediation. "Ours has become a hidden service," she adds. Eight mediation services, including some based in Sussex, Wiltshire, Hertfordshire and Lancashire, have already announced their intention to close. Eileen Pereira believes three or four times that number are also under threat. If the closures continue she worries that many more families will be forced to use lawyers instead. "That means they will be spending more," she says. "But also the emotional impact on the family will be much greater because the families will not be supported through this process." The government, which had hoped the legal aid changes might actually encourage more people to use mediation, has been taken by surprise by the fall-off in demand. Lord McNally, the Families Justice Minister, admitted that it was a "hiccup". "We've noticed the dip," he told the BBC. "We're looking at how we can address the issue, and hope to help them promote more mediation more vigorously in the future," he said. But in the meantime much of the £25m set aside as legal aid for mediation has remained unspent. From April 2014, a new law will require those separating in the courts to at least have tried mediation. The government believes that will re-invigorate demand for the services. National Family Mediation, which represents mediation services around the country, cannot be certain how many services will still be in existence by then. In the meantime the government is doing its best to encourage people to go ahead and find a mediator themselves, without being referred by a lawyer. Couples can go via a Ministry of Justice website to locate a mediator based near them, or via National Family Mediation. Those interested are also being reminded that in many cases legal aid is available. Anyone with income below £31,884 might be eligible, depending on some property-owning criteria as well. In addition the government has produced a video, to give people further advice. When they sang, Knowing me, knowing you, Abba also suggested, "There is nothing we can do." However, that is a sentiment that advocates of mediation might well challenge. Even though some break-ups are inevitable, there are ways in which the practicalities, and the costs, of separation can be made more tolerable. </body>

      <title>Energy bills: Where does my money go?</title>
      <description>Where does my money go?</description>

      <body>Ed Miliband has pledged that gas and electricity bills will not go up for 20 months if Labour wins the 2015 election. The promise, made in his speech at the party's annual conference, has stoked up a debate over energy prices and their justification. So where exactly does customers' money go and what might be the effect of a price freeze? How much do we pay? The average annual dual-fuel bill - covering gas and electricity - is £1,315 per household. This figure, published by regulator Ofgem in mid-September, is based on the latest assumption of the amount of energy a typical household uses. Bear in mind, this is an average. The amount you pay depends on your energy consumption and the method of payment. It is one of the largest regular bills that a household has to pay, behind mortgage or rent, and council tax. Prices have risen in recent years, and analysts predict another increase in the coming weeks. Do people in other countries pay more or less? As with many aspects of this sector, the answer is not simple. The Department of Energy and Climate Change has had a crack at a comparison, but data for countries including Belgium, Italy and Sweden is unavailable. These figures show that average domestic electricity prices in the UK, including taxes, last year were the fourth lowest among 15 EU countries, and the fourth highest among the G7 group of nations. For gas, domestic prices in the UK in 2012 were the second lowest among the 15 EU counties that were compared, and the third lowest in the G7. Households in the US benefited from the lowest prices for both gas and electricity. How much of my bill ends up as the energy firms' profits? The argument over whether the major energy suppliers' profits are "excessive" is central to this debate. The regulator has been collecting data on these firms' profit margins for the past three years. The latest statistics, from mid-September, show that the average profit margin made on the £1,315 bill is £65. This was £30 higher than September 2011 and September 2012. However, it is worth bearing in mind that this is a snapshot and the figure has been volatile. In some months, the profit margin has risen above £100, whereas in others the margin has been negative. Ofgem says that seasonal factors are key to this volatility. Where does the rest of the money go? By far the biggest chunk of your bill goes on the cost of buying gas and electricity on the wholesale market, or directly from an electricity generator or gas supplier. This, in addition to the costs of running a retail business with billing and sales, accounts for 67% of a gas bill and 58% of an electricity bill, according to Ofgem. But this is where the figures get really complicated. Wholesale gas and electricity is not a single product but a whole series of contracts. Each company's team of traders will be buying energy at different prices, depending on whether this is delivered tomorrow, next month, or even in five years' time. They spread out the purchases of energy to mitigate the risk of volatility when, for example, there is unrest in an oil-producing region. OK, and what else does my bill cover? About 16% of it goes on distribution charges - the cost of the gas pipes and electricity wires that get the energy into your home. The cost of high pressure gas and high voltage transmission networks account for 2% of a gas bill and 4% of an electricity bill. VAT accounts for 5% of each. A bit goes on costs of metering and storing gas. Then, 6% of a gas bill and 11% of an electricity bill go to government schemes aimed at saving energy, reducing emissions and tackling climate change. It is these "green" fees that the energy suppliers say have pushed up the cost of a typical bill in recent years. What might be the effect of a price freeze? Some of the energy companies, and those who represent them, argue that the lights could go out if prices cannot be changed for nearly two years. In reality, we will not be plunged into darkness. What they mean is that the decommissioning of coal - and ultimately nuclear - power plants, is going to create a shortfall in energy production in the UK. If they are going to build new power production plants, such as wind farms or power stations, huge amounts of investment are needed. An inability to set prices would affect this long-term strategy. In response, Ed Miliband says that firms have been "overcharging" customers for many years. Consumer groups say a price freeze would be popular, but there would be hurdles in making such a policy work. Can the regulator step in if prices are pushed up ahead of the general election? No, Ofgem has no control of the prices that companies charge their customers. Instead, a supplier might find that it is undercut by other firms if it puts up prices significantly, leading customers to switch. If all firms do the same, this competition argument is weakened. However, Ed Miliband says he would take action if prices went up sharply before the election, if Labour formed the next government. What else might it mean for competition? It could affect new, smaller businesses trying to get into the market. They would be unable to change prices, leading to more volatility in terms of profits. Open4Energy, one of only a handful of new suppliers licensed by Ofgem, has already said that it would pull out of the UK if a price freeze looked like becoming policy. How can I save money on my bill now? There are various ways to save money on your energy bill, if you are a homeowner or a tenant. They include looking for better deals and switching suppliers if needs be, especially if you have been on the same tariff for a long time. Paying by direct debit, and receiving bills online can also reduce costs for those currently paying by cheque every quarter. </body>

      <title>Why tech women need a makeover</title>
      <description>How to attract girls to the tech industry</description>

      <body>Anne-Marie Imafidon is in a rush to get on with life. Perhaps that is why she passed a GCSE in computer science aged 10, became the youngest graduate to attain a masters degree, aged 19, and is already planning the future of her unborn children. And if daughters come along she is clear that she doesn't want them to "feel like the odd ones out," if they decide, like her, to pursue a career in technology. As a self-confessed stubborn woman, she hopes she can succeed where others have failed - in reducing the huge gap between girls and boys studying so-called Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths. To do this, she has set up Stemettes, which she runs when she isn't in her day job at a global investment bank. She was one of just three girls in a class of 70 studying maths and computer science at university. "At the time I wasn't that bothered, I just thought it was part and parcel of studying computer science," she says. "But then last year I spoke at a conference and I heard that the numbers of women in technology was in decline and I thought, 'That isn't right.' "Technology is at the forefront of the economy and women have a vital role to play. When my daughters are born I don't want them to feel like the odd ones out." The UK has a massive skills gap. Only 17% of the UK's tech jobs are held by women. In Stem subjects generally women make up just 13% of the workforce. In engineering women fare even worse, taking up just 8% of the jobs. So where does it all go wrong? At secondary school, girls are as likely as boys to study Stem subjects, at least up to GCSE, but for A-levels and beyond, female representation drops off dramatically. And among girls who carry on and study science at university, two out of three don't go on to Stem-related careers. The reasons for the drop-off in interest are multiple, thinks Ms Imafidon. "Some schools, often girl-only schools, simply don't offer ICT [information and communications technology] at A-level and the girls wanting to do it have to go to a nearby boys school to learn it," she says. "In other schools, computer science often clashes with things like drama or music, meaning the girls can't do both. If every other girl is doing drama, you'd want to be in a class with all your friends rather than take the difficult route and do computer science." Girls are very aware that their choice of A-level subjects impacts what they study at university and which one they go to. It means that girls tend to choose "safe" subjects that they know they will get a good grade in, according to Ms Imafidon. "Choosing computer science is an unnecessarily tough choice and one you aren't going to make unless you are one of the stubborn girls like I was," she says. It isn't like that everywhere. Brazil punches above its weight, ranking highest overall in the representation of women in science and technology, according to a report from Women in Global Science and Technology. Much of that is down to programmes that support women in the workforce, good funding for education and research and support of female entrepreneurship. South Africa and India also score well. For Ms Imafidon, it is because ITC has a very different image and status in these countries. "In India if you go into technology, it is because you want to do well and get ahead in life. If you see a well-dressed women walking down the street, you don't ask is she a lawyer or a banker but is she working in IT," she says. The aim of Stemettes and other sister organisations is to replicate in the West what is happening in the developing world. To facilitate that, the group runs events around the country aimed at getting girls interested in technology. Girls are introduced to a range of women already working in Stem subjects and are invited to take part in events such as hackathons. "We get them making mobile apps, data visualisations, having fun," says Ms Imafidon. The fact that they can do all this surrounded by other girls makes them more confident. "Coding clubs are dominated by boys. We want to make our club as normal for girls as ballet," says Ms Imafidon. At the end of the month the group will host a hackathon in Oxford, and in November it is running an exhibition at the Crystal in London's docklands. Girls aged from seven to 22 will be invited to take a variety of workshops, including dance and science, 3D printing and one on nuclear substances. The goal of Stemettes and its sister organisations is to get the women in the Stem workforce up to 30% by 2020. When you consider that women began coding 200 years ago, it seems like a fairly realistic ambition. This week saw the annual Ada Lovelace day, which every year celebrates the achievements of the Victorian woman credited with writing the first piece of code for Charles Babbage's analytical engine. The fact that Mrs Lovelace was coding in an age when even few men were, shows that there is no inherent aptitude problem, thinks Ms Imafidon. "It isn't that girls can't do it, it is that they are choosing not to do it," she says. "She was doing it 200 years ago so we have no excuse." </body>

      <title>Taiwan's older students</title>
      <description>Can the elderly save Taiwan's universities?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24566388</url>
      <date>1382051878</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70542000/jpg/_70542842_old.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Every night after dinner, many of Taiwan's older people go out to nearby parks to chat with their neighbours, or stay home to watch TV and play with the grandchildren - but not 62-year-old Yu Chin-shan. He takes his briefcase full of books and notebooks, and goes to college. The semi-retired Mr Yu owns an IT services company and has been a boss for 20 years. But now he wants to fulfil a dream he couldn't afford when he was younger. "I didn't go to college when I was young because my family didn't have the money. So I started working and eventually started a business. But I found there were many things about business management that I still wanted to learn," said Mr Yu. He is among a new wave of older people going to college for either short-term classes or degrees as Taiwan's life expectancy increases and the population ages. In 2008, Taiwan's government began offering subsidised university courses for older people, as a way to help them live more active lives. At first, older people had to be persuaded to attend college. Now they bring their friends and travel from other cities to take classes ranging from healthcare to history and law. This year, 100 universities in Taiwan have offered these courses and the older student population has shot up from about 800 in 2008 to more than 3,000 today. This is happening as many of Taiwan's 160 universities are facing declining enrolment from younger students. At Taipei's China University of Science and Technology, the student population has dropped by several hundred this year. The university had 10,000 students a few years ago, but is now down to about 9,000. Universities, who must compete for the shrinking number of students, fear that some will have to close in the coming years if the trend continues. The university blames the decline on Taiwan's low birth rate. Many young people are delaying getting married, not marrying at all, or are having fewer children or none at all. Meanwhile the island's universal health care system, which provides medical care to 99% of the population at relatively low costs for patients, is also improving health and prolonging the lives of Taiwan's people. The average lifespan in Taiwan has reached 80 years. As early as 2016, Taiwan's 65-and-overs will outnumber those under the age of 14 for the first time. By 2060, four in every 10 people on the island will be 65 or older. Tien Chen-jung, president of the China University of Science and Technology, says some institutions, including his own, are hoping to attract more older students - many of whom never had the chance to go to college, or even secondary school back in the days when Taiwan was still a developing economy. "We feel this is a huge market," Mr Tien said. "Many elderly people don't want to just stay at home all day. They have a thirst to learn. We've found that with the right programmes and good teachers, they are very happy to take classes here, and we believe they will even pay full tuition to get a degree." Enrolment among older people has increased by about 25% a year over the past few years, with nearly 1,000 enrolling last year. After taking the subsidised classes, Mr Yu became even more interested in learning. This year, he enrolled for a degree in enterprise management. "Some people might think it's too late for me to go to college, but I think it's never too late to learn. I believe in the saying, 'Live until we reach old age, learn even after we've reached old age,'" he said. "I think lifelong learning is very important. It keeps our mind active and strong." For his bachelor degree programme, Mr Yu even has to take general education courses, like his younger classmates. That includes sports. In a school gymnasium full of young students playing table tennis one night, he's clearly the only one with gray hair. But although he hasn't played in 40 years, he returns his opponent's serves almost every time. He's not only keeping up in this and other classes, he's doing better than some of his younger classmates. That's perhaps a sign of what's to come, for Taiwan's rapidly ageing society. </body>

      <description>Rwanda targets knowledge economy with tech revolution</description>

      <body>Olive Uwineza is 12 years old and dreams of becoming president one day. She sits in a class of about 30 pupils, at a high-tech primary school in Kigali, Rwanda. Each student has a green, white and orange laptop that uses cartoon animations to make lessons more fun. A lover of maths and science, Olive says tackling these subjects without computers "can make my lessons difficult". Five years ago, an initiative called One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) was introduced to the school, led by the government and NGOs. It has seen 200,000 laptops distributed in more than 400 schools across this tiny east African nation. Facilities at Olive's school have been upgraded and modernised, with access to wi-fi, and software tailored for the curriculum. The OLPC programme is one of the pillars of Rwanda's Vision 2020, which aims to turn the country into a knowledge-based economy similar to that of Singapore in South East Asia. In the wood-panelled halls of his official office, we meet President Paul Kagame, who has personally been a driver of this vision. He says information technology will help to turn Rwanda into a regional tech hub that will help Rwandans "find jobs, feed their children and regain their dignity". The tragedy of the 1994 genocide is a strong motivation for President Kagame. In his view, better access to information might have helped victims and perpetrators make different political choices. For him, the IT revolution is not only about modernising the Rwandan economy - at the core, it's about healing the nation. Mr Kagame has presided over an era of robust growth in Rwanda. Last year, the economy grew by more than 7%. Government reforms have encouraged foreign investment and the World Bank has ranked Rwanda the third best country in sub-Saharan Africa in its "Doing Business" index. But all of this could be undermined by the recent diplomatic tensions with donors. Rwanda has been accused of helping train child soldiers for rebels in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, though it has strongly rejected the allegations. In October, the US imposed sanctions on Rwanda, which may have an impact on the government's ability to pursue future economic programmes that support Vision 2020. Undeterred, government agencies continue with their work. Clare Akamanzi is the chief executive of the Rwanda Development Board, tasked with turning Vision 2020 into tangible social programmes. She says Rwanda aspires to "evolve from being an agriculture-based economy to a knowledge-based economy, mainly on high value services". In 2013 a deal was concluded with Korea Telecom to provide 4G technology across the country. At $140m (£87m) this is one of the biggest foreign direct investment deals in Rwanda. The state has laid 3,000km of fibre-optic cables over the last four years and hopes that 4G will help provide last-mile access to all communities outside of the capital, where internet connectivity is low. Clare Akamanzi says they are taking additional steps to ensure this happens. "We've built tele-centres, we've built service points, there's a communal infrastructure where we've put computers," she says. "We've also used ICT buses where we take mobile buses all over the country so people can just come and learn how to use a computer." But new technology isn't working for everyone. At a grain market on the outskirts of Kigali, traders are buying sorghum from local farmers. A mobile phone application called e-Soko was given to farmers in 2007. The app is designed to save farmers time and help them find the best deal, by sending automated text messages with the latest market prices. The farmers here, though, say they still prefer the more traditional method of face-to-face bartering. "When I call with my phone there's that possibility of an interaction," farmer Jean Baptiste Nzabamwita says. "We can bargain and say come, we can raise the price up to this one. But [with] the e-Soko... the prices are not reliable." This is just one small example of how society can sometimes resist the changes brought about by IT. Rwanda is still a largely traditional and rural country, therefore attempts to modernise the economy will have to go apace with the needs of the population at large. So does President Kagame's IT agenda come at the expense of more practical realities like healthcare, housing and rural development? His answer is simple: "The proof of the pudding is in the eating…. and we've been rewarded by progress." </body>

      <title>How bad are US debt levels?</title>
      <description>How does the US compare with other major economies?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24541140</url>

      <body>Taken out of context, the numbers are staggering. The US has a total debt pile of almost $17 trillion (£10.6 trillion), which is expected to rise to almost $23tn in the next five years. But how does that compare with other major economies? Japan is not far behind, with current debts totalling $11.5tn. By any standards, these are big, big numbers. And these countries are not alone - almost every major global economy has debts of more than a trillion dollars, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But context is needed - after all, debt is not necessarily a problem if you have the income to cover it. That is why the two most common measures used to gauge a nation's indebtedness are: Some governments actually run a surplus - in other words their income exceeds their expenses. Running a surplus is one of the best ways to reduce overall levels of debt. Looking at debt-to-GDP tells us that total US debt is roughly equivalent to its annual economic output. It is by far the largest economy in the world, and has the largest debt pile. Japan is the world's third largest economy, but its huge pile of debt is more than double its GDP. The only other country whose debts outstrip economic output is Italy, although a number of others come close - namely the UK, France and Canada. Even Germany, traditionally seen as fiscally responsible, has a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 80%. Much of this debt has been accumulated over the long term, but the numbers have rocketed in recent years as governments have struggled to cope with the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent recessions that have ravaged almost all major economies. Banking bailouts, economic stimulus measures and falling tax revenues have all forced governments to borrow more. For example, in 2007, the UK's debt pile was just 44% of GDP compared with 88% last year. This reflects in part the country's large financial sector relative to its overall economy. The US's debt-to-GDP ratio in 2007 was 64%, the same as France and Germany. By contrast, the debt-to-GDP ratio in China and India, which have seen economic slowdowns but no recession, has not moved significantly over the past five years, nor is it set to deteriorate in the next five. Indeed in the case of China, it is set to fall significantly. The picture elsewhere is less encouraging. The IMF estimates that Germany aside, those countries with high levels of indebtedness will struggle to reduce debt levels in the coming years. The UK, where the government has made much of reducing debt levels, will actually see the debt ratio edge towards 100% of GDP. One reason for this is governments' inability to move from an annual deficit to a surplus. In other words, an inability to live within their means. The IMF estimates that only Australia and China of the world's 12 largest economies will move into surplus by 2018, while Germany will increase its surplus further. Russia, it thinks, will move from a surplus to a deficit. However, most major economies are expected to make good progress in reducing their deficits. </body>

      <title>Impact of a Royal Mail strike?</title>
      <description>Contingencies and opportunity during a postal strike</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24551650</url>
      <date>1381941928</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70524000/jpg/_70524338_70521370.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>A nationwide strike of Royal Mail workers is to go ahead, says the Communication Workers Union, after its members voted four-to-one in favour of industrial action. The last time national strikes by postal workers were seen in the UK was in 2009, when a series of walkouts led to widespread disruption. It was estimated that in the first wave of nationwide strikes in 2009, there was a backlog of 30-60 million pieces of post. In the second wave, the backlog was of more than 50 million. It was also reported that some businesses suffered heavy losses, orders were unfulfilled, staff were unpaid, and some were even laid off. So what will the impact be now, in 2013? The context of the postal service has changed. In the past four years competition has boomed, and while any disruption to the six-day-a-week universal service will be unwelcome to many, this time a lot of businesses have already made other plans. Federation of Small Businesses national chairman John Allan is urging his members to start preparing now to avoid a hit on their revenues. "We would encourage businesses to look at contingency plans," he says. "Ultimately, those firms reliant on using the postal service to deliver goods will be put at a disadvantage, with consequential negative impact on their bottom lines." A glance at the websites of online retail giants such as Asos will reveal statements reassuring customers that in the event of a strike, parcels will be directed to other service providers. Amazon, the Royal Mail's biggest single business customer, said in a statement on Wednesday: "If one of our carriers was unable to provide delivery services at any time, we would employ contingency plans which include routing orders through our other carriers." These other carriers have boomed in the past few years - from UK Mail to TNT, DX Exchange, and the likes of Hermes and Yodel. Some of Royal Mail's competitors were even established, says former postal regulator executive Stephen Gibson, of SLG Economics, because of previous industrial action. "The difference really between the strikes of the recent past and now is that there is more competition now," he says. "Previous strikes became a market opportunity for companies, and after winning that business, they've kept it." David Stubbs, a postal economist, agrees that a lot has changed in the world of deliveries since 2009. He says that competitors have proved themselves reliable, especially for businesses who were reliant on the Royal Mail, such as many eBay companies. However, he says, for smaller companies, strikes could cause real problems, especially given the timing. "If there were to be more strikes, leading up to Christmas, there would be real issues," he says. "Royal Mail processes almost double the volume in December over a normal month. "For the big retailers, they will have already got other plans in place, and they will have contracts with competitor companies. However, it will be disruptive. Those competitors are already straining with deliveries." He adds that some services, such as TNT, may look to expand their network. "There is a potential that alternative postal companies may expand their end-to-end delivery networks - TNT might try and deliver more to the home," he says. "But there is some uncertainty around what Ofcom [which regulates the sector] would do in that situation - the regulator has threatened to impose universal service conditions on competing mail providers." Andrew Starkey, the head of e-logistics at IMRG, the body that represents the UK's online retailers says that more choice in service has also been matched by a surge in the volume of parcels delivered, so taking on more business contracts will be a problem. "Royal Mail has been the default carrier of choice along with the post office network while the online shopping sector has developed, and though more competition has come into the market, there is also a lot more volume," he says. He says that by the end of 2013 there will be an estimated 1.24 billion online orders generated by UK retailers and eBay traders. "There are tens of millions more orders this year than last from online retails and Royal Mail carries about 50% of them," he says. That figure rises to 90% for returns, Mr Starkey adds. "If Royal Mail goes down everything creaks." Yet Mr Starkey says that the alternative network can cope with a one-day strike. "If it's more frequent, or a week-long stoppage, then that's a problem," he says. However, he and postal economist David Stubbs agree that the increasing popularity of "click and collect", whereby online orders are collected by the customer at a local shop, will ease congestion for parcel deliveries. Mr Starkey adds: "This came into its own in the very bad snow of 2010. It caught on from that point, and for small retailers who don't have this in their own stores, their networks have grown. "There are about 12,000 outlets now. That's about the same number as there are Post Offices anyway." </body>

      <title>Schools rift 'not a crisis' - Clegg</title>
      <description>The deputy prime minister distances the Liberal Democrats from the government's free schools policy, but insists there is no "great coalition crisis" over the issue.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24599458</url>

      <body>Nick Clegg has denied there is a "great coalition crisis", ahead of a speech in which he will distance the Liberal Democrats from part of the government's policy on free schools. The deputy prime minister will argue free schools must follow the national curriculum and should not allow unqualified people to teach. But he told Sky News this was part of a "grown-up" debate between the parties. Downing Street had expressed surprise at Mr Clegg's comments. Free schools, set up by parents and other groups, are state-funded but operate outside local authority control. They were established under a policy pioneered by Education Secretary Michael Gove and since September 2011 more than 170 have been opened across England. Currently free schools have discretion over what to teach, but in his speech to a school in north London on Thursday, Mr Clegg will ask: "What's the point of having a national curriculum if only a few schools have to teach it?" His next party manifesto will also say all schools should adhere to new standards on meals and demand that teachers are either qualified or near qualification. Last week, the head teacher of a primary free school in London, who was still studying for her postgraduate certificate in education, stood down following criticism from Labour councillors. There was also controversy when the Al-Madinah free school in Derby was classed as inadequate by education inspectors. In his speech to a London school this week, Mr Clegg will say: "I'm proud of our work over the last three years to increase school autonomy, which, in government with the Conservatives, has been through the academies programme." But he will go on to question "aspects of schools policy currently affected by the priorities of the Conservative Party which I would not want to see continue". Mr Clegg will add: "Whilst I want to give schools the space to innovate, I also believe every parent needs reassurance that the school their child attends, whatever its title or structure, meets certain core standards of teaching and care. A parental guarantee, if you like." Appearing on Sky News, he said he was a supporter of free schools, but his concern was about maintaining standards. He said: "Most head teachers and parents would expect that the teachers who teach their children have the proper qualifications." Asked whether his comments were a signal that the Lib Dems were moving closer to Labour's policy, with a view to possible coalition-forming after the next general election, Mr Clegg said this was "complete and utter nonsense". He added that "tensions" were part of being in coalition and said: "It's not a political crisis when some of those differences are articulated in public." A Department for Education spokesman said free schools were "raising standards and giving parents more choice". He added: "They are run by teachers, not local bureaucrats or Westminster politicians, and are free to set their own curriculum, decide how they spend their money and employ who they think are the best people for the job. This government is not going to take these freedoms away." A Downing Street spokesman said earlier that, as recently as last week, the Lib Dem schools minister David Laws had said he was "100% behind the coalition's free schools policy, which makes Nick Clegg's comments all the more surprising". Michael Gove's allies have accused Mr Clegg of "fundamentally misunderstanding" the nature of free schools. Lib Dem sources have told the BBC that Mr Clegg argued for his proposed changes in cabinet but they were blocked by the education secretary. But Mr Clegg said current education policy was "something for Mr Gove" to handle and that he did not interfere in the workings of his department. Under plans announced by Labour, parent groups and other organisations would be able to set up schools outside local authority control, although local authorities would have greater powers to intervene when there were concerns about standards. But last week, shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said a future Labour government would allow most existing free schools to remain open. </body>

      <body>The brother-in-law of a Sheffield man who drowned in the sea off Cyprus while saving a man in difficulty has spoken of the family's loss. Keith West, 50, had been holidaying on the island with his fiancee Julie Davies while the couple planned their wedding there next year. Mr West was caught in an undercurrent on 14 October after rescuing a man. His brother-in-law, Steve Robjohns, said Mr West "would not have hesitated" to help someone in danger. "Keith was an old fashioned Yorkshireman. He was brilliant, he was true, and there wasn't a bad bone in his body. "It doesn't come as a surprise to me that he's done what he's done," said Mr Robjohns. It is believed Mr West was walking along the beach with his fiancee when he saw a man in trouble in the water and tried to help, said Mr Robjohns. He managed to save the man but was then caught by a wave and pulled under the water. Mr West had been submerged for about 10 minutes before a lifeguard found him and he could not be resuscitated. Ms Davies was "badly cut up" about her partner's death, said Mr Robjohns. "She has just had him pulled away from her and she can't get to grips with the fact she's never going to see him again," he said. "It's truly awful and all our hearts and minds go out to Julie who absolutely loved him to bits. It's truly heart-rending stuff." The Foreign Office said it was aware of the death of a British national on Cyprus and was providing consular assistance to the family. </body>

      <body>About 100 homes have been damaged by a "tornado" on Hayling Island in Hampshire, police have said. Havant Council said properties in Blackthorn Road and Ilex Walk were damaged by high winds at about 08:00 BST. The council said there were no reported injuries and its officers were assessing the damage to properties. Kayla Killshaw-Laing, who was staying on the island overnight, described the experience as "horrendous". Hampshire Constabulary has received calls regarding damaged vehicles, power lines, and beach huts. Highway teams are currently clearing up debris around the area. Ms Killshaw-Laing said: "There was this horrendous crashing sound… the dogs were barking so I went to the window and looked out and this huge tree just landed on top of my parents' car. "I was in a panic… I'm just staying here for the night, I was here to tidy their front garden, how ironic. "We've had to have chainsaws to saw the whole thing up and remove it, but the caravan flipped over next door." High winds also damaged properties several miles away in Gosport. Gaynor Wood, from the town, said: "The wind sucked the loft hatch cover into the roof space, slammed the bedroom doors and shut the window. "It was over very quickly and seems to have been extremely isolated - our house is semi-detached and yet the neighbours don't seem to have been hit. "The tiles bounced off the roof, scraped the front of the house and damaged two cars in the drive. "My husband's brand new car has had its roof pierced by roof tiles." Ian Hoult, head of emergency planning at Hampshire County Council, said a number of roofs had been damaged and trees uprooted. He said: "Fortunately we don't know of anyone being hurt, but it's an interesting situation for a Sunday morning." BBC Weather's Emma Boorman said heavy and thundery showers had moved across the area and gusts of between 45 and 50 mph were reported. She added: "The damage reported in Hayling Island is consistent with what you might expect from a small tornado, which is feasible in this weather situation." One or two tornados are typically reported along England's south coast each year, BBC Weather said.

      <title>Welby makes detour to Kenya</title>
      <description>The Archbishop of Canterbury is meeting fellow archbishops from the conservative Gafcon movement in Kenya after making a detour on his way from London to Iceland.</description>

      <body>The Archbishop of Canterbury has made a detour of more than 8,000 miles to visit Kenya - on his way to Iceland. Archbishop Justin Welby, who arrived on Saturday night, gave sermons at All Saints Cathedral on Sunday morning. He made the "last-minute" 24-hour trip to offer condolences after the Westgate centre attack, Lambeth Palace said. He is also meeting conservative Church leaders who are in Nairobi for this week's conference of the breakaway world Anglican group, Gafcon. Archbishop Welby was due to fly to Iceland - via London's Heathrow Airport - on Sunday night. In Iceland, he will attend a primates' meeting of the Porvoo Communion, formed of churches mainly in northern Europe. At least 67 people died when suspected al-Shabab militants stormed the Westgate shopping centre, in Nairobi, on 21 September. The attack sparked a four-day siege in which large parts of the shopping centre were destroyed. "The aim of the visit is to offer condolences and encouragement to the people of Kenya and those affected by the Westgate attack and to offer support to bishops in Kenya", a spokeswoman for Lambeth Palace said. The Archbishop of Canterbury stayed overnight at the home of the Archbishop of Kenya Eliud Wabukala - who is also the current chairman of Gafcon - the Global Anglican Future Conference. Archbishop Welby delivered sermons at 09:30 and 11:00 before having lunch with the Archbishop of Kenya and five Kenyan bishops. Gafcon 2013 - the second such conference - will run from Monday to Saturday. The original conference - held in Jerusalem in June 2008 - was organised in response to the appointment of actively gay men and women as bishops, especially in the US. Through the Gafcon movement, conservative Anglican provinces - mostly in parts of Africa but some in South and North America, Asia and the Middle East- have begun to function independently of the official Anglican Communion. Gafcon has condemned those who preach a "false gospel" which "claims God's blessing for same-sex unions over against the biblical teaching on holy matrimony". Lambeth Palace said the Archbishop of Canterbury was unable to accept an invitation to attend Gafcon 2013 because of his longstanding trip to Iceland and because he would be baptising Prince George at St James's Palace on Wednesday. Gafcon leaders have said the archbishop's predecessor, Dr Rowan Williams, was not forthright enough in condemning the appointment of gay bishops. The Archbishop of Kenya told BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme that Archbishop Welby was "new to us and to the communion". "I think he is interested in connecting with the activities of the communion and the Gafcon movement is part of those very significant activities that he will not miss," he added. "I think it's significant that he has recognised that fact," he added. "We hope things may not work the way they worked last time. "He has been to various parts in in Africa. He has been to Kenya before. "I think he has the experience to learn and also to be able to connect." In March, Archbishop Welby acknowledged that some gay couples have loving, stable and monogamous relationships of "stunning" quality. He told BBC News he had "particular friends where I recognise that and am deeply challenged by it". But he said he still supported the Church of England's formal opposition to active homosexuality. </body>

      <title>Minister: Police culture will change</title>
      <description>Policing will become more open, with independent overseers given more powers to stamp out wrongdoing, a Home Office minister says.</description>

      <body>The "culture" of policing will improve, with independent overseers given "more powers" to investigate wrongdoing, a Home Office minister has pledged. Damian Green said the "Plebgate" investigation was "one incident among many", citing the Hillsborough cover-up and the death of Ian Tomlinson. But only a small minority of officers had acted inappropriately, he added. The Independent Police Complaints Commission was working to ensure greater "openness", Mr Green said. A Sunday Times poll by YouGov suggests 66% of the public trust the police, down from 71% in August. The figures come after several controversies involving police over the last few years. In August the Metropolitan Police apologised to the family of Ian Tomlinson over his death at the G20 protests in London in 2009, with one officer using "excessive" force. Last year David Cameron apologised for a police cover-up over the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 football fans died in 1989. And, on Wednesday, the chief constables of West Mercia, Warwickshire and West Midlands Police are due to appear before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee to explain the handling of a meeting between officers and former government Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell. The MP resigned after he was accused of calling Downing Street police "plebs" when they prevented him from riding a bicycle through gates leading into Whitehall in September last year. The meeting with officers, working as representatives of the Police Federation, was held during the weeks following the claims. A transcript of a recording Mr Mitchell made shows that, while he admitted swearing, he denied using the word "pleb" or insulting the police. But, after the meeting, three senior police officers said he had refused to elaborate on what had happened and should quit, which he later did. Mr Green said the officers' comments had been "palpably untrue", adding: "He deserves an apology." Mr Green added: "Andrew Mitchell clearly can command the resources that other people might not be able to prove that what individual police officers said about him wasn't true. So that's the key underlying issue." Mr Green said: "If police officers behave badly then it's really serious for the police. But it's a very small minority who behave badly. By and large the police do their job well." Citing the Sunday Times poll, he added: "Two-thirds of people still have confidence in the police, which is quite surprising given the spate of stories." However, the government was increasing resources for the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) and was changing police recruitment to ensure people with a background from outside the service could enter at a senior level. Mr Green said: "The fact that people will bring a new attitude and background will help the police service. It will open it up." He added: "The IPCC needs more powers and resources, We are giving it both. It's not just a question of following rules. It's a question of having a culture of openness and transparency." Former Metropolitan Police detective Peter Kirkham told the BBC's Sunday Politics there was not a "culture of deceit" among officers. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles told BBC One's Sunday Politics he had "always believed" Mr Mitchell's account of Plebgate. "I'd be honoured to sit with Andrew Mitchell in the cabinet," he said. </body>

      <body>A counter-piracy task force commanded by a Royal Navy officer has caught a group of Somalis believed responsible for two attacks in the Indian Ocean. Pirates had exchanged gunfire with a super tanker on Friday 11 October before attacking a Spanish fishing vessel three days later. Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) traced the pirates' skiffs from Britain's Royal Fleet Auxiliary Fort Victoria. Nine men were caught and forces later destroyed two boats and equipment. Commodore Jeremy Blunden, Royal Navy, Commander of CTF-151, said: "This is an excellent result. "My multinational counter piracy forces swiftly located and dealt with this Somali pirate group, sending a clear message that piracy no longer pays." Combined Task Force (CTF) 151, as the group is known, embarked on board RFA Fort Victoria with support from Australian guided-missile frigate HMAS Melbourne and South Korean destroyer ROKS Wang Geon. The European Union flagship Dutch HNLMS Johan de Witt - flagship of the EU naval force in the area - and maritime patrol aircraft from Luxembourg were also part of the mission. After tracing the pirates an HMAS Melbourne Seahawk guided the warship to their precise location, 500 nautical miles off the Somali coast, before a boarding team made the final approach to search the skiffs. Commander Brian Schlegel, Royal Australian Navy, commanded HMAS Melbourne during the operation. He said: "It is clear that there are still pirates out there determined to generate income from taking merchant ships hostage. "Mariners have been served a timely reminder of the perils of transiting the Somali coastline." CMF is a multinational naval partnership with 29 nation members. Its aim is to promotes security, stability and prosperity across 2.5 million square miles of international waters. </body>

      <title>Welby urges energy firm 'generosity'</title>

      <body>The Archbishop of Canterbury has entered the debate about energy prices by urging firms to act with generosity, rather than just maximising profit. In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, the Most Reverend Justin Welby said he understood people who found the latest price hikes "inexplicable". The former oil executive said companies had to "justify fully" their actions. Last week, British Gas followed SSE's rises with a 9.2% increase in its dual-fuel bill price. The archbishop told the Mail on Sunday: "The impact on people, particularly on low incomes, is going to be really severe in this. "I do understand when people feel that this is inexplicable, and I can understand people being angry about it, because having spent years on a low income as a clergyman I know what it is like when your household budget is blown apart by a significant extra fuel bill and your anxiety levels become very high." Amid predictions that the four other major energy suppliers - EDF, E.On, npower, Scottish Power - will now also raise their prices, Archbishop Welby urged firms to be "conscious of their social obligations". He added they had to to "behave with generosity and not merely to maximise opportunity". "They have control because they sell something everyone has to buy. We have no choice about buying it," he said. "With that amount of power comes huge responsibility to serve society. "It is not like some other sectors of business where people can walk away from you if they don't want to buy your product and you are entitled to seek to maximise your profit. "The social licence to operate of the energy companies is something they have to take very, very seriously indeed." The archbishop, a member of the cross-party Banking Standards Commission, previously suggested the City of London has been affected by a "culture of entitlement" at variance with what others think reasonable and hit out at payday lenders charging high interest rates. He said he was concerned that fuel poverty was "a very severe issue... because real incomes are flat or declining and the cost of energy has gone up". "It ties in with the food banks and the debt," he said. "They are all part of the reality of life for many people today." The rise in energy costs has sparked a huge political debate with Labour leader Ed Miliband pledging a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. Prime Minister David Cameron has said he was "disappointed" by the rises but described Mr Miliband's plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. He has said consumers should look to switch suppliers to keep bills down. </body>

      <body>Police are looking at CCTV and speaking to witnesses in a bid to find two youngsters who they say were taken from a hotel room in Stoke-on-Trent. Na'llah Khan, two, and her 10-month-old brother, Sulailman Khan, were at the Quality Inn Hotel in Hanley. They were taken by their father, Saleem Tahir, at about 17:00 BST on Friday, police said. Officers believe all three are in Birmingham with Mr Tahir's mother Denise Smith-Sellers, 67. Police said Mr Tahir barged past an elderly relative of the children after entering their hotel room. They were last seen on the Bristol Road in Selly Oak, Birmingham at about 20:00 BST on Friday. Detectives are looking at CCTV, liaising with other forces and speaking to witnesses. In Staffordshire alone 84,000 people have seen the Facebook post on the appeal. Ch Insp Jane Hewitt, from Staffordshire Police, said: "Our priority is the safe return of the children. We believe that Saleem, Denise and the children are still in Birmingham and would urge them to contact us immediately on 101 so we can talk to them to resolve this situation." Mr Tahir, 40, is originally from the Nottingham area. </body>

      <title>Call for whistle-blowing inquiry</title>
      <description>The government should launch an inquiry into how whistle-blowers are treated in the wake of the Orchid View care home scandal, Tory MP and health select committee member Charlotte Leslie says.</description>

      <body>Ministers must launch an inquiry into how whistle-blowers are treated in the wake of the Orchid View care home scandal, MP Charlotte Leslie has said. The Tory MP spoke after Lisa Martin revealed she had not worked since exposing abuse at Orchid View in Copthorne, West Sussex, in 2011. That was "an indictment of our system", Ms Leslie told BBC Radio 5 live. The government said it would be publishing plans on protecting whistle-blowers later this year. On Friday, at an inquest into 19 deaths at Orchid View, West Sussex coroner Penelope Schofield said the home was riddled with "institutionalised abuse". She ruled that neglect contributed to five of the deaths and said the home, then run by Southern Cross, was "mismanaged and understaffed". Orchid View has since reopened under a new name and new management. Ms Martin, who first told police about problems at the home, told 5 live on Saturday: "I do want to work back in care but I can't get a job in the care industry again. "Where I live is a very small village, next to Copthorne - everyone knows what went on. "It's just been an absolute nightmare for me. "Obviously I know, morally, that I did the right things. "Whether I would ever do that again - I probably wouldn't because it's had a huge impact on my life." Conservative MP Ms Leslie, who is also a member of the health select committee, told 5 live's Sunday Breakfast that Ms Martin's experience was "absolutely appalling but sadly it's becoming a recurring theme". "Whistle-blowers across the NHS and the care system do the right thing, stand up and save lives, in many cases. "And then other future employers look at them and, instead of saying, 'thank goodness - here's someone who can prevent bad things happening', they look at them and say 'here's a troublemaker'. "People who are saving lives are losing their jobs, losing their livelihoods and everything." She added: "That's why I think a whistle-blowing inquiry or review is needed into how we can ensure that whistle-blowing isn't needed - because management systems iron out these things before it gets to whistle-blowing - and how you can protect whistle-blowers." A spokesperson for the Department of Health (DoH) said staff in the health and social care sectors "should never be stopped from raising concerns about patient safety and the secretary of state for health has told trusts that doing this is unacceptable". "Staff should be able to speak out and we are determined to ensure that if individuals raise concerns about patient safety they are listened to," they added. The department said that, later this year, it would publish its response to a public inquiry report released in February into failings at Stafford Hospital which came after years of neglect led to the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of patients. Its response to the inquiry would "lay out how we plan on making sure whistle-blowers are not just protected but also praised for their courage and thanked by management". That would form "a key part of the effort to build the safe, effective and compassionate culture that patients, the public and the overwhelming majority of staff across health and social care expect", the spokesperson added. </body>

The light aircraft was brought down near Halfpenny Green, on the border of Staffordshire and Shropshire, hitting the ground nose first before flipping over. One man, in his 60s, escaped uninjured from the crash, at about 12:10 BST. Firefighter Mark Weaver said the pilot took the decision to bring the plane down to avoid hitting houses in the nearby village of Bobbington. He said it eventually landed about 400ft (120m) from the nearest house. Staff at nearby Halfpenny Green Airport were able to free the occupant of the plane before fire crews arrived. A Staffordshire Fire Service spokesman said they responded to a light aircraft that had crashed on the approach to the runway. He said: "When we arrived we found it to be in the field. There had been a heavy landing but the pilot was up and walking about when we left the scene. "He was left with the police and breathalysed." </body>

      <body>The brother of a British man killed with his wife and mother-in-law while on holiday in the Alps has denied arranging their murder. Zaid al-Hilli, from Surrey, has accused French police of "covering up" the real target of the killings in 2012 and also offered to take a lie-detector test. He remains on bail after being arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. The French prosecutor said he was convinced there was a very serious feud between the brothers. Saad al-Hilli and his wife Iqbal, from Claygate, her mother Suhaila al-Allaf and French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, were shot on 5 September 2012. The bodies of the four victims were found on a remote forest road in Chevaline near Lake Annecy. The two young daughters survived the attack, one by hiding under her dead mother's skirt. Saad's brother Zaid, who is from Chessington, was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder amid claims he doctored documents to ensure he inherited the family estate following the death of their father. Zaid denied arranging the killings and said the accusations were "ridiculous." He rejected claims of a feud between the brothers over the inheritance. He said they got on well despite only communicating through their lawyers in the eleven months before the attack. "Our relationship was very brotherly and very close, and we looked after each other," he said. He declined to answer questions about his father's will because British police are investigating him for possible fraud. He said French police shut down their investigation into the murder of the cyclist, Sylvain Mollier, too soon. "They are covering up for someone in France in that region and they know it. "Sylvain Mollier was involved in family disputes and was an outsider to [his] rich family. There is something more to it locally... most crime has local roots." The French prosecutor, Eric Maillaud, has said he is sure the cyclist was there by accident and is convinced there was a feud between the brothers. "The police have investigated Sylvain Mollier's family as far as they could. There is nothing to link Mollier to this murder," he said. "The investigators have become convinced that Zaid tried to steal from his father, one way or another, and that there was a very serious feud between the two brothers. "Saad al-Hilli was afraid of his brother and had changed the locks at the house and fitted a new alarm." Mr Maillaud said French investigators will solve the mystery of the Annecy murders however long it takes.

      <title>Protest at Shankill bomber memorial</title>
      <description>A memorial ceremony for an IRA man who died while planting a bomb, killing himself and nine other people 20 years ago, is taking place in Belfast as loyalists protest against the commemoration.</description>

      <body>A memorial ceremony for an IRA man who died while planting a bomb, killing himself and nine other people 20 years ago, is taking place in Belfast. Thomas Begley was responsible for the Shankill Road bombing in October 1993. He was carrying the device into a shop when it exploded prematurely. The bomber's father unveiled a plaque during the commemoration ceremony which was organised by Begley's friends. A loyalist protest against the event is taking place on Belfast's Crumlin Road. Some of Begley's victims have criticised the commemoration, saying it has added to their grief. The nine other people killed in the IRA attack were all Protestant civilians, including two children age seven and 13. Begley's father mentioned the pain of the people of the Shankill Road as he unveiled the plaque at the commemoration in north Belfast on Sunday afternoon. The plaque states that the bomber "died on active service" and is "always remembered by his many comrades and friends". It also includes a quote from the former IRA leader, Seamus Twomey. The crowd was also addressed by Sean Kelly, the IRA man who was with Begley on the day and survived the bomb. The attack took place on a busy Saturday afternoon in the heart of one of Belfast's best known loyalist areas. Begley and his IRA accomplice, Kelly, posed as fishmongers and carried the bomb into Frizzell's fish shop where shoppers were queuing for food. In addition to the 10 deaths, a further 57 people were injured by the bomb. They included Kelly, who was pulled from the rubble of the collapsed building. Kelly received a total of nine life sentences for his role in the attack but was released early in July 2000, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. Families of some of the Shankill bomb victims condemned the commemoration when the plans emerged earlier this month. A flyer advertising the memorial, which stated also that Begley had "died on active service" caused controversy when it was circulated on social media. The Begley family, from Ardoyne in north Belfast, have previously publically stated their opposition to the Shankill Road bombing and their son's role in the IRA attack. Last week, the bomber's brother, Sean Begley, told the Belfast Newsletter that his family had not been involved in producing the flyer or the plaque tribute, but would be attending the memorial service to mark the 20th anniversary of his death. Michelle Williamson, who lost both her parents in the explosion, wrote a personal letter to Begley's parents, asking them to call off the ceremony. She told them she had "no problem in acknowledging your loss" but said the unveiling of the plaque to a bomber was "a sick and cruel insult to the memory of our loved ones". Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams, who caused outrage among victims when he carried Begley's coffin in 1993, was asked about the commemoration as he attended a peace conference in London on Saturday. Mr Adams told the BBC: "I think we have to be very sensitive about all of this. Thomas Begley has a family, those families arguably are victims. "One could argue that Thomas Begley is not a victim because he was engaged in an IRA operation at the time," the Sinn Féin leader said. "My understanding of this is that, it is a group of friends and family members who simply want, in a very dignified and respectful way - not in any way celebration or triumphalism or any of the rest of it. "The Shankill Road bombing, we all know inflicted awful hurt upon the people who were killed and those people who were injured. "So I'm very mindful, as we seek to build the future, that we have to deal the the past, and part of the problem for victims is that the past is the present. "It's not going away, so we need to be ultra, ultra careful and sensitive to everybody's feelings in this situation," Mr Adams added. </body>

      <body>Workers at the Grangemouth refinery have held a rally outside the plant amid the continuing dispute which has seen the plant go into shutdown. It comes as First Minister Alex Salmond urged operators Ineos to "fire up the plant and do it now". Ineos has asked the Unite union to make a commitment to call no further industrial action this year. Unite said it would agree, but on the condition that Ineos would not impose cuts planned for the same period. Management and unions failed to reach a deal on Friday which could see operations restart. The plant was shut down last week as a result of the dispute, which came close to industrial action by the union. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme, Mr Salmond said: "I think Unite should give a no strike - without strings - guarantee. "Once that is done Ineos should fire up the plant and then the various discussions, negotiations, consultations on terms and conditions, should take place against the background of a working plant, not a plant that is lying cold." He added: "Let's get the plant up and running so that everybody has a vested interest in coming to terms in a plant that is working, as opposed to this current situation, which is wholly dangerous for the workforce and the Scottish economy, of a plant that is lying cold." Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scottish secretary, said: "Rather than demonstrating, workers want to be working to make sure that Grangemouth has a successful future. Instead their livelihoods are being thrown into turmoil because of Ineos' irresponsibility which risks the future of the site. "Anger is growing among workers and the company now risks destroying good Scottish jobs and a powerhouse of the Scottish economy." He added: "Once again I call on Ineos to drop the cynical blackmail, start the plant up and talk seriously about securing a future for Grangemouth." Unite has published a strongly-worded advert in a number of Scottish Sunday newspapers titled: "A message to the people of Scotland". It described Grangemouth as the "powerhouse" of Scotland's economy and urged management to open the plant. The advert said: "This climate of fear has been created to try to force working men and women into signing away their rights and the pensions which they have saved all their working lives. "This is a company out of control. This is holding Scotland to ransom." The advert asked people to support the workforce and contact MPs and MSPs. Ineos said the dispute had cost it £20m on top of monthly losses of £10m. The company has warned that the plant would close in 2017 without fresh investment and changes to workers' terms and conditions. It has put forward a survival plan for the site and asked workers to back changes to their contracts and conditions as part of the proposals by 18:00 on Monday ahead of a shareholders meeting on Tuesday. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Ineos chairman Jim Ratcliffe said the fate of the Grangemouth site rested with the workforce. He said: "This is not a bluff. The clock is ticking, Grangemouth could have a future but that is absolutely in the hands of the workers." Gordon Grant, Ineos site manager at Grangemouth, said: "We have to address the facts and the facts are that we need the survival plan to have a long-term future, a very, very good long-term future for Grangemouth, and for Scotland. "That's what we are putting forward and that's what we are asking our employees to support." The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans. </body>

      <body>Stars including Simon Pegg and Matt Lucas have expressed their sorrow at the death of comic and actor Felix Dexter, who died on Friday of cancer. The St Kitts-born Londoner, 52, had suffered from myeloma, a type of bone marrow cancer. Star Trek and Shaun of the Dead star Pegg tweeted: "Very sad to hear news of his passing. Very funny man." Little Britain's Lucas added that the Real McCoy star was: "A brilliant performer and ...a very nice man." Comedian and QI panellist Alan Davis added his voice to the tributes, saying that his memories of Dexter went back a long way. He tweeted: "Sad and shocked to hear about Felix Dexter passing away. So many gigs with him back in the olden days. Always a pleasure. RIP Felix." Fellow comic and presenter Dara O Briain linked on Twitter to a clip of Dexter performing as "the accountant" in 90s flagship black comedy The Real McCoy, adding he was "so sad" to hear the news. Comedian and star of The Infidel Omid Djalili described Dexter as "one of the very few who made me howl", while actor David Schneider tweeted: "Lovely, lovely guy. And I think nothing on TV has ever made me laugh more than his Real McCoy Nigerian character", referencing the Real McCoy clip linked to by O Briain. Actor David Morrissey, who has starred in TV series The Walking Dead and State of Play, said he worked with Dexter a while ago, describing him as a "funny, talented and generous man". Comedian Jenny Eclair added: "Terribly sad news about a very nice man who did a lot of fabulous work." Former Brookside star Louis Emerick said Dexter was a "very funny, talented man, gentleman!" tweeting: "Gone too soon." Dexter moved to the UK when he was aged seven and came to prominence in The Real McCoy and later performed for a season with the Royal Shakespeare Company. More recently, he played three of the main roles in BBC Two's sketch show Bellamy's People and is currently appearing in Citizen Khan. The Fast Show's Paul Whitehouse acted with Dexter in Bellamy's People. Whitehouse told BBC Radio 5 live he was privileged to be close to the comedian and actor. "He was a very modest, a very private man," he said. "It was an honour to be close to him. "He stuck in people's minds, Felix. There's been such an outpouring of warmth and affection for him." </body>

      <title>Depp gives award to Christopher Lee</title>
      <description>Actor Sir Christopher Lee says receiving his British Institute Fellowship from Johnny Depp was a "very emotional moment", as Ida, a depiction of the Holocaust, wins the best film prize at London Film Festival.</description>

      <body>Hammer horror star Sir Christopher Lee said it was a "very emotional moment" when he received his British Institute Fellowship from his friend Johnny Depp. He tearfully accepted the award at the London Film Festival, saying: "I didn't know you were going to be here. I must try and pull myself together." The prize for best film went to to Pawel Pawlikowski's Ida, about German occupation of Poland and the Holocaust. Screenwriter Jonathan Asser won best British newcomer. He took the accolade for his debut feature Starred Up, about the practice of placing violent young offenders prematurely in adult prison. BFI fellow and film critic Philip French said of Ida that the jury was "deeply moved by a courageous film that handles, with subtlety and insight, a painfully controversial historical situation". Sir Christopher, 91, who described receiving his award as "a great joy", is famed for his villainous portrayals of Bond bad guy Scaramanga and evil wizard Saruman in The Lord of the Rings. He has amassed more than 250 screen credits, including The Wicker Man, The Man with the Golden Gun and more recently, several Tim Burton films including Sleepy Hollow, which starred Depp. He also played Count Dooku in the Star Wars prequels. Depp, who sneaked into the awards ceremony to surprise his friend, said it was his "great honour" to present the award to "a very great man", saying he had been "fascinated and inspired" by him. "He's been a wonderful individual and over the years I've had the pleasure of working with him and it has been a childhood dream come true," he said. "But as great as it is to work with him, that pleasure doesn't compare with getting to know him and being able to count him as a true friend. "A national treasure and a genuine artist. I love ya!" Sir Christopher responded by saying: "I can't thank you enough," in reference to Depp, who he had been told could not make the occasion as he was elsewhere. He went on : "When I take a look back, and it's a long one, 67 years, at the characters I've played I get a truly strange feeling they were all played by somebody else, and not by me. "And there are a few occasions when it has been the case I wish it had!" He said of Depp: "He means an enormous amount to me. He is one of very few young actors on screen today who's truly a star. "Everything he does has a meaning. He's a joy to work with, an actor's dream and certainly a director's dream. I could go on a long time but I'd probably embarrass him." The festival presented the Sutherland Award, for the most original and imaginative film debut, to Anthony Chen, who directed Ilo Ilo, which explores the life and vulnerabilities of a modern affluent family in Singapore. The Grierson award for the best documentary went to Paul-Julien Robert's My Fathers, My Mother and Me, a portrayal of life in Friedrichshof, the largest commune in Europe, which was founded in the 70s. The film reveals the devastating emotional effects of life there on its residents, and jury president Kate Ogborn said the "disturbing film" raised "larger questions of power, parental responsibility and abuse". The film festival closes later with the world premiere of Saving Mr Banks, a dramatisation of the making of 1964 movie Mary Poppins starring Emma Thompson as author PL Travers and Tom Hanks as Walt Disney. Hanks appeared at Bafta's London headquarters on Saturday to give a Life in Pictures talk, during which he revealed some of the difficulties he faced playing "Uncle Walt" on screen. "Walt Disney died of lung cancer; he smoked three packs a day," the two-time Oscar winner told host Francine Stock. "But can we show him smoking in a major motion picture these days? No way in hell. "It's this thing that has happened in movies - real people can't smoke. We literally had a negotiation over whether I could hold a lit cigarette in a scene." In a wide-ranging discussion covering his 30-year film career, Hanks said his success was partly down to his not having "a bigger-than-life persona". "I'm charming as hell, but I don't strike fear and I don't have a huge amount of mystery," he explained. "You're not worried about me killing you, or stealing your daughter, or being some sort of criminal mastermind. "I view myself as a guy that if I had been a good student, I could be a historian," he continued. "And if I had been good at science, I could be a doctor. "I'm not good at any of those things so I'm an actor. These movies, these roles, they're always something that - if I was a little more accomplished - I could be that guy." Hanks can currently be seen in cinemas in Captain Phillips, which opened the London Film Festival on 9 October. Saving Mr Banks is out in the UK on 29 November. </body>

      <body>A life-size bronze statue of comedy character Frank Sidebottom has been unveiled in his hometown of Timperley in Greater Manchester. The character with a huge papier mache head was the alter-ego of musician and comedian Chris Sievey, who died in 2010. Fans raised £60,000 for the tribute which was made in a Czech foundry. Hundreds of people attended an unveiling ceremony earlier, many in fancy dress for the occasion. Neil Taylor, who helped raise the donations for the statue, said its installation would mean that "Frank will gaze on the Timperley sunset forever". He said: "You either got the humour or you didn't get the humour. "Frank Sidebottom created a whole world, he was just magical. He just made a very modest living entertaining people and that's what he's enjoying doing." Sievey set his character's life in the village, where he lived himself, and, as Frank, hosted tours of the area for fans. He often referenced Timperley in his TV and music work, notably on his 1987 release, The Timperley EP, which featured a version of The Kinks' 1967 song Waterloo Sunset with altered lyrics that referred extensively to the village. He also covered Sex Pistols' Anarchy in the UK, changing its title to Anarchy in Timperley. Although best known for Frank Sidebottom, Sievey also had success in the late 1970s with his punk band The Freshies, who had a hit with I'm In Love With The Girl On The Manchester Virgin Megastore Checkout Desk. His TV fame peaked in the early 1990s with his own series Frank Sidebottom's Fantastic Shed Show. Next year Michael Fassbender will play Frank Sidebottom in Frank, a movie inspired by the character. </body>

      <title>Anger as diabetic children miss out</title>
      <description>Some health boards are not following mandatory guidelines by failing to provide insulin pumps to children with type 1 diabetes, BBC Wales finds.</description>

      <body>Some health boards in Wales are not following mandatory guidelines by failing to provide insulin pumps to children with type 1 diabetes, BBC Wales has found. Pumps change the lives of diabetics by removing the need for daily injections and must be provided if needed. But BBC Wales has found there are 29 young patients in Wales waiting for insulin pump therapy. The Welsh government said it expected health boards to follow the guidelines. BBC Radio Wales current affairs programme Eye On Wales spoke to the Children's Commissioner for Wales who said it could be a breach of the children's human rights. There are two kinds of diabetes. Type 2 accounts for 90% of cases - and 10% of NHS spending - and is linked to lifestyle, obesity and age. Type 1 diabetes has no link to lifestyle choices and occurs when the pancreas fails to produce the insulin the body needs to process glucose. It is managed by measuring the sugar in the bloodstream and then giving the body the insulin it needs to survive. There are approximately 16,000 people with type 1 diabetes in Wales and 1,400 of them are children and young people. Nine-year-old Emily Agutter, from Usk in Monmouthshire, has to test her blood sugar levels and inject herself with insulin several times a day after being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes over a year ago. She does not like the injections and would like to try an insulin pump but her health board has told her family she cannot have one yet. Emily has been waiting for 10 months despite the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines which say one should be provided. Her father, Neil Agutter, who also has type 1 diabetes, has an insulin pump. "It makes me incredibly angry - it's there in black and white," Mr Agutter said. "We have asked and there are funding issues in terms of resources for the hospital. "The hospital doctors and nurses who treat Emily are lovely and they do a great job. We've just been told they can't do it yet, there's too many people waiting. And when somebody's nine years old, it's a long time for somebody so young." Emily is not the only child with type 1 diabetes waiting for an insulin pump in Wales. Eye on Wales has learned that three health boards have children on a waiting list - Emily's own board, Aneurin Bevan, has 15 youngsters waiting while Cardiff and Vale has 11 and Hywel Dda, three. "If you're on a waiting list then I think you could take a pretty clear view that that's a breach of that child's rights," said the Children's Commissioner for Wales Keith Towler. "Now if the child wants the pump and the family are happy for the child to have the pump, then actually sort out the resource issues later if you have to, but actually just make that pump available. "This is a life-changing diagnosis for a child and that child needs as much support as they can possibly get. Let's take it right back to the child and make sure that the child gets that service." Aneurin Bevan Health Board said while it could not comment on individual cases it was committed to increasing access to insulin pump therapy as a treatment option. The board said it planned to increase the number of children on the therapy from 33 to 90 over the next two years. Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: "I'm afraid just in the practical world, it won't always be the case that the minute someone has been assessed for an insulin pump that that pump will immediately be available..." He said staff were also required to make sure the pump was "successfully used". "So I would expect anybody who has been assessed that every effort is made at local health board level to make the period of time they have to wait between being assessed for suitability and getting the pump to be short as possible," he said. "I certainly expect the health boards will follow mandatory NICE guidance, that they have to find ways within their very stretched budgets to be able to do that." He said the Welsh NHS spent £500m a year on diabetes, and health boards had to prioritise and put the money where it was most needed. Eye on Wales is on BBC Radio Wales on Sunday, 20 October at 12:00 BST. </body>

      <title>Rail disruption during major events</title>
      <description>The first minister criticises the timing of engineering work on the Severn Tunnel during two major events in Cardiff.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-24585000</url>

      <body>The first minister has criticised Network Rail over the closure of the Severn Tunnel during two major events in Cardiff. The tunnel will close for maintenance work on the same weekend as the opening ceremony for the Rugby League World Cup, and the Womex music festival. Speaking to BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme, Carwyn Jones said Network Rail had not consulted the Welsh government over the closure. Network Rail said it was vital work. But Mr Jones said: "They've got form on this. It's an important point here - when we've got events in Cardiff, why do maintenance work on the Severn Tunnel when those events are taking place? "If there were events taking place every single week in the Millennium Centre, the Millennium Stadium or the [Cardiff] City Stadium, you might say 'okay, there are some weekends when that's inevitable' but for some reason they choose weekends when there are big events taking place in Cardiff." The Severn Tunnel - which runs under the River Severn on the south Wales-London mainline - will be closed for maintenance on the weekend of 26-27 October - the same weekend as the Rugby League World Cup opening ceremony at the Millennium Stadium and Womex world music festival at the Millennium Centre. Mr Jones believes the closures will cause travel problems, having a negative impact on the world-wide image of Wales. He said a similar closure in 1999 caused problems for fans travelling to and from the Wales v England rugby international at Wembley Stadium in London. Mr Jones added that he recognised the need for maintenance and regretted that an alternative rail route was not considered when the second Severn bridge was built. "The big problem is of course that a rail deck wasn't put on the Severn Bridge in 1993 - other countries would have done that - and we wouldn't have these problems with the Severn Tunnel," said the first minister. "Yes it needs maintenance. It's a very wet tunnel [I know] having been through there in a cab of a 125 [train], but let's do it when there's not a big game on in Cardiff." In a statement Network Rail told Sunday Politics Wales: "There is never a good time to do work on the Severn Tunnel and we thoroughly investigated the Welsh government's request. "In this instance, this six-week works package was planned two years in advance and had already been put back a week to accommodate the one-day cricket match between England and Australia in September. "This vital project cannot be put back any further and to cancel it would have a negative impact on services from south Wales to London." Network Rail added it had assured the organisers of the 2015 Rugby Union World Cup that it would not schedule any disruptive work during the period the tournament was on at the Millennium Stadium. Sunday Politics Wales is on BBC One Wales at 11:00 BST on Sunday, 20 October. </body>

      <title>Corroboration 'must go' for justice</title>
      <description>Scotland's justice secretary voices his determination to get rid of the need for evidence in criminal trials to come from two sources, despite opposition.</description>

      <body>Scotland's justice secretary has voiced his determination to get rid of the need for evidence in criminal trials to come from two sources. Kenny MacAskill told the SNP conference dropping the centuries-old requirement for corroboration meant people would no longer have to suffer in silence. Sections of the legal profession oppose the move and the SNP's Christine Grahame has urged caution. But Mr MacAskill said criminal law had to be brought into the 21st Century. Proposals to drop the general requirement for corroboration are part of a series of justice reforms which have been put forward by the Scottish government. Supporters say the plan could improve conviction rates in areas such as sex crime and domestic abuse cases. But opponents argue corroboration provides an important safeguard against miscarriages of justice. Addressing delegates in Perth, Mr MacAskill said: "We need to address the historic anomaly of the routine requirement for corroboration. "Those who suffer rape and other serious sexual assault are denied justice by it. "But it's not just the victims of these horrendous sexual crimes, but many others, whether children or the elderly - crimes committed without eyewitnesses." The justice secretary went on: "Of the latest shameful statistics on domestic abuse, 10% of crimes reported to the Crown couldn't be prosecuted because of the lack of corroboration. "And those were only the ones the police reported - many others didn't even make it to the fiscal's office as they knew the Crown couldn't pursue them." Mr MacAskill said the abolition of corroboration would come hand-in-hand with additional safeguards including a "qualitative and quantitive" test for prosecutions and increasing the majority required by juries for a conviction. He said: "Justice there must be and corroboration must go." Ms Grahame, convener of the Scottish Parliament's cross-party justice committee, which is scrutinising the government's proposals, has warned any changes must be for the benefit of the complainer and accused, not because they are "politically popular". </body>

      <body>Thousands of people are facing waiting lists of up to nine years for a local authority allotment, the Scottish Greens have said. In Edinburgh the wait can be between four and nine years, while in Aberdeen the wait can stretch up to seven years. The figures were disclosed in response to freedom of information requests by Green MSP Alison Johnstone to local authorities covering Scotland's cities. Ms Johnstone called for new "right-to-grow" legislation. There were 2,773 people in Edinburgh on the local authority allotment waiting list. In Aberdeen the figure was 279, while in Dundee it was 340 people. Glasgow City Council said it did not have its own waiting lists and Highland Council did not respond to the request, the Greens said. Perth and Kinross Council replied that it did not have any allotments and Stirling Council has only one site which has no waiting list. Ms Johnstone, MSP for Lothian and food spokeswoman for the Greens, also highlighted official statistics showing that almost 31% of Scotland's population lived within 500m of a derelict site last year. "These figures suggest Scotland needs right-to-grow legislation in the same way we have seen community groups being given the right to buy land that comes up for sale," she said. "I will be looking for opportunities in the forthcoming Community Empowerment Bill to give control to the increasing numbers of people looking to grow their own food because the demand is there, the land is there and the benefits are obvious." Scotland has more than 200 allotment sites, mostly council-owned. In 2008, the Scottish government asked public bodies to consider how they could free up land to increase the number of allotments in Scotland. Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead said: "Growing your own food is continuing to grow in popularity and allotments provide a range of benefits such as an opportunity to learn new skills, an understanding of where our food comes from and better health. "We consulted earlier this year on plans to simplify Scotland's allotment rules, including using unused and underused assets. We are currently considering what changes could be made to the existing legislation and will set out our proposals in the coming weeks. " </body>

      <body>More than 6,000 runners have taken part in a new marathon in York organised by the family of Jane Tomlinson. The Yorkshire Marathon was set up by Jane Tomlinson's Run For All, which the Leeds fundraiser's family launched after she died of cancer in 2007. The marathon's 26.2 mile (42km) route passed several landmarks in York and went through villages in North Yorkshire and the East Riding. Edwin Korir, from Kenya, won the men's race in two hours and 13 minutes. The race was expected to raise more than £1.3m for charities, organisers said. Mrs Tomlinson undertook a series of fundraising sporting challenges after being told her cancer was terminal in 2000. She had raised more than £1.5m by the time of her death. Jane Tomlinson's Run For All already stages Leeds, York, Hull and Pennine-Lancashire 10k races and the Leeds half marathon. An additional 600 places were made available for the inaugural Yorkshire Marathon after an initial 5,500 were snapped up within three days earlier this year by runners from all over the world. The race started and finished at the University of York, with runners passing York's city walls, the famous Betty's tea rooms and York Minster. Lynne Preston, the marathon's lead organiser, said it was "really special" for the city. "In York we have a city with amazingly spectacular scenery, but one that is also extremely flat which should make for a really fast course," she said. Double Paralympic gold medallist Hannah Cockroft, from Halifax, who took part in the event, said the marathon built on Yorkshire's showing in the 2012 Olympics. She said: "Last summer proved that Yorkshire was the best county for sport in Britain and now that Yorkshire has its very own marathon, people can come and share in the legacy that was created." </body>

      <body>A boy of 14 and an 18-year-old man arrested in connection with three sexual assaults near the University of Manchester have been released. They must return to a police station later for further questioning, Greater Manchester Police said. Officers had earlier released an e-fit of a boy, who they said could have been as young as 12, who they believed may have carried out the attacks. The police said they would continue to investigate the "appalling incidents". In the first incident, a 27-year-old was approached from behind and grabbed in Lloyd Street North at 18:15 BST. The woman screamed and the offender, who was described as being in his mid-teens and mixed race, threatened her. He grabbed her again before running away. The next incident followed minutes later when a 21-year-old woman was approached by a boy who made lewd comments as she left John Rylands University Library and walked along Oxford Road. She carried on walking on to Moss Lane East and was sexually assaulted by her assailant. The third attack took place at the Manchester Science Park in Lloyd Street North at about 14:15 BST on 5 October. A 32-year-old woman was using her mobile phone when she was approached by two young boys. She was sexually assaulted by one of the boys, who was described as being slim, Asian, wearing baggy trousers and carrying a rucksack, and aged about 12 or 13 years old. She pushed him away but he sexually assaulted her again before running off towards Pencroft Way with the second young boy, who was also described as being Asian. Det Ch Insp Colin Larkin thanked members of the public and the media "for their support and the information they have provided". He said he wanted to reassure the community that officers would "continue to investigate these appalling incidents so we so can establish all the facts and who is responsible". He added that he would like anyone who had any more information about the three attacks or any other incidents to come forward. </body>

      <body>England lock Courtney Lawes impressed as Northampton beat Ospreys to go second in Pool One of the Heineken Cup. A Samu Manoa try and Stephen Myler conversion and penalty gave Northampton the lead before Dan Biggar landed two penalties for the visitors. Christian Day's converted try made it 17-6 at the break, only for Ospreys to hit back through a try, conversion and penalty from Biggar. But Ben Foden added a third Northampton try and Myler's boot saw Saints home. The hosts will be frustrated not to have secured a bonus point for scoring four tries, with George Pisi held a couple of feet short from a last-gasp Northampton attack, but in the end they were convincing winners. Lawes, along with fellow England forwards Dylan Hartley and Tom Wood, was outstanding in all facets of the game, although the lock's work at the line-out and in the tackle - he made 20 - was particularly noteworthy. And the 6ft 7in second row set the tone from the first whistle as he drilled Tom Habberfield backwards when the Ospreys scrum-half caught the kick-off. George North then hammered into midfield and an Ospreys offside gave Myler the chance to kick the hosts into the lead. When Manoa picked up from the base of a five-metre scrum and went over untouched, with Myler converting, with less than 15 minutes played it seemed as though Northampton were set for an easy win. But Ospreys, who went into the game on the back of a disappointing home defeat by Leinster, were determined to put up a fight and two Biggar penalties cut the gap to four points. However, Northampton were looking by far the more threatening side and they added to their lead almost immediately. Luther Burrell made a couple of big carries into midfield before the hosts went wide and Lawes - who had started things with a soaring line-out take - sent second row partner Day over in the corner for a converted score. It was turning into a spectacular game, with Northampton fizzing the ball about at pace but unable to finish things off, and the visitors prepared to counter-attack whenever they were presented with the opportunity. They turned round 17-6 down, needing to score next if the match was not to run away from them, and they duly lifted their game after the restart. Captain Alun Wyn Jones was at the heart of their charge and after he was held inches short, Biggar wriggled his way over by the posts before adding the conversion. Suddenly there were only four points in it and Northampton's cause was not helped as Myler missed a simple penalty, but approaching the hour mark they stretched clear again. The Saints pack bullied their way to within inches of the line from a line-out drive before Lee Dickson sent full-back Foden over unopposed. Myler converted from out wide and an exchange of penalties by the two fly-halves concluded the scoring, with a potentially important fourth try for Saints proving elusive.

      <description>A double from Kris Doolan ensures Inverness suffer their first home defeat of the season in a controversial match in the Highlands.</description>

      <body>A double from Kris Doolan ensured Inverness suffered their first home defeat of the season in a controversial match in the Highlands. Doolan put Partick ahead, firing low under Dean Brill after 20 minutes. Aaron Doran thought he had levelled but the goal was ruled out after officials ordered a corner to be re-taken. Gary Warren's header restored parity after the break but hosts' goalkeeper Brill fumbled a cross to give Doolan a simple tap-in to claim the win. With Partick having encounters against Aberdeen and Celtic to come, manager Alan Archibald will have been delighted to grab a vitally important victory. But where luck had perhaps evaded them in recent weeks, they certainly got the fortune in this game, with a contentious refereeing decision and Brill's gift to Doolan shortly before the end. Second-placed Inverness will have felt aggrieved to have the lost the match with Celtic dropping points on Saturday. However, on the evidence of the opening period they might have thought their home record would be safe as they took the game to the visitors. Doran came close with a free-kick before Ben Greenhalgh, starting his first game and eager to impress, saw his effort cannon off the post. However, it was Partick's Doolan, having received a James Craigen cutback, who showed the coolness and composure to fizz a shot past Brill to give the Jags the lead. Partick were quite content to let Inverness have possession, but Archibald's men threatened on the counter on several occasions. Craigen had time and space on the edge of the box and attempted to curl a shot towards goal, however, he failed to find the target. Stephen O'Donnell was next to try his luck as they flooded forward once more, but his effort was also wayward. However, then the game's talking point arose just before half-time when Inverness thought they had found an equaliser. A training ground corner led to Doran dinking the ball across to Billy McKay, whose effort was cleared off the line before Doran rifled past a flurry of defenders and Scott Fox in goal. But referee Euan Norris disallowed the strike and brought play back, insisting that Ross Draper's initial touch at the corner flag had not restarted play, much to the fury of the Inverness players. Their feeling of injustice spurred them on though and it was not long before they found an equaliser shortly after the break when Warren powered a header beyond Fox and into the net. It seemed as though Inverness were starting to assert their authority on the game as Partick were struggling to deal with the aerial power they posed. And they looked vulnerable when Richie Foran rose above Isaac Osbourne to head into the net, but the official blew his whistle for an infringement. Inverness spurned more chances though Draper and Foran as they looked to keep their 100% home record intact. However, it was a howler from Brill who gave Doolan the simplest of chances to knock the ball in from a yard and give Partick the three points. </body>

      <title>Where the penalty for miscarriage is jail</title>

      <body>El Salvador has one of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the world. A side-effect is that women who suffer miscarriages are sometimes suspected of inducing an abortion - and can even be jailed for murder. Glenda Xiomara Cruz was crippled by abdominal pain and heavy bleeding in the early hours of 30 October 2012. The 19-year-old from Puerto El Triunfo, eastern El Salvador, went to the nearest public hospital where doctors said she had lost her baby. It was the first she knew about the pregnancy as her menstrual cycle was unbroken, her weight practically unchanged, and a pregnancy test in May 2012 had been negative. Four days later she was charged with aggravated murder - intentionally murdering the 38-to-42 week foetus - at a court hearing she was too sick to attend. The hospital had reported her to the police for a suspected abortion. After two emergency operations and three weeks in hospital she was moved to Ilopango women's prison on the outskirts of the capital San Salvador. Then last month she was sentenced to 10 years in jail, the judge ruling that she should have saved the baby's life. Her lawyer, Dennis Munoz Estanley, says the legal system has an inbuilt "presumption of guilt" making it hard for women to prove their innocence. "She is yet another innocent victim of our unjust and discriminatory legal system which jails poor, young women who suffer obstetric complications for murder on the most flimsy evidence," he says. Xiomara's father describes the conviction as a "terrible injustice". He testified in court that his daughter had endured years of domestic violence at the hands of her partner. And yet the prosecution - which sought a 50-year jail term - relied heavily on this man's allegation that she had intentionally killed the foetus. Xiomara has not seen her four-year-old daughter since the miscarriage. El Salvador is one of five countries with a total ban on abortion, along with Nicaragua, Chile, Honduras and Dominican Republic. Since 1998, the law has allowed no exceptions - even if a woman is raped, her life is at risk or the foetus is severely deformed. More than 200 women were reported to the police between 2000 and 2011, of whom 129 were prosecuted and 49 convicted - 26 for murder (with sentences of 12 to 35 years) and 23 for abortion, according to research by Citizens' Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion. Seven more have been convicted since 2012. The study underlines that these women are overwhelmingly poor, unmarried and poorly educated - and they are usually denounced by public hospital staff. Not a single criminal case originated from the private health sector where thousands of abortions are believed to take place annually. Munoz has worked with 29 of the incarcerated women, helping secure the early release of eight. "Only one intentionally induced an abortion, the other 28 suffered natural obstetric complications but were jailed for murder without any direct evidence," he says. Last year when Maria Teresa Rivera suffered a miscarriage, she was sentenced to 40 years in jail for aggravated murder. Like Xiomara, Teresa, 28, had no pregnancy symptoms before sudden severe pain and bleeding, and was reported to police by the public hospital where she had sought emergency help. The scientific evidence was flimsy, according to Munoz who will soon lodge an appeal, and the prosecution relied heavily on a colleague of hers, who testified that Rivera had said she "might be" pregnant a full 11 months before the miscarriage. A textile factory worker, she was the family's only breadwinner and her eight-year-old son is now living in dire poverty with his grandmother. Cristina Quintanilla's story is different. On 24 October 2004, the 18-year-old from rural San Miguel was seven months pregnant with her second child, living with her mother in the capital to be near a hospital for the birth. Her boyfriend was working in the US, but the couple were excited buying baby clothes and saving food tokens. "Around midnight I felt an immense pain, I thought I was dying," Quintanilla says. "I was banging on the bathroom door to get my mum's attention when I felt the baby drop out. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital." Her mother called the police - a typical step for Salvadorans in an emergency, who took them to hospital. Quintanilla was given an anaesthetic, and interrogated when she came round. Then she was handcuffed to the hospital bed, charged with manslaughter and transferred to a police cell. The first judge dismissed the case, but the prosecution appealed, upgrading the charge to aggravated murder. Quintanilla was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in jail, where she was vilified as a child killer. Her son Daniel, then only four, spent four years living with his great-grandmother until Munoz succeeded in having the sentence reduced to three years. "The medical reports couldn't explain why the baby died, but the prosecutor made me out to be a criminal who could have saved my baby even though I had passed out in pain," she says. "I will never understand why they did this to me, I lost four years of my life and still don't know why I lost my baby." Morena Herrera from Citizens' Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion says these cases have had a chilling effect, with many pregnant poor women who suffer miscarriages or complications during pregnancy "too afraid to seek medical help". "I would be terrified to go a public hospital as there is no benefit of doubt given to young women, we are presumed guilty and jailed," says Bessy Ramirez, 27, from San Salvador. "We cannot even rely on health staff to put their prejudices aside and treat us confidentially." The strict abortion law has other serious human rights implications. Suicide was the most common cause of death in 2011 among 10-to-19-year-old girls, half of whom were pregnant, according to Health Ministry figures. It was also the third most common cause of maternal mortality. Earlier this year, the plight of lupus sufferer Beatriz, 22, attracted international condemnation after the Supreme Court refused to authorise an abortion, even though her life was at risk and the foetus too deformed to be viable. Beatriz's health deteriorated while the court deliberated for several months. She gave birth at 27 weeks. The baby died within hours. Individual members of the current FMLN government, particularly Health Minister Maria Isabel Rodriguez, criticised the abortion law during the controversy over Beatriz's case. But the government has made no attempt to repeal or relax the law since coming to power in 2009, as it remains popular with large parts of the conservative population, who revere the Church and pro-life religious groups such as Si a la Vida (Yes to Life). The Arena Party, which is strongly allied with the Church, is favourite to win next year's General Election. But Esther Major, Amnesty International's El Salvador expert, describes the country's abortion law as "cruel and discriminatory". "Women and girls end up in prison for being unwilling, or simply tragically unable, to carry the pregnancy to term," she says. "It makes seeking hospital treatment for complications during pregnancy, including a miscarriage, a dangerous lottery. "It cannot be in the interests of society to criminalise women and girls in this way." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>The drugs derived from deadly poisons</title>
      <description>The deadliest poisons are often central to the most important medicines, as Michael Mosley explains.</description>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <title>Bank 'has room to raise UK rates'</title>

      <body>The Bank of England could raise interest rates a "fair amount" without hurting homeowners taking up the government's Help to Buy scheme, according to one of its policymakers. Ben Broadbent, who is on the committee that decides rates, was asked how rate rises would affect those new borrowers. "I think there is a fair amount they could go up before borrowers got into great difficulties," he told Sky News. But he added that a rate rise must not be allowed to "choke off" recovery. Rates would only go up if the economy was in good health - or if inflation was out of control, said Mr Broadbent. "We want to ensure that this recovery continues and is not choked off by a premature rise in interest rates," he told Sky News. Interest rates have been at a record low 0.5% since 2009. A rise in interest rates would mean an increase in mortgage payments for most homeowners, which could lead to a rise in repossessions if people were unable to afford the higher monthly payments. Under the second phase of the Help to Buy scheme, which is now in place, borrowers across the UK can put down a deposit of as little as 5% of the property price. The government provides a seven-year taxpayer guarantee to the lender covering 15% of the loan value. It is available for properties sold for up to £600,000 in the UK. There are concerns that Help to Buy may lead to another housing bubble and borrowers could get into trouble when rates do eventually rise. Mr Broadbent told Sky News that "the numbers entering this [Help to Buy] scheme are relatively low and although interest rates will, as you say, at some point start to rise, it is worth remembering quite how low a level we are starting from." Last week, the Bank's chief economist, Spencer Dale, said that economic conditions are unlikely to improve enough to merit a rise in rates next year. In a QandA on Twitter, Mr Dale said: "Rates will only rise when had sustained period of strong growth as long as no risk to stability." He was also asked how many mortgage repossessions there'll be when interest rates return to long-term average. "Don't know," he replied. "But when we raise interest rates economy should be stronger, higher employment, higher real wages." Mr Dale and Mr Broadbent are two of the nine people at the Bank who set monetary policy. In its last minutes, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it would make no change to the £375bn of monetary stimulus it is providing through its quantitative easing (QE) programme. The programme, brought in to give an extra stimulus because interest rates could barely be cut below the current 0.5%, has been criticised by some for helping the financial markets and the banks, by making money cheap, rather than the economy as a whole. </body>

      <body>Criminals who trade in child abuse images are to be targeted in a new British-American task force. Police Minister Damian Green will fly to the US later to formalise arrangements for the new body. The agency will be co-chaired by Mr Green and US Attorney General Eric Holder. Mr Green said: "Child abuse and exploitation online are not restricted by borders and our efforts to combat them should not be either." He went on: "British and American parents rightly expect us to do all we can to protect our children and that is why I want to agree to a much closer working relationship in this area. "This agreement will only strengthen our ability to crack down on this sickening crime." Mr Green will sign a memorandum of understanding between the two countries in the next few days. The Sun on Sunday reported that as part of the trip Mr Green will meet senior figures within the FBI, Homeland Security and other law enforcement agencies. Internet companies are also being called on to share information with their British counterparts. The move follows the 22 July announcement from Prime Minister David Cameron that most households would have sexually explicit material blocked by the internet provider unless they chose to opt out. Joanna Shields, UK business ambassador for Digital Industries and a former Google and Facebook executive, will be the industry lead for the project. She told the Sun on Sunday: "The US-UK Taskforce will play a critical role in taking forward the Prime Minister's commitment to eradicating exploitative material from the internet and keeping our children safe online. "I strongly believe that industry and government can successfully tackle this problem together. "I look forward to working with the brightest minds in the industry to develop truly innovative and creative technical solutions that will help protect the most vulnerable in our society." </body>

      <title>Salmond: 'Scotland's time is now'</title>
      <description>SNP leader Alex Salmond tells his party conference it is "time for independence" and that the case for voting yes will be made on 26 November.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-24588724</url>

      <body>SNP leader Alex Salmond told his party's conference that it was Scotland's time to be independent. During his speech to delegates gathered in Perth, he also announced that the detailed case for independence would be published on 26 November. The long-waited white paper will come ahead of the referendum itself, on 18 September next year. Mr Salmond said: "We are Scotland's independence generation and our time is now." Scotland's first minister reckoned devolution had provided a "taste of independence", but the country was now ready to make its own decisions. Mr Salmond also told the 1,000 people gathered that, under independence the national minimum wage would rise at least with the level of inflation, to help people keep pace with the cost of living. And he urged bosses at the Grangemouth petrochemical refinery, which has been temporarily shut down due to a dispute with workers to "fire up the plant". At the same time he urged union officials to drop their threat of strike action. The SNP leader said the white paper would have two functions, the first being to set out what would happen between achieving a "yes" vote in the referendum and the first elections to an independent Scottish Parliament, in the spring of 2016. He went on: "It will therefore be clear that independence is not, at its heart, about this party or this administration or this first minister but about the fundamental democratic choice for Scotland - the people's right to choose a government of their own. "Secondly, the white paper will set out our vision for Scotland - the why of independence - the Scotland that we seek. "We seek a country with a written constitution protecting not just the liberties for the people but enunciating the rights of the citizen." Mr Salmond told the conference: "We will not wake up on the morning of 19 September next year and think to ourselves what might have been. "We will wake up on that morning filled with hope and expectation - ready to build a new nation both prosperous and just. "After almost a quarter of a century moving forward to this very moment - let us ask ourselves these simple questions: If not us, then who? If not now, when? "Friends - we are Scotland's independence generation - and our time is now." Mr Salmond said of a "yes" vote in the referendum: "It will be, above all, an act of national self confidence and national self belief. "We, the people of Scotland, have by far the greatest stake in its success." Mr Salmond said the devolved Scottish Parliament, established in 1999, had been used to enact policies, like the public smoking ban, free personal care for the elderly and a council tax freeze. He went on: "With just a taste of independence, we've been able to deliver fairer policies than elsewhere in these islands. "With a measure of independence on health, on education, on law and order we've sought to make Scotland a better place. "So, let's consider what we can achieve by extending our power over the things we don't currently control. "Our welfare system, our economy, our energy supplies, our international security. "Because there is no doubt that we are paying a heavy price for Westminster decisions." The first minister said Scotland had to move away from Westminster government decisions, which he said people north of the border did not want, from housing benefit welfare reforms - branded the welfare tax by critics - to Trident nuclear weapons on the Clyde. Mr Salmond said the national minimum wage, which was brought in by the UK Labour government and which benefits about 70,000 people in Scotland, had failed to increase in real terms in almost 10 years. The first minister said a fair work commission, established under independence by an SNP government, would be to set a minimum wage guarantee. He said: "This guarantee will ensure that the minimum wage rises at the very least in line with inflation. "Let us pledge that never gain will the wages of the lowest paid in Scotland fail to keep up with the cost of living." At the same time, Mr Salmond again challenged David Cameron to face him in a referendum TV debate - an invitation the Prime Minister declined after arguing the event should be between the leaders of the campaigns for and against independence. The SNP leader said: "Here's the deal prime minister - we'll publish the white paper then you and I must debate, prime minister to first minister. "The choice is yours - step up to the plate or step out of the debate." Turning to the Grangemouth dispute, Mr Salmond said it was time for an injection of "common sense" into the bitter row between its operator Ineos and the Unite union. Ineos says the site is losing £10m a month and will close by 2017 unless workers agree to a rescue package which includes a change in their terms and conditions and final salary pension scheme. Mr Salmond left the conference on Thursday to facilitate talks between the two sides, but no agreement has been reached, and the petrochemical plant remains closed. The first minister said the threat to Grangemouth grew the longer it was shut, saying: "To the union - drop any strike threat. To the management - fire up the plant and then negotiate against the background of a working facility, not one which is in mortal danger. Find common ground. "Let us be quite clear - Scotland wants to see Grangemouth operating and the people of Grangemouth working - fire up the plant and do it now." </body>

      <title>Warning children about online porn</title>
      <description>Can schools keep pupils safe and innocent?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24476860</url>
      <date>1382228158</date>

      <body>Concerns about children's exposure to graphic sexual images online have led to calls for primary pupils to hear about the dangers of pornography. So how should schools broach the subject and what is the right age to start? At Castledyke Primary in Barton, North Lincolnshire, head teacher Rosie Pugh has adopted a robust approach to building children's resilience to any explicit material they may see online and is in no doubt that it needs to start early. She fears there are children vulnerable to abuse among her pupils and describes some of the stories she has heard from families as "eye-popping". Her views echo fears voiced by Ofsted earlier this year in a report which found that a lack of quality age appropriate sex and relationships education in more than a third of schools risks leaving children vulnerable to inappropriate sexual behaviours and sexual exploitation. The BBC sat in on a session for seven- to nine-year-olds at Castledyke run by Lynnette Smith, who teaches sex education and trains teachers in the subject in North Lincolnshire and East Yorkshire. Her approach is cheerful, direct and accompanied by hand-drawn illustrations that look as if they might have been done by an off-duty artist from The Beano. Each picture presents a scenario to which the children are asked to give a thumbs up or thumbs down. Lynnette uses the same set of cards for presentations from four-year-olds in their first year of the infants, to 10 and 11-year-olds about to leave for secondary school. The children find it hilarious. There are gales of laughter, coupled with appalled cries of disgust, but the half-hour sessions, which involve the whole class of up to 30 children, their teacher and a learning assistant, tackle some serious issues. Classes like this may not be suitable for all primaries cautions Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT): "Innocence is precious. You don't want to start too young." "My bottom line is to ask, 'From what age are they vulnerable?'" says Ms Smith. "Our first card is a girl with no clothes on. She looks as if she is ready for the bath. Well I hope she is not going to school". Lynnette asks the children to list the body parts that they should not let people touch. "Your widger and your lucy," is the response. She encourages the class to use "scientific" names instead of colloquialisms. The class chorus words like genitals, penis and vagina. There is a point to this. Knowledge and understanding can help keep a child safe, says Lynnette. "Paedophiles will avoid an educated child." The cards tackle different forms of good and bad touching. A kiss with a smile, a boy giving another boy a flower. A thumbs up to all of this. Then, grabbing a woman's breasts, looking under toilet doors when someone is inside, pulling at a boy's underwear. Thumbs down to this, declare the class. The cards tackle subtleties like where it is OK to urinate, expose your genitals or underwear or indeed to "have a little rummage in your underwear" - not outside, in broad daylight, but somewhere private like the bathroom. What sort of photographs are OK? Smiling at the camera with all your clothes on gets a thumbs up. Showing your bottom to the camera, a thumbs down. "He could put it on the internet!" says a boy. "It's a private part of the body. Nobody should ever take pictures of the private parts of your body except perhaps if you get injured and have to go to hospital," explains Lynnette. The next card depicts an older boy apparently showing a younger child an unsuitable image he has downloaded on to a smartphone. "Wrong, wrong, wrong", yells one boy. "No-one should make you watch something like that. You must tell someone," says Lynnette. Each child is asked to think of someone at home and someone at school they would tell. The picture after that is the view from behind a sofa where two adults are watching a porn film. "There are films where the actors have no clothes on or are hurting each other that some grown-ups want to look at but it's not meant for children," says Lynette. "If this is grown-ups watching and you are not there then that's fine but not if it's your babysitter or older children." There are hints that some members of the class are already aware of this sort of film: "My brother looks at pictures like this. He's 20," one child says. When Lynette asks if the child is forced to look at the pictures, he says no. Lynnette says the attitude of most children and young people is the same as it ever was. "Most are the same naive little kids who just want to know more about their bodies and are totally appalled and repelled by the idea of sex. "There are still a lot like that even at 14. "But because I have been in sex education since the mid-90s, I have seen how it's progressing. In 2002 everyone got the internet and much younger children began to see pornography. "Ten- and 11-year-olds are often keen to tell you what they have seen." Sometimes, she says, this kind of exposure can lead to sexually inappropriate behaviour and make children vulnerable to sexual exploitation. At the very least, children are asking questions about sexual issues at a much earlier age, particularly if they have seen something online or in the media that they do not understand. Sex and relationship education, she argues, is in urgent need of updating as the current guidelines do not mention issues such as sexting (the sending of sexually explicit material via a mobile phone) or pornography. In her presentation to parents before the sessions with children, she explains how vital it is to talk to children about these issues in the early years of primary school. Ideally the parents should feel confident to answer their child's questions. "If you're not sure of an answer, research it, maybe together in a book," she advises. "Don't ever say, 'Ask me when you're older,' because that's like saying, 'Go and Google it.' "If they know that they can talk to you now they will keeping coming back to you for information into their teenage years. "Most parents get it about right until children are about five and then they get the jitters." Some of the mothers said they had been horrified when they first read the school's letter about Lynette's visit but were reassured by her explanations. "I thought, no they're only seven. My husband said thank heavens he was away," said one. "It was never like this when I was at school. You find sex on television even at seven in the evening. I don't know how to address it really but you have to talk about it," said another. Ofsted's report said some schools left children vulnerable to abuse because they did not teach them appropriate language or develop the confidence to describe unwanted behaviours. It also said sex education in some primary pupils left pupils "ill-prepared" for puberty. The NAHT has called for "conversations" about online dangers to start early in primary school but Mr Hobby says these should be "general warnings that they may see things they don't like online and advice on what to do about it when they do". With schools needing to walk a line between protecting children from harm and maintaining their innocence, Mr Hobby says: "It needs a decision for each primary school in full consultation with parents." For Castledyke's head teacher, encouraging parents and teachers to talk about the issue with children is key to helping protect youngsters in vulnerable families from becoming victims of abuse. "I am always really surprised about how coy some adults are, but once it's in the open it's quite simple. You just need to speak to children openly, honestly and confidently", says Ms Pugh. "We've got to stop it happening to another generation." </body>

      <title>Titanic honour for reluctant hero</title>
      <description>Reluctant hero who picked up an infamous distress call</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-24476961</url>

      <body>Harold Cottam, the young telegraphist who picked up the Titanic's distress call, has been honoured with a plaque in the Nottinghamshire village where he died. His role is rarely featured in popular accounts of the disaster, but many believe he deserves greater recognition. It was after midnight on 15 April 1912, and 21-year-old Harold Cottam was preparing to turn in for the night. His duties as wireless operator aboard the passenger liner RMS Carpathia had finished for the day and he was using the transmitter to "take some general news" from Marconi's wireless station at Cape Cod. While doing this, he picked up a batch of messages intended for the Titanic and, having heard the famous ship's own telegraphist had been overworked, he took them down and made contact. It was a fateful decision. The reply came through, tapped out in Morse code: "We have struck ice, come at once." Speaking to the BBC in 1956, Cottam said he initially queried the message from Jack Phillips - the Titanic's wireless operator. "I said 'was it serious?' and [Phillips] said 'Yes it's a CQD [radio distress signal] old man. Here's the position, report it, and get here as soon as you can'." He took the co-ordinates and rushed to the bridge where he spoke to the senior officer on watch. But - possibly because wireless was a new technology and the Titanic was reputedly unsinkable - the Carpathia crew on duty were sceptical. "The information didn't seem as though it had sunk in as fast as I thought it ought to," said Cottam. "So I rushed down the ladder and knocked on the captain's cabin and as I saw a light I rushed in." "He said 'Who the hell?' Or words to that effect. So I said 'Well, the Titanic's struck ice, sir, and she's in distress. I've got the position here'. "So he said 'Well, give it to me', and he put a dressing gown on and went." Cottom said the Carpathia was about four hours away from the Titanic, her Captain, Arthur Rostron, having taken a number of measures to increase her speed. In the meantime, the crew were ordered to prepare food, blankets and medical care for any survivors. Cottam's account of what happened next appeared in the New York Times on 19 April, 1912. "We steamed with every ounce of speed in us in the direction given by the Titanic, and we reached the spot just before dawn. "All this time we were hearing the Titanic, sending her wireless out over the sea in a last call for help. "'We are sinking fast', was one which I picked up being sent to the [RMS] Olympic." The last message Cottam received from Jack Phillips was: "Come quick our engine room is flooded up to the boilers." After that he did not hear anything more and was sure this meant the great ship had sunk. Phillips himself perished along with more than 1,500 others, after the Titanic went down. At the scene of the disaster, Cottam described seeing wood and debris floating in the water but said he saw no bodies. He later watched as some of the 705 traumatised passengers, mostly women and children, were taken aboard. The Carpathia remained at the scene for about three hours looking for further people in the water, then set off for New York with the survivors. Other ships which received the distress call would not have arrived until hours later. The ship's crew, including Cottam, were later given medals for their part in the rescue, with Captain Rostron receiving both a knighthood and the Congressional gold medal. But the crucial part played by the wireless operator later slipped into relative obscurity - except among Titanic enthusiasts. Cottam's family said his modesty and desire for privacy probably had much to do with that. Later he would turn down a chance to play himself in A Night to Remember, the 1958 film about the Titanic's sinking. However, they also believe the significance of his actions is little understood - arguably, the Titanic's survivors would have spent many more hours exposed to the elements had he not decided to make contact that night. Harold Cottam died in Lowdham in 1984, aged 93. Some of his elderly neighbours knew of his achievement but as time went by others simply saw him as a quiet and private man. The blue plaque was unveiled by Cottam's granddaughter Wendy Gell at the Ship Inn in Lowdham on Saturday. His great-granddaughter Nichola Gell said: "He never spoke about [the Titanic]. He didn't want fame and fortune. "That was the man he was. But if he hadn't done what he did more people would have died. "It's nice that something is finally happening and he's got some recognition, whether he likes it or not!" </body>

      <body>He made his name as an insufferable spin doctor in political satire The Thick of It and a plain-speaking manager in the BBC's Twenty Twelve. Now actor Vincent Franklin is on stage portraying one of Britain's greatest film stars, Charles Laughton. The legend of Charles Laughton has faded in the 50 years since his death, but the actor was among Britain's first Hollywood superstars, a giant of the silver screen from the 1930s onwards. Whether playing Henry VIII - a role that won him an Oscar in 1934 - or Rembrandt, Captain Bligh or Quasimodo, he was regarded by many as the greatest character actor of his age. "I certainly felt very excited about the idea of playing Laughton when I was asked to do it," explains Vincent Franklin. "Then within a week of being asked, when I'd started to read some books, I thought, this is the most arrogant thing I've ever agreed to do. "If somebody said to an actor, 'Do you want to play Laurence Olivier? Do you want to play Gielgud? Do you want to play De Niro?' you'd go, 'No I'm not going to play De Niro. Unless you're as good as De Niro how can you possibly play De Niro?' "But somehow I'd foolishly gone, 'Yeah, I'll play Charles Laughton.'" Laughton was born in the Yorkshire seaside resort of Scarborough and it is in the actor's home town that Franklin is bringing the Laughton legend back to life. A private and insecure person, Laughton never gave interviews. In the play, Franklin attempts to peel back the screen persona to reveal the real man. "He was an extraordinary lost soul," Franklin says. "As a fat, bald, northern actor myself, the idea that you can be an actor is fine. "But the idea that a man who is by his own [admission] an ugly man can become a film star is quite extraordinary. "On the surface of it, he's an extraordinary, successful human being. But on the inside it's a man who struggled with his own religious beliefs, struggled with his sexuality and struggled with self-loathing while at the same time being a true artist." The play, titled Laughton, is at Scarborough's Stephen Joseph Theatre, which was run by Alan Ayckbourn for 37 years. On display in the foyer is a photograph of Laughton, the guest of honour when the building was opened as a cinema in 1936. Franklin, from Bradford, was most recently seen playing Labour whip Michael Cocks in the National Theatre's 1970s political drama This House. But he is most recognisable from his TV roles as the no-nonsense head of contracts Nick Jowett in Olympic spoof Twenty Twelve and the all-nonsense Conservative PR guru Stewart Pearson in The Thick of It. The insufferably smug Pearson likes nothing better than to "imagineer the narrative" or "take a few turns on the ideas carousel". The Thick of It looks to be on indefinite recess now that Peter Capaldi, who played Pearson's expletive-slinging nemesis Malcolm Tucker, has been cast as Doctor Who. Writer Armando Iannucci recently said the show "has quietly been put in its box". "There's room for some specials," Franklin believes. "Whether Malcolm Tucker will be able to come back from Alpha Centauri or wherever he's been taken in the Tardis I don't know, but I hope so. "I regularly meet some people from it and there is a real sense of, 'It would be nice to do one more, wouldn't it?'" Unusually for an actor, Franklin also has a real job - a decade ago, he founded a company called Quietroom, which advises companies and government departments on how to communicate clearly. In that capacity, he is the anti-Stewart Pearson. "We improvise quite a lot of The Thick of It and quite a lot of what I do is the exact opposite of what I would tell someone to do [at Quietroom]," he says. For someone who advises people how to communicate, Franklin is suitably conscious of his choice of words as an interviewee. At one point he warns, "I'm just going to ramble for a moment now" and regularly checks: "Does that make sense?" When Quietroom works for the government, there are some startled reactions when Franklin pops up in Whitehall between acting jobs, he says. "Between the last government and this one, I went in to do an audit of the language the Treasury was using in things like the Budget and their website," the actor says. "I had my Stewart Pearson beard on - because that's my beard - and I do get very strange looks from people walking around the Treasury or HMRC [Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs] from people going, 'Satan lives!' "What's great about this show is that its biggest fans are people who work in government. Real MPs do want to come and have their picture taken with you, which always seems really bizarre to me." Back in Scarborough, Franklin praises Laughton's writer, the author and geologist Roger Osborne, for his use of language. "So much of what we do in life is about reading stuff and understanding what lies behind it," he says. "Does that make sense? Whether that's us buying an insurance project or playing Charles Laughton. So choosing the right words is really important." Laughton is at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough until 26 October. </body>

      <body>Having climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, explored China, Jordan and trekked around Madagascar, it was an accident which left Sue Wright with a 5% chance of survival and a leg amputation that saw her horizons rapidly shrink. But five years on she is close to completing her scuba-diving qualifications giving her a new underwater world to explore. Miss Wright, 52, from Ickenham, west London, suffered life-threatening head, organ and leg injuries in March 2008 when a van driver mounted the pavement she was walking on. She said: "I suffered a brain injury because my head hit the van with full force and it caused my brain to bleed. My left leg was later amputated above the knee and the other leg was very badly smashed up from the calf down and several times during my stay in hospital I was close to death. "I'm not anywhere near recovery but earlier this year decided I've got to get out and do things because if I can swim and explore I'm not missing out." After doing some research she found her local Sub-Aqua Club in Eastcote and signed up but found there were challenges to overcome before she even got in the water. "People are scared anyway about breathing underwater without all the injuries and once you've faced a near-death experience it makes you very cautious because you know life can be over in a breath. "The first day I went it was snowing and I'd only just started walking on my prosthetic leg. "I had to take my leg off and get to the side of the pool on my bottom and it was so embarrassing because people sometimes don't know how to react so you see disgust or pity, but they were lovely and really understanding." Miss Wright was paired up with instructor Nigel Ealand who said that in more than 20 years he had never taught anyone with a disability and told Sue "between the two of us we'll have to figure it out". The biggest and most pressing problem they had to work on was Miss Wright's balance. She said: "With the leg missing I felt I was going to flop over and there was a motion missing when I kicked and I had to get used to that." The solution, it turned out, was to add weight to her body, but not where you might think. Mr Ealand said: "One side of her body is a lot lighter and so she tended to end upside-down in the water so you'd think you'd put the weights on the side of the missing leg, but it didn't work and we have discovered it needs to be on the other side. "There were also difficulties when we taught mask cleaning in the shallows. The normal thing would be to kneel on the bottom, but Sue can't do that so in the end we got her to lie down and prop herself up using her elbows. "You've really got to throw the whole rulebook away." Sue has so far completed the theory and pool sessions for the BSAC (British Sub-Aqua Club) Ocean Diver course and just needs to undertake an open water dive which she plans to do next year when the water is warmer. Mr Ealand said: "She's been getting stronger. If she'd been in a wheelchair she would have had a strong upper body but as she uses the prosthetic leg she's weak all the way through, so over the next few months we'll build up her strength. "She is an incredibly strong and determined woman and even when she has found certain things a challenge, she has never been even close to giving up and I'm really excited about the open-water dive." From there Miss Wright hopes her diving world will expand to the Red Sea and Belize but her hunger for adventure does not stop with diving. Next year she will sail along Drake passage from Argentina to Antarctica and back on the Lord Nelson tall ship as part of the Jubilee Sailing Trust programme which fits ships for disabled people. She added: "There are problems I've got to conquer, but there are always ways of doing it." </body>

      <body>After a week in which energy price increases have again caused widespread anger, there is a collective call for urgent action in the newspapers. The Mail on Sunday, which leads on the Archbishop of Canterbury's intervention, asks why the energy companies have to raise their prices so much, so fast. The Sunday Express says prices are now so high that even families on decent incomes cannot keep their houses properly heated and it is time that MPs did something about this state of affairs. For the Observer, never-ending tariff increases are unsustainable,. "How long can privatisation, along with light-touch regulation, remain the business model for the electricity and gas industries," it asks. In the Sunday Mirror's view, most of the windfall from the increases is not funding investment or meeting higher costs - it is adding to profits that go straight into the pockets of bosses and shareholders. Meanwhile, the Sunday Telegraph reports that senior Tories are drawing up a secret plan to cut green taxes as part of an overhaul of the industry designed to bring down customers' bills. According to the paper, the Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary, Ed Davey, is said to be furious. The fall out from the "plebgate" row involving former Conservative Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell and police in Downing Street continues to generate headlines. In the words of Tony Parsons in the Sun on Sunday, the police have had a rotten week. Nick Ferrari, writing in the Sunday Express, agrees and says the accusation that three officers tried to discredit Mr Mitchell drives another sizeable nail into the coffin of public trust in the police. For Adam Boulton, in the Sunday Times, Mr Mitchell's fight to clear his name is now about much more than one man's thwarted ambitions. In the Observer, Henry Porter calls for a royal commission to look into the structure of the police, training, ethical standards and investigation of wrongdoing. Nick Clegg's attack on free schools is widely reported - and makes the lead for the Observer and the Independent on Sunday. The Observer says the coalition has "descended into open warfare" over a key domestic policy. The Independent says the deputy prime minister's views aligns the Liberal Democrats more closely with Labour on education. For its main story, the Sunday Express reports that a jab giving life-long protection against all flu strains could be ready within five years. It says scientists in the UK and Europe have had positive results in the first human trials of a universal vaccine that works even if the virus mutates. There is unease in some quarters over the chancellor's invitation to China to invest in the next generation of Britain's nuclear power stations. Will Hutton, in the Observer, says this a breathtaking step in an industry where the sensitivities over operating safety, technical efficiency and waste disposal are so acute. In the view of Camilla Cavendish in the Sunday Times, it is a tragedy that having pioneered nuclear technology, UK scientists and engineers will not be building these new plants to a British design. Finally, the euphoria that greeted England's qualification for the World Cup in Brazil has been tempered for some by the inevitable consequence that the England Band will again be out in full musical force, says the Observer. It says the band are facing a cacophony of calls on Twitter to lay their instruments aside. Comedian, David Baddiel - writer of the lyrics to the Three Lions football song - added his voice to the campaign by commenting: "I tire of endless Rule Britannia and Great Escapes". </body>
