      <title>Salmond: 'Scotland's time is now'</title>

      <body>SNP leader Alex Salmond told his party's conference that it was Scotland's time to be independent. During his speech to delegates gathered in Perth, he also announced that the detailed case for independence would be published on 26 November. The long-waited white paper will come ahead of the referendum itself, on 18 September next year. Mr Salmond said: "We are Scotland's independence generation and our time is now." Scotland's first minister reckoned devolution had provided a "taste of independence", but the country was now ready to make its own decisions. Mr Salmond also told the 1,000 people gathered that, under independence the national minimum wage would rise at least with the level of inflation, to help people keep pace with the cost of living. And he urged bosses at the Grangemouth petrochemical refinery, which has been temporarily shut down due to a dispute with workers to "fire up the plant". At the same time he urged union officials to drop their threat of strike action. The SNP leader said the white paper would have two functions, the first being to set out what would happen between achieving a "yes" vote in the referendum and the first elections to an independent Scottish Parliament, in the spring of 2016. He went on: "It will therefore be clear that independence is not, at its heart, about this party or this administration or this first minister but about the fundamental democratic choice for Scotland - the people's right to choose a government of their own. "Secondly, the white paper will set out our vision for Scotland - the why of independence - the Scotland that we seek. "We seek a country with a written constitution protecting not just the liberties for the people but enunciating the rights of the citizen." Mr Salmond told the conference: "We will not wake up on the morning of 19 September next year and think to ourselves what might have been. "We will wake up on that morning filled with hope and expectation - ready to build a new nation both prosperous and just. "After almost a quarter of a century moving forward to this very moment - let us ask ourselves these simple questions: If not us, then who? If not now, when? "Friends - we are Scotland's independence generation - and our time is now." Mr Salmond said of a "yes" vote in the referendum: "It will be, above all, an act of national self confidence and national self belief. "We, the people of Scotland, have by far the greatest stake in its success." Mr Salmond said the devolved Scottish Parliament, established in 1999, had been used to enact policies, like the public smoking ban, free personal care for the elderly and a council tax freeze. He went on: "With just a taste of independence, we've been able to deliver fairer policies than elsewhere in these islands. "With a measure of independence on health, on education, on law and order we've sought to make Scotland a better place. "So, let's consider what we can achieve by extending our power over the things we don't currently control. "Our welfare system, our economy, our energy supplies, our international security. "Because there is no doubt that we are paying a heavy price for Westminster decisions." The first minister said Scotland had to move away from Westminster government decisions, which he said people north of the border did not want, from housing benefit welfare reforms - branded the welfare tax by critics - to Trident nuclear weapons on the Clyde. Mr Salmond said the national minimum wage, which was brought in by the UK Labour government and which benefits about 70,000 people in Scotland, had failed to increase in real terms in almost 10 years. The first minister said a fair work commission, established under independence by an SNP government, would be to set a minimum wage guarantee. He said: "This guarantee will ensure that the minimum wage rises at the very least in line with inflation. "Let us pledge that never gain will the wages of the lowest paid in Scotland fail to keep up with the cost of living." At the same time, Mr Salmond again challenged David Cameron to face him in a referendum TV debate - an invitation the Prime Minister declined after arguing the event should be between the leaders of the campaigns for and against independence. The SNP leader said: "Here's the deal prime minister - we'll publish the white paper then you and I must debate, prime minister to first minister. "The choice is yours - step up to the plate or step out of the debate." Turning to the Grangemouth dispute, Mr Salmond said it was time for an injection of "common sense" into the bitter row between its operator Ineos and the Unite union. Ineos says the site is losing £10m a month and will close by 2017 unless workers agree to a rescue package which includes a change in their terms and conditions and final salary pension scheme. Mr Salmond left the conference on Thursday to facilitate talks between the two sides, but no agreement has been reached, and the petrochemical plant remains closed. The first minister said the threat to Grangemouth grew the longer it was shut, saying: "To the union - drop any strike threat. To the management - fire up the plant and then negotiate against the background of a working facility, not one which is in mortal danger. Find common ground. "Let us be quite clear - Scotland wants to see Grangemouth operating and the people of Grangemouth working - fire up the plant and do it now." </body>

      <title>Two held over Manchester sex attacks</title>
      <description>A boy of 14 and an 18-year-old man are arrested by police investigating three sexual assaults near the University of Manchester.</description>

      <body>A boy of 14 and an 18-year-old man have been arrested by police investigating three sexual assaults near the University of Manchester. Police had earlier released an e-fit if a boy, who they said could have been as young as 12, who they believed may have carried out the attacks. The police said they would continue to investigate the "appalling incidents" to establish who is responsible. Two of the assaults occurred on 21 September and the third on 5 October. In the first incident, a 27-year-old was approached from behind and grabbed in Lloyd Street North at 18:15 BST. The woman screamed and the offender, who was described as being in his mid-teens and mixed race, threatened her. He grabbed her again before running away. The next incident followed minutes later in Oxford Road when a 21-year-old woman was approached by a boy who made lewd comments as she left John Rylands library. She carried on walking on Moss Lane East and was sexually assaulted by her assailant. The third attack took place at the Manchester Science Park in Lloyd Street North at about 14:15 BST on 5 October. A 32-year-old woman was using her mobile phone when she was approached by two young boys. She was sexually assaulted by one of the boys, who was described as being slim, Asian, wearing baggy trousers and carrying a rucksack, and aged about 12 or 13 years old. She pushed him away but he sexually assaulted her again before running off towards Pencroft Way with the second young boy, who was also described as being Asian. Det Ch Insp Colin Larkin said: "These crimes have shocked everyone and I am pleased to say that we have now made two arrests. "I would like to thank members of the public and the media for their support and the information they have provided and as a result, we are now in a position where two people are in custody and are being questioned. "However, we still remain in the early days of this investigation and there is still a lot of work to be done. I want to reassure the community that, whilst we have made arrests, we will continue to investigate these appalling incidents so we so can establish all the facts and who is responsible." He added that he would like anyone who has any more information about the three attacks or any other incidents to come forward. </body>

      <title>Dyke defends FA commission make-up</title>
      <description>Football Association chairman Greg Dyke responds to criticism of the make-up of his England commission.</description>

      <body>Football Association chairman Greg Dyke responded to criticism of his commission to improve the England team by stressing he is still keen to recruit black and ethnic members. Heather Rabbatts, the FA's only female board member, criticised the group's all-white, all-male make-up. Dyke admitted making a "mistake" in announcing only part of the line-up. But he added: "To suggest we never considered the ethnic balance of the commission is unfair." Jamaica-born Rabbatts, 57, wrote a letter to Dyke and fellow board members to complain about "a lack of diversity", saying she had no choice but to go public as there had been a "refusal to understand" her position in private. Rabbatts said: "The opportunity to lead an informed debate on the future of English players has been singularly damaged." In an open letter in response, Dyke said he was "sorry" Rabbatts felt the need to go public and "surprised" at the comments of his former board colleague at the BBC, where he was director-general from 2000 to 2004. Dyke wrote: "The make-up of the commission has been moving for some time, but I did explain to you and the board that we planned to appoint two or three additional members and would have done so this week had the issue of Roy Hodgson's dressing-room comments not blown up." The eight names announced for the commission are Dyke, FA vice-chairman Roger Burden, former England manager Glenn Hoddle, ex-England defender Danny Mills, League Managers' Association chairman Howard Wilkinson, Professional Footballers' Association chairman Ritchie Humphreys, Football League chairman Greg Clarke, and Crewe director of football Dario Gradi. The group will consider how to increase the number of England-qualified players appearing for the country's top clubs. In September, Dyke set England targets of reaching the Euro 2020 semi-finals and winning the World Cup in 2022. Dyke added in his letter that he had attempted to bring ethnic minority representation on to the FA commission by including Clarke Carlisle, the former chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association. He wrote: "We originally had Clarke Carlisle as a member, but the PFA decided they would rather have their new chairman [Humphreys] on the commission. We also identified other individuals from the BAME [Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic] community, who we felt would add strength and value to the commission. "Unfortunately, as they are active in football on a day-to-day basis, they felt the time commitments would be prohibitive. "As you know, we still want to see people with relevant experience from the BAME community on the commission and giving evidence to it." The new sports minister Helen Grant, who is also equalities minister, says she will speak to the FA next week to express her concerns about the commission. "Sports governing bodies must reflect the make-up of the diverse society that we live in," she said. "I expect the FA to ensure that voices from all backgrounds are heard loud and clear and contribute to this important piece of work to help strengthen English football. I will discuss the issue with the FA next week." Piara Powar, executive director of European anti-racism body Fare and a member of Fifa's new anti-racism taskforce, said: "Heather Rabbatts is the first woman and only ethnic minority on the FA Board. She has ideas, experience and nous. But seems to have been ignored. Why?" Lord Ouseley, chairman of anti-racism campaigning group Kick It Out, said he had raised the issue of the commission with Dyke, and questioned why he had not used Rabbatts' contacts and experience to bring on a suitable representative. "This has been a disaster for the FA in public relations terms. Heather must have been at her wits' end to go public like this," he said. "I find it very surprising therefore that someone as close to the chairman as Heather Rabbatts, with all her experience and contacts, was not asked for her advice on ensuring diversity." </body>

      <title>Girl's discovery gives family 'hope'</title>
      <description>The family of a Sheffield boy who went missing in Greece in 1991 say the discovery of a girl living in a Roma camp in the country gives them "great hope".</description>

      <body>The discovery of a girl found living on a Roma settlement in Greece has given the family of a missing Sheffield boy "great hope", his sister has said. Ben Needham, from Sheffield, was 21 months old when he went missing while on a family holiday in Kos in 1991. Ben's sister, Leighanna, said the girl's discovery, in a camp near Farsala, central Greece, was "very significant to Ben's case". "It gives us great hope that one day this will be Ben," she said. DNA tests revealed the child, called Maria and aged about four, was not related to the couple she lived with. Officials believe she may have been a victim of abduction or child trafficking. Ms Needham said this case was very similar to her family's and the Greek police's original thoughts about what had happened to Ben. "Child trafficking and illegal adoption in Greece has been pretty high and that's exactly what they thought had happened to Ben - that he was taken for a childless family and passed through Gypsy camps." A spokesman for Kate and Gerry McCann, whose daughter Madeleine went missing in Portugal in 2007, said the case also gave them hope that she would one day be found alive. In October last year, police began a major new search for Ben's remains near the family's former farmhouse on Kos but nothing was found. His mother has always maintained her son is alive and was probably abducted. The Needham family was "delighted" at the discovery of the girl and hoped she could soon be reunited with her parents, said Ms Needham. "Hopefully, this will allow the Greek authorities to trace what happened to Ben. "It's now nearly Ben's 24th birthday and it's too, too long," she said. </body>

      <body>At least 10 people have been killed after a small tourist plane crashed near the city of Namur in south-east Belgium. It was carrying a group of skydivers and crashed shortly after take-off, killing all those on board, the local mayor has told the AFP news agency. The plane is thought to have taken off from the Temploux aerodrome and crashed around 10 minutes later in a field. Its wing appeared to have suffered some damage, Belgian media report. The small plane came down near the village of Marchovelette, 10km (six miles) from Namur. The passengers did not have time to jump out, the mayor of the nearby town of Fernelmont told AFP. Pictures show black smoke billowing from a burnt-out fuselage. "I just saw a plane lose its right wing in mid-flight and crash. I heard a massive 'bang' towards the south of Marchovelette," one witness told Belgian television. "I didn't see anyone escape with a parachute," the witness added. </body>

      <title>Titanic violin sold for £900,000</title>
      <description>The violin that was apparently played to calm the Titanic's passengers is sold for £900,000 at auction in Wiltshire - the highest price ever paid for memorabilia from the famous liner.</description>

      <body>The violin that was apparently played to calm passengers on the Titanic as it sank was sold for £900,000 in just 10 minutes at auction in Wiltshire. It was played by band leader Wallace Hartley, who died along with 1,517 others as the ship went down. It had a guide price of £300,000. The BBC's Duncan Kennedy said the buyer was believed to be British. Auctioneer Alan Aldridge said the violin was the "rarest and most iconic" piece of Titanic memorabilia. Many of the other items up for sale, such as photographs, newspapers and crockery, were sold for between £10 and a few hundred pounds. Mr Aldridge set the bidding at £50 for the violin, which was lot 230 of 251, so "two of his friends could bid" - but after just a couple of minutes it had passed £100,000. It eventually sold for £900,000 after fierce bidding between two telephone bidders. Hartley has become part of the ship's legend after leading his fellow musicians in playing as the vessel sank. They are famously said to have played the hymn Nearer My God To Thee. It had taken seven years for the Devizes auction house, Henry Aldridge and Son, to authenticate the instrument. Several experts were used, including forensic scientists who said the wood still contained salt deposits from the sea water. Some people still doubt whether the violin is the genuine article, however, and believe it could not have survived being submerged in the sea. But it is claimed the violin survived in a leather case strapped to Mr Harley's body who was found wearing his cork and linen lifejacket. A diary entry by his fiancee, Maria Robinson, said it was saved from the water and returned to her. Following her death in 1939, the violin was given to her local Salvation Army citadel and was later passed on to the current anonymous owner's mother in the early 1940s. The auction house said it had attracted interest from collectors all over the world and added that more than 315,000 people viewed it during a three-month exhibition in the United States. The most money previously paid for a piece of Titanic memorabilia is thought to have been a plan of the ship used in the 1912 inquiry into the sinking. This was bought by a private collector at auction for £220,000 in 2011. </body>

      <title>HS2 will benefit UK, says minister</title>
      <description>Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin says the HS2 project will benefit the whole UK, after figures suggested some areas would be worse off if it was built.</description>

      <body>The HS2 high-speed rail project will bring benefits to the whole UK, the transport secretary has said. Patrick McLoughlin was speaking after details of the potential losses that HS2 could cause in about 50 regional economies as calculated by consultants KPMG were revealed by BBC Newsnight. Some of the "losing" areas would benefit from other planned rail improvements, Mr McLoughlin said. He said the project "was controversial, but it was the right thing to do". Speaking to the BBC, Mr McLoughlin said he wanted to see every part of the UK benefit from HS2. "All these investments that we are looking at is to serve the people of the UK, to make the UK a place where we attract investment," he said. "It's of no doubt to me that it's beneficial to the UK. We need to make sure our cities in the north are able to compete with the rest of Europe as well. "HS2 is vitally important overall for the long-term future of the economy." The KPMG report, which was released in September, said the line could boost the UK economy by £15bn a year and listed the regions it said would benefit, with Greater London and West Midlands the biggest winners. But although it included maps showing which areas not on the route could potentially be worse off, it did not include details of the scale of possible losses. KPMG's findings have now been released in a freedom of information request passed to BBC Two's Newsnight programme. According to the research economic output would be worst affected: HS2 Ltd's chief executive has called them "unsurprising". But James Bream, policy director of Aberdeen's Chamber of Commerce, said it was "really disappointing" that such a huge number was left out of the original report. He added the negative impact for the whole north-east of Scotland could be "significant to say the least." Richard Houghton, from campaign group HS2 Action Alliance, claimed the whole project is based on "voodoo economics". He said: "If I was sitting in one of the 50 areas set to lose out to the tune of millions of pounds, I would be asking very clear questions." The chief executive of HS2 Ltd, Alison Munro, said: "What this is showing is that the places that are on the high-speed network... those are the places that will benefit most from high-speed two. "But high-speed two isn't the only investment that the government is making. Over the next five years it is planning to spend £73bn on transport infrastructure." </body>

      <title>UN calls for urgent Syria ceasefire</title>
      <description>The UN's humanitarian chief calls for an immediate ceasefire in the Damascus suburb of Moadamiyah to allow for aid delivery and evacuations.</description>

      <body>The UN's humanitarian chief has called for an "immediate pause in hostilities" in Moadamiyah, a rebel-held suburb of the Syrian capital, Damascus. Valerie Amos said 3,000 people were evacuated last Sunday, but that the same number were trapped in the town amid continuing shelling and fighting. Thousands of people were in a similar situations in towns across the country, she said. The army has previously said rebel-held areas must surrender or starve. Also on Saturday, activists said at least 16 soldiers were killed in a suicide bombing and fighting at a checkpoint near the mainly-Christian area of Jaramana. State media blamed "terrorists" for the explosion but did not give details. Rebels control much of the countryside around Damascus but Jaramana - a Christian and Druze area mostly loyal to President Bashar al-Assad - is still held by the government. In a statement, Baroness Amos said was "extremely worried by the situation unfolding across Syria where ordinary women, children and men are facing horrific violence and brutality from all sides of the conflict". She said relief workers had been unable to access Moadamiyah for months, and that the ongoing conflict was preventing any rescue mission from going ahead. "I call on all parties to agree an immediate pause in hostilities in Moadamiyah to allow humanitarian agencies unhindered access to evacuate the remaining civilians and deliver life-saving treatment and supplies in areas where fighting and shelling is ongoing," she said. But she said this was not the only area of concern, citing Nubil, Zahra, old Aleppo town, old Homs town and Hassakeh as other places where people were in danger. "Civilians must be allowed to move to safer areas without the fear of attack," she added. "It is vital that all parties to the conflict respect their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian laws to protect civilians and to allow neutral, impartial humanitarian organizations safe access to all people in need, wherever they are in Syria." Moadamiyah and at least two other Damascus's suburbs - Yarmouk and Eastern Ghouta - have been besieged by government forces for several months. The situation has become so desperate that earlier this week Muslim clerics issued a religious ruling allowing people to eat cats, dogs and donkeys just to survive. Those animals are usually considered unfit for human consumption in Islam. Syrian activists say they are now starting to record the first deaths of complications caused by malnutrition. On Friday, the US urged the Syrian government to allow relief convoys to reach starving civilians. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki warned that "those who are responsible for atrocities in the Damascus suburbs and across Syria must be identified and held accountable". More than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria's conflict, now in its third year. The unrest began in the midst of the Arab Spring regional uprisings, with protests against President Bashar Assad, before degenerating into civil war. A British surgeon who volunteered in a hospital in northern Syria for five weeks told the BBC on Friday that he had treated pregnant women deliberately targeted by snipers. David Nott said there "was definitely a game going on between the snipers". "One day we would receive patients who had purely groin wounds, another day purely chest wounds or purely abdominal wounds. Then another day full-term pregnant ladies were coming in having been shot." Most of the unborn babies and many of the women did not survive, he said. International efforts to halt the violence have consistently faltered, but last month the UN Security Council broke its deadlock, voting unanimously to adopt a binding resolution on ridding the country of chemical weapons. The move followed international outrage at a chemical weapons attack near Damascus in August. UN experts are currently working in Syria, inspecting chemical weapons sites and destroying the arsenal, and say they have completed almost half their mission. </body>

      <title>Lebanese ex-hostages home from Syria</title>
      <description>Nine Lebanese pilgrims kidnapped in Syria last year return home to Beirut, after a hostage deal sees two Turkish pilots released in Lebanon.</description>

      <body>Nine Lebanese Shia pilgrims who were kidnapped by rebels in Syria in May 2012 have arrived back in Beirut a day after being released. The group were freed in a deal brokered by Qatar. Two Turkish pilots who were being held hostage in Lebanon were also released as part of the agreement. Turkish Airlines pilots Murat Akpinar and Murat Agca were seized in Beirut in August in a retaliatory abduction. They arrived in Istanbul on a Qatari jet on Saturday evening. A third part of the complex hostage negotiations involved the release of a number of female prisoners being held by the Syrian government. It is not yet clear whether that has taken place. The BBC's Dima Hamdan, at Beirut airport, says she understands the Syrian government was in the process of releasing an estimated 130 women detainees. The Lebanese group were released by their captors on Friday evening and driven to Istanbul, from where they flew to Beirut. There were jubilant scenes at Beirut's international airport as they arrived after a year-and-a-half in captivity to greeted by friends and family, as well as politicians and religious leaders. Speaking to local media, some of the men thanked the Qatari negotiators, Turkey and the Assad government for helping to free them. The nine were among 11 people seized while making their way back to Lebanon after a tour of holy sites in Iran. Two of them escaped. They were reportedly being held in northern Syria by fighters from a Sunni-based rebel group opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Then in August, the pilots were seized from a bus close to Beirut's international airport. A group called Zuwwar al-Imam Rida said it had carried out the kidnapping, and that the men would be freed in exchange for the pilgrims. It demanded that Turkey used its influence with Syrian rebels to make the swap possible. Turkey has consistently backed Syria's Sunni rebels, while much of Lebanon's Shia community supports President Bashar al-Assad. The pilots' abduction sparked protests in Lebanon, and growing concerns that the Syrian civil war is spilling over the border. Earlier this week they appeared in a video broadcast on Lebanese television saying they were both well and wanted to go home. Then on Saturday, Turkish state media announced that they were free and returning home. They were met on arrival in Istanbul by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other officials. Syrian and Lebanese politics have been deeply intertwined throughout the history of the two states. Syria had a large military presence in Lebanon for 29 years. It finally withdrew its soldiers in 2005, but has maintained a strong influence. </body>

      <body>The badger cull in Gloucestershire could be halted after a legal challenge from a charity which says plans to extend the culling period are illegal. An eight-week extension to the cull was requested after a failure to kill the minimum number of badgers during a six-week pilot aimed at curbing bovine TB. In a letter, the Badger Trust said it would be "unlawful" for Natural England "to grant a further licence". Defra said it could not comment on the letter for "legal reasons". It said 708 badgers had been killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Nigel Gibbens, chief veterinary officer, advised the cull should be extended. Defra said culls were "important to tackle bovine TB". A Defra spokesman said: "That is why these pilot culls are so important. We have to use every tool in the box because TB is so difficult to eradicate and it is spreading rapidly." The Badger Trust said it was asking Natural England to consider their letter when looking at the application to "grant a fresh licence" to shoot badgers in Gloucestershire. The letter used quotes from original statements from ministers and officials who the trust said had talked of the cull having "a maximum period of six weeks". The trust said it believed the cull had "met its purpose in testing the 'effectiveness' and had shown it not to be effective". A licence was granted last week to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November. </body>

      <title>Roma girl 'can return to France'</title>
      <description>A Roma girl whose deportation sparked protests can return from Kosovo to finish her studies, but her family cannot, French President Hollande says.</description>

      <body>French President Francois Hollande has said a Roma girl who was removed from her school bus and deported can return to finish her studies, but that her family cannot. Leonarda Dibrani, 15, was expelled along with her parents and five siblings earlier this month after they lost their battle for asylum in France. The case has sparked protests by student groups across the country. A government investigation ruled that the deportation had been legal. But the report, released on Saturday, said any future such action against school children should be taken outside school hours. The Dibrani family had been living in Levier, in the Doubs region of eastern France. They cited discrimination in Kosovo as grounds for asylum. An order for their expulsion was issued after they lost their battle for asylum. After two postponements, it was rescheduled for October and the father, who was detained in a different town, was expelled on 8 October. Leonarda had stayed at a friend's overnight so was not at the family home when border police arrived to deport them. She was instead taken away by police in front of other students while on a field trip. The whole family were flown back to Kosovo that day. Mr Hollande told French TV: "If she makes a request, because of the circumstances, and because she wants to pursue her schooling in France, a welcome will be extended to her." But he stressed that the invitation was to Leonarda alone. The girl has said she will not return to France without her family. "I will not abandon my family. I'm not the only one who has to go to school, there are also my brothers and sisters," the AFP news agency quoted her as saying. Leonarda's father, Resat Dibrani, told reporters in Mitrovica, where the family are now living, that they would not stay in Kosovo. "I have no freedom here for myself, my children and my family. The police can say whatever they want, but for me, justice does not work in France." But he said the family would not be split up by his daughter going alone. "Either we all go together or nobody goes." Mr Dibrani had admitted this week that he had lied about the children's origins in the hope of boosting their asylum application - only he is from Kosovo but his wife and six children were all born in Italy. The mayor of the Italian town of Fano, where the family lived for several years, said they left after the authorities there threatened to take the children into care. "The children hardly ever went to school even though he had signed them up. He sent them out begging. They lived in the streets," Stefano Aguzzi told AFP. "We told him that he could not continue living here without paying for anything. We gave him a set of rules for him to be able to stay." Mr Aguzzi said that if the family returned, Fano officials would "not welcome them back with open arms" but that would "consider them like we do all the other immigrants". Hundreds of French students have staged protests against the deportation, and the manner in which Leonarda was removed, in Paris and other cities. Much of the anger has been directed at Interior Minister Manuel Valls, previously a popular figure. The BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris says Mr Valls has also faced bitter recriminations from within his own party, accused of betraying the principles of the socialist government. But the government was also warned by the right-wing opposition that if it caved into the protests and allowed the family back, it would set a dangerous precedent, says our correspondent. Mr Hollande's invitation to Leonarda is perhaps the president's best way out of damaging few days, he adds. </body>

      <title>Banks 'said Royal Mail underpriced'</title>
      <description>Two investment banks canvassed by government 'warned Royal Mail sell-off price was too cheap'.</description>

      <body>The government ignored two banks that valued Royal Mail at £5bn, far more than shares were sold for, the Financial Times has reported. The government sold 60% of the postal service last week for £3.30 per share, but they soon passed £5. The FT said at least two banks had said shares would be worth up to £5 each. The government said banks' estimates had been made long before fresh factors arose, such as strike threats and financial uncertainty in the US. The government sought opinion from investment banks bidding to manage the sale, and selected Lazard as its independent adviser, before deciding to dispose of 60% of Royal Mail at an Initial Public Offering (IPO) price of £3.3bn. Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Bank of America Merill Lynch and UBS were appointed to lead the sale. Lazard has now been called in by the Commons Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) select committee to answer questions on the pricing after shares had hit 508.3p, before closing at 502.5p. In a statement, a Department for Business, Innovation and Skills spokesman said seven of the 21 banks that pitched in May to act for the government on the sale of Royal Mail were successful. "The proposals included indicative valuations of the company based, in many instances, solely on information already in the public domain," he said. "Banks made their own assumptions of Royal Mail future performance. "The range was wide with the median around £3.6 billion taking into account IPO [initial public offering] discount. The banks appointment process was overseen by Lazard as independent advisers to government. He added: "The banks' proposals came months before any threat of strike action by the unions, financial market uncertainty in the United States and other factors which the government has already said were taken into consideration in setting a price for the company in September." Business select committee member Nadhim Zahawi said he believed the government had got its sums right. Conservative MP Mr Zahawi said he thought the government had acted wisely, given the risks of a flotation. He told the BBC News Channel: "The right thing to do is to bring in as many banks as possible. Ones that work closely with the Royal Mail, ones that advise the government. "When you are trying to get a placing that large away, what you don't want is egg on your face if it doesn't get the investment community excited." He added: "It feels to me that this story is a bit of sour grapes from a couple of banks who weren't very close to the business. "The problem to remember as well is that the government still has a substantial shareholding that at some stage it will want to sell down." Mr Zahawi warned of the danger that could be posed should the government face the prospect of selling its remaining stake at below the launch price and that it would be "far more negative than a successful IPO with shares going up". It was common practice to see government sell-offs priced at around 20% below full value so early investors are not penalised. He said: "Let's look at the share price in six months' time when the froth has gone away when you take out the initial spike and where the shares settle. When you look at comparators ie on dividend on yield on profitability, I think the price was just about right." </body>

      <body>A community venture company has issued shares so that Suffolk villagers can raise funds to buy their local pub. The Case Is Altered, in Bentley, near Ipswich, closed in March and its owner Punch Taverns has put it on the market for £240,000. A committee of seven people has formed Bentley Community Pub Ltd to raise the money to buy and refurbish it with the aim of reopening it next spring. People can buy a minimum of five shares for £50 each. David Westley, chairman of the new company, said: "We believe we are able to turn things around here. "Evidence shows that when people do buy their pubs the community has a much greater sense of ownership and people tend to go more." Mr Westley said the new company was a not-for-profit industrial and provident society and people could buy a maximum of £20,000 worth of shares. Punch said that, although the pub was on the market, it was still looking for a new licensee to run it. A spokesman said: "It is always our preference that our pubs continue to trade as pubs. "However, we do review our estate regularly and may explore other options around the future of some sites which could better fulfil their potential under different ownership." </body>

      <description>Hoffenheim launch a protest after Bayer Leverkusen's Stefan Kiessling heads the ball through a hole in the net.</description>

      <body>Hoffenheim are set to protest against a freak goal awarded to Bayer Leverkusen when Stefan Kiessling headed the ball through a hole in the side of the net. Referee Felix Brych failed to spot that Kiessling's header flew wide of the post in the 70th minute of Leverkusen's 2-1 Bundesliga win on Friday. Hoffenheim managing director Alexander Rosen said: "It's a scandal. "That was no goal, there are no two ways about it. We are definitely going to protest." Brych, a Fifa referee, said that no player had indicated it was not a goal. "I had a slight doubt but the reaction from the players was clear - nobody was against [the decision]," Brych said. "I checked with Kiessling. But no-one, not even him, said that it wasn't a goal. The ball was in the net and for everyone on the pitch it was a legitimate goal." Meanwhile, goalscorer Kiessling has apologised saying he could "fully understand the reactions" to the goal on his Facebook page.   "After seeing the replays on television, I can clearly see that it was not a legitimate goal," he said. "During the game, after heading the ball and turning my head, I did not exactly see whether the ball had gone into the goal or not. Somehow, the ball was lying in the goal and I said exactly that to the referee. "I'm sorry for all sports fans. Naturally, it's not nice to win like that. Fairness is important in sport, for us in the club and for me personally." In April 1994, Bayern Munich beat Nuremburg 2-1 after defender Thomas Helmer was awarded a goal despite the ball not going in. Nuremburg lodged a complaint, and Germany's Football Association ordered a replay, which Bayern won 5-0 on their way to clinching the title. Hoffenheim coach Markus Gisdol said: "It's definitely bitter for us and something like this has already happened once, and that game was replayed so I think we're going to see this game again. "Anything else would be a joke. You can't replay a Bayern Munich game, but not a Hoffenheim game." Several Hoffenheim substitutes raced behind the goal to examine the netting and appeared to try to point out Brych's error. But the referee was by then powerless to overrule his original decision. Rudi Voller, Leverkusen's sporting director, said: "That's not how we wanted to win the game. The fair result would have been a 2-2." Leverkusen were leading through Sidney Sam's 26th-minute opener when the controversy happened. Germany international Kiessling headed a corner wide of the near post, and could be seen turning away in frustration before Brych awarded the goal. The referee then awarded Hoffenheim a generous penalty when Roberto Firmino was fouled a foot outside the penalty area. But Firmino's spot-kick was saved. Sven Schipplock pulled a goal back for Hoffenheim two minutes from the end, but they could not save a point and fell to their first home defeat of the season. Brych, who refereed England's 3-2 friendly win over Scotland at Wembley in August, sent off Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic during a 2-0 Champions League defeat away to Romanian side Otelul Galati in October 2011. The win took Sami Hyypia's side top, although Bayern Munich can overtake them by beating Mainz on Saturday. </body>

      <description>Manchester United slip eight points behind leaders Arsenal as Southampton score a late equaliser at Old Trafford.</description>

      <body>Manchester United manager David Moyes endured another afternoon of frustration as Southampton snatched a last-gasp equaliser to stun Old Trafford. Captain Adam Lallana tapped in from a yard out with only a minute of normal time remaining to give the visitors a share of the spoils and leave United eight points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal. The champions had looked on course for what would have been a ninth successive win over the Saints. Teenager Adnan Januzaj produced another moment of brilliance to set Robin van Persie on his way to put United in front midway through the first half. The hosts might have put the game beyond Southampton as both Van Persie and the excellent Wayne Rooney hit the crossbar. However Mauricio Pochettino's side will feel their dominance of possession more than warranted a point, even if they lacked a genuine cutting edge for long periods. For United, there had been signs that they were beginning to turn the corner after the club's worst start to a Premier League season. The movement and understanding between Rooney, Van Persie and Januzaj bordered on the telepathic. Even as Moyes's side were forced back for long periods of this game, the trio ensured this was a United side that bristled with attacking menace for all 90 minutes. Januzaj, 18, who signed a five-year contract before the game, once again displayed signs of his immense talent with a verve and energy that glowed throughout. His battle with Nathaniel Clyne was a feature of the first-half as Southampton plotted their passing angles with patience and precision, forcing United onto the back foot. Morgan Schneiderlin and Victor Wanyama pulled the strings in midfield, while the dynamism of Lallana meant Saints always had options, even if chances on goal were scarce. Jay Rodriguez headed over and Dani Osvaldo might have done better with only David De Gea to beat and, as Southampton bordered on the profligate, United were far more ruthless. Van Persie had twice gone close in the opening 20 minutes, before Rooney's sublime pass set him in on goal once more, only for an offside flag to deny him the chance to finish. However, the brilliance of Januzaj ensured United would not be denied for long. Picking the ball up in his own half, Januzaj threaded a 40-yard pass into the path of Rooney to slice Southampton open in the blink of an eye. Rooney's shot was brilliantly blocked by goalkeeper Artur Boruc, but Van Persie was quickly onto the rebound, rolling the ball beyond the despairing dive of Dejan Lovren to give United the lead. It was the first goal Southampton had conceded in almost seven hours of Premier League football but it came from a familiar source - this was Van Persie's fifth goal in as many appearances against Saints but his first for five Premier League matches. For a five-minute spell, Saints looked lost. Rooney rattled the crossbar with a thunderous shot but the visitors weathered the United storm and came again - Van Persie heading Lovren's header off his own line just after half-time. And yet, United always carried the greater threat. Their movement in attack constantly confounded Southampton's defenders, with Rooney, Van Persie and Januzaj swapping places and eluding markers at will. The Dutchman might have a second goal as he headed onto the crossbar on the hour. Moments later, Januzaj was in the thick of the action once more, unleashing a dipping, swerving left-foot drive that Boruc somehow clawed away. Though Southampton refused to lie down - Lallana testing De Gea with a low shot - hope appeared to be draining away. However, when Lovren forced Shaw's corner towards goal, Lallana got the faintest of touches to beat De Gea to earn Saints a point and extend United's poor league run to only two wins in seven matches. </body>

      <body>Chelsea fought back from a goal down to thump Cardiff after scoring an equaliser which should not have stood. Jordon Mutch ran through to put Cardiff ahead after David Luiz's mistake. But Eden Hazard levelled after Samuel Eto'o kicked the ball away as Bluebirds keeper David Marshall bounced it, which according to Fifa's rules is a foul. A well-worked Eto'o goal put Chelsea ahead and, after their boss Jose Mourinho was sent to the stands, Oscar and Hazard sealed the victory. Chelsea climb to second in the table but the scoreline was harsh on Cardiff - starting with the home side's equaliser in the 32nd minute. The laws of the game stipulate that the ball is considered under the goalkeeper's control when he bounces it, but referee Anthony Taylor allowed play to continue before Hazard fired home. Cardiff had taken the lead with a bizarre goal of their own. Luiz casually let the ball run past him after Ramires played it back to Cech, allowing Mutch to nip in and coolly slot home. The Welsh side were showing no ill-effects of a turbulent two-week period that saw the future of boss Malky Mackay put in doubt when his head of recruitment, Iain Moody, was replaced by unknown 23-year-old Kazakh Alisher Apsalyamov. Mackay has insisted he has no intention to quit, despite reports that Bluebirds owner Vincent Tan is also suggesting substitutions and tactics during games. Tan was not at Stamford Bridge and Mackay's tactics proved effective as his side soaked up Chelsea's attacks despite conceding the majority of possession, and frequently threatened on the break. John Terry twice went close to levelling with headers but it took a superb save from Petr Cech to stop Peter Odemwingie extending Cardiff's lead with a header from Peter Whittingham's free-kick. Chelsea's frustrations continued after their controversial equaliser, at least until Eto'o scored his first Premier League goal after 66 minutes by latching on to a Hazard pass and burying the ball past Marshall. The Bluebirds responded well and almost hit back when Kim Bo-Kyung stung Cech's palms. Mourinho had to watch what looked like being an anxious final 20 minutes from the stands, with Taylor ordering him from his technical area after he persistently complained to fourth official Trevor Kettle about the referee's decisions. But Oscar's fine strike from the edge of the box gave his side breathing space in the 78th minute and Hazard made it four soon after, dancing into the box before beating Marshall at his near post. </body>

      <body>England suffered a shock 15-14 defeat by Italy only one week before the start of the Rugby League World Cup. Josh Mantellato kicked a drop-goal 90 seconds from time to give Italy - at 13 the second-lowest ranked team in the World Cup - victory in Salford. England, ranked third in the world, trailed 12-4 at one stage in the first half before two Sam Tomkins tries put the home side ahead. But a Ray Nasso penalty and Mantellato's drop settled it. England meet Australia in the World Cup's opening match in Cardiff on 26 October. Italy, coached by Salford-born and raised Carlo Napolitano, deserved their victory as England failed to impress on a rain-swept afternoon. The only bright spot was provided by full-back Tomkins, who scored twice in the first half before watching his team-mates slump to defeat from the sidelines. Tomkins was taken off 16 minutes from the end as McNamara gave run-outs to 20 members of his World Cup squad. England floundered in a first-half rainstorm, which was accompanied by thunder and lightning, and were left to rue a series of early defensive lapses. McNamara would have been concerned at the way his defenders fell off the tackle to allow St Helens prop Anthony Laffranchi a soft early try and the ease with which hooker Dean Parata burrowed his way from dummy half for the visitors' second. In between those two scores, centre Carl Ablett notched England's first try in the 19th minute, touching down at the corner, despite juggling with the pass from Liam Farrell, after winger Ryan Hall had collected Kevin Sinfield's cross-field kick. As the storm clouds parted, Tomkins provided a spark for the hosts. He took James Roby's superb pass to score his first try and then got on the end of Gareth Widdop's lofted kick for his second. Sinfield was wide with his first conversion attempt and hit the post with his second - but his replacement Widdop found the target to convert Tomkins' second try and put England in front for the first time four minutes before the break. If the sight of a double rainbow at the start of the second half lifted the spirits of the spectators, it did nothing for England's players. They missed a scoring chance when Hall failed to take Gareth Hock's pass 10 metres away from the Italian line. And the Azzurri took the chance to draw level in the 69th minute with a penalty from in front of the posts by substitute Nasso. England had a chance to win it when Widdop broke clear with five minutes to go but he failed to find the supporting Rob Burrow and the missed opportunity proved costly. When Josh Charnley knocked on inside his own 20 metres, the Italians seized their chance and Mantellato was accurate with a 30-metre drop goal. Earlier, England Knights survived the scare of conceding an early try to beat Samoa 52-16, with Jack Hughes scoring a hat-trick. Elsewhere, Scotland were beaten 20-38 in a warm-up friendly against Papua New Guinea in Featherstone. Steve McCormack's side face Tonga in their World Cup opener in Workington on 29 October. The United States caused a shock by beating France 22-18 in Toulouse on Friday evening.

      <description>Replacement Gareth Davies' late try gives Cardiff Blues a dramatic win against Heineken Cup holders Toulon at the Arms Park.</description>

      <body>A late try by replacement Gareth Davies gave Cardiff Blues a dramatic win over Heineken Cup holders Toulon at the Arms Park. Rhys Patchell and Leigh Halfpenny's first-half kicking duel with Jonny Wilkinson ended level at 6-6. Wilkinson kicked three more penalties after the break with Halfpenny twice responding for the hosts. But Davies broke free from a tackle to score two minutes from the end and Halfpenny converted. Having conceded five first-half tries in defeat at Exeter Chiefs in their opening game, director of rugby Phil Davies had demanded a telling response from his players. The hosts earned a bonus point for their four-tries second-half effort at Exeter and Davies hoped they would maintain that momentum against the wealthy French club. But few could have expected the Blues to give Phil Davies such a memorable 50th birthday present as they toppled the star-studded French Top 14 team. The Blues also had to contend with a late change when skipper and hooker Matthew Rees was ruled out by illness and Wales and Lions wing Alex Cuthbert failing to come out for the second period after suffering a leg injury. Marc Breeze came into the starting line-up while ex-Toulon prop Gethin Jenkins took over the captaincy. The visitors found the Blues' defence as impenetrable as it had been porous at Sandy Park in the opening round. In midweek the Welsh region parted company with defence coach Rob Powell and announced Pontypridd head coach Dale McIntosh as his replacement. McIntosh - known affectionately as The Chief - was at Sardis Road to end 24 years of playing and coaching as they took on London Welsh in the British and Irish Cup. But he will have been heartened to learn of the Blues' defensive effort, particularly in the dying moments as Toulon tried and failed to hit back. Toulon comfortably saw off Pro12 leaders Glasgow as their title defence opened and their early, attack-minded approach seemed to indicate they were confident of a similar effort in the Welsh capital. But the Blues rose to the criticism that followed their defeat at Exeter to regain respect in Europe in conditions that began in drizzle, continued in a deluge and ended in autumn sunshine. The hosts' pack may not have matched their much-vaunted opponents at the scrum and Toulon's physical superiority was often evident at the breakdowns. But the Blues' line-out was solid and while fly-half Patchell occasionally lost concentration, his tactical kicking was impressive. A fourth-minute long-range Patchell penalty began the duel in which Wilkinson's penalty brace took his side ahead. Halfpenny levelled after lock Bakkies Botha's forearm challenge on Josh Navidi at a ruck and the teams were tied 6-6 at the break. Wilkinson added two more penalties early in the second period, but missed two more chances before Halfpenny brought the hosts level. Former England and Lions fly-half Wilkinson kicked his side ahead with a fifth shot from a narrow angle with eight minutes remaining. But after Cory Allen's break took the Blues deep into Toulon's 22, Sam Warburton maintained the momentum with his own surge. Davies, who had replaced Patchell as Wilkinson kicked his final penalty, went on an arcing run and after not being held in a tackle by Toulon's desperate defence, bounced off the synthetic surface to score. Halfpenny added the conversion and Toulon's frantic efforts to hit back were thwarted. Cardiff Blues: Leigh Halfpenny; Alex Cuthbert, Owen Williams, Cory Allen, Harry Robinson; Rhys Patchell, Lloyd Williams; Gethin Jenkins (capt), Marc Breeze, Scott Andrews, Bradley Davies, Filo Paulo, Josh Navidi, Sam Warburton, Robin Copeland. Replacements: Richard Smith for Cuthbert (41), Gareth Davies for Patchell (72), Benoit Bourrust for Andrews (59), Lou Reed for Paulo (75).

      <title>West Ham United 1-3 Manchester City</title>
      <description>Sergio Aguero scores twice as Manchester City see off West Ham to move up to fourth in the Premier League.</description>

      <body>Sergio Aguero scored twice as Manchester City saw off West Ham to go fourth in the Premier League. City tore through the middle of the Hammers' defence for their opener, with Alvaro Negredo leaving Fernandinho's pass for Aguero to calmly slot home. Aguero made it 2-0 with a header from David Silva's free-kick but Vaz Te replied with an acrobatic strike. That set up a tense finish, until Silva found the top corner to seal City's first away league win of the season. City's form on the road has been the biggest concern for new manager Manuel Pellegrini this season, and they badly needed a solid display in the first of four successive away games in the league, Champions League and League Cup. They began strongly in east London, establishing a platform in midfield and controlling that area of the pitch. West Ham were chasing shadows and City's slick movement and passing saw them take an early lead through Aguero, who galloped clear unopposed after 16 minutes. That was only the second goal West Ham have conceded in open play in the Premier League this season, but Sam Allardyce's side were looking vulnerable every time City came at them. Aguero made space for another shot that just eluded Silva after squirming out of Jussi Jaaskelainen's grasp, while the Hammers keeper did well to keep out a curling Yaya Toure shot after a mistake by Winston Reid. The home side, who were again operating without an out-and-out striker, did enjoy spells of pressure too but they lacked a cutting edge when they put the ball into the box and ended the first half without managing a shot on target. Things got bleaker for West Ham after the break when Aguero met Silva's free-kick with a pin-point near-post header - his first in the Premier League - to double City's lead. But the Hammers responded with their best spell of the match, culminating with Vaz Te's overhead kick after Ravel Morrison had hooked the ball back into the danger zone. City had gone ahead in both of their away Premier League defeats this season, and their lead looked fragile again as West Ham bombarded their box with crosses and free-kicks. This time, however, there was a different outcome. In contrast to their displays in defeats at Cardiff and Aston Villa, Pellegrini's side kept their defensive discipline, and got their reward at the other end too. Negredo could have settled City's nerves when he slammed an angled shot against the underside of the bar, while Jaaskelainen had to be alert to keep out efforts from Aguero and Aleksandar Kolarov. Instead it was down to Silva to put the game beyond West Ham's reach. He met Aguero's clever backheel on the edge of the area to curl an unstoppable shot into the top corner and ensure City embark on their next trip, to CSKA Moscow in the Champions League on Wednesday, on the back of a win. West Ham boss Sam Allardyce: "City were very, very good. Because they were so good we could not get near our best. "The lads had a right go after going 2-0 down. Before that, we were nowhere near our best. We had to be at our best, and they had to have an off day, for us to beat them. "For the size, power and money they have, we could not live with them today. It showed at times. "We could have felt sorry for ourselves and lost 4-0, but we made a spirited comeback. We did not find the form we had at Tottenham. "It did not work today. The lads did not apply themselves as well." Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: "Winning the game was the most important thing for us. We played very well, and the best player for West Ham was their goalkeeper. "We played as well as we did against Aston Villa [when City lost 3-2]. Someone asked me if I needed to change the way we played away, and I do not think so. "This team should always play in attacking way because of the players we have. "We were absolutely sure playing the way we were, we would win away. We lost against Cardiff and Aston Villa, but football is like that." </body>

      <title>RBS decision imminent, says Osborne</title>

      <body>George Osborne expects to make a decision about how to break up the state-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) in "the next two or three weeks", he has told the Daily Telegraph. He said the government - which owns 81% of RBS - was considering hiving off weaker parts into a "bad bank". The decision was "top of his in-tray", the chancellor told the Telegraph. Meanwhile, chief executive Ross McEwan has told staff not to be distracted by speculation on the bank's future. RBS was bailed out for £45bn in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. "We are looking at the case for a bad bank and, if not a bad bank, what is the alternative strategy that really gets on top of the problems in that bank and goes on being what I want it to be which is a bank supporting the British economy," Mr Osborne said. He added that he was considering offering shares to the public in Lloyds, the other major bank in which the state holds a substantial stake. "We are now looking actively at a retail offer for the next tranche of Lloyds shares," he said. But he said the government was not, "at the moment, close to the stage of being able to sell RBS shares". He added: "RBS was a much more complex bank. "To be fair to management past and present, it was a bank that was in a lot more trouble." He said "the clean-up job" had been "more difficult but we have got to make these decisions now about the future for RBS". Investment bank Rothschild has been advising the government on whether the bank's bad loans should be hived off into a separate entity. But in a memo to staff, Ross McEwan - who took over as RBS chief executive at the start of this month - said a bad bank would only affect a small proportion of RBS's overall business. Analysts have said that the vast bulk of RBS's assets are likely to be unaffected by the review. "The truth is, the review and its outcomes are important, but not in the way many people think," Mr McEwan said. "The future of this company will not be about whether we operate in particular areas or where our problem assets sit. The future of this company is about how good a job we do for our customers, including those who are having difficulty repaying their loans. "But the debate you read about in the papers - and that has taken up too much time of the management team - has been about what is now a small proportion of our activity." He said the bank was "taking responsibility for resolving these debates", "Let's address the legitimate concerns shareholders and other stakeholders have," he added. "And then let's get on with building a great bank for customers." Mr McEwan replaced Stephen Hester, who spent four years trying to repair the bank's balance sheet. </body>

      <body>The Aberdeen North Labour MP Frank Doran is to stand down at the next general election in 2015. He has represented the people of the north east city at Westminster since 1987. Mr Doran told the party he believed it was now time to step aside and give someone else the chance to fight for the seat. The 64-year-old said it had been an "enormous privilege to represent the city in parliament". Mr Doran was elected MP for Aberdeen South in 1987 and subsequently for Aberdeen Central in 1997. Following boundary changes in 2005, he was then elected to represent Aberdeen North. The MP said: "By the next election I will have been an MP for 23 years I think it is time to step aside to give someone else the chance from the Labour Party the opportunity to represent Aberdeen in Westminster." Mr Doran was shadow minister for energy between 1988 and 1992, he has sat on the culture, media and sport select committee and has campaigned for improved safety in the North Sea. </body>

      <title>GP exam 'unfair to minorities'</title>
      <description>British ethnic minority doctors are four times more likely than white candidates to fail their clinical GP exam, an investigation commissioned by the General Medical Council finds.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24572522</url>

      <body>UK ethnic minority doctors are four times more likely than white candidates to fail their clinical GP exam, the General Medical Council has found. The review into 5,000 candidates was ordered after ethnic minority students complained the exam was unfair. Prof Aneez Esmail, an expert on racism in the NHS who led the investigation, said "unconscious bias" could explain the findings. But the Royal College of GPs, which sets the exams, denies they are unfair. RCGP chairwoman Dr Clare Gerada said the college took equality and diversity issues "extremely seriously". She added that the college: "strongly refutes any allegations that the exam is discriminatory in any way". The Clinical Skills Assessment (CSA) - introduced in 2010 - is a practical test in which trainee GPs are assessed by an examiner while they treat actors in a mock-surgery setting. They have up to four attempts to take the test which they must pass before they can practise as a GP. During the six-month review for the GMC, Prof Esmail analysed data on more than 5,000 candidates who sat the CSA exam over a two-year period. He said he could not exclude racial discrimination as the cause of the findings. He told BBC One's Breakfast: "Many of us who do work in this area describe the problem of unconscious bias. "So I think that what might be happening, especially with the white British graduates compared to the ethnic minority British graduates, is that - without realising it even perhaps - they may be assessing it in a different way." "So I don't think that it's the examiners saying 'oh we don't like ethnic minorities' - it doesn't work like that anymore," he added. "It's all this unconscious stuff that goes on which we need to be aware of." He said all British doctors, whether white or from ethnic minorities, had "gone through medical school and passed all that and so we're not talking about people who aren't as good as - they're exactly the same". He said the test was "a relatively new technique that's being used and it's bound to improve as time goes on". He has made a number of recommendations to try to combat bias in the exam including having more examiners and actors who are from ethnic minority backgrounds. But the RGCP's Dr Clare Gerada said the review found "no evidence, either through the examiners or through the actors, or through the process of the examination, of discrimination". She added that, "in fact, what it showed was that it was probably preparedness for the exam that was a factor". "We already take comprehensive steps to ensure that the exam is fair and equitable to all candidates," she told BBC News. "This exam is designed for doctors to practise independently; it is not an exam that has to be passed by everyone. I think that is a very important issue. "Of course we cannot be complacent and we continue to make sure the exam does not have bias built in." The review also found that trainee GPs from abroad were 14 times more likely to fail the CSA exam than white British doctors. "We also know that eventually they pass," Dr Gerada said. "We also know that this is a culturally specific exam - it stands to reason if you are born and brought up in this country, within the NHS, that you have an advantage," she added. "If I go to India and sit an exam designed for doctors to practise in India, I will be at a disadvantage." GP Una Coales, meanwhile, said that, "because they use predominantly white actors, even the white actors may not even be aware that they have hidden bias against foreigners". "So if they hear an Indian dialect, for instance, they might pretend that they don't understand them and they might subconsciously withhold vital clues," she said. She said the actors could "give away the agenda or the concern right away if he happens to like you or can withhold it for eight minutes of a 10-minute exam". Organisations representing ethnic minority doctors have threatened legal action against the RCGP. Dr Ramesh Mehta, president of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO), said: "Hundreds of doctors' careers have been damaged because they have repeatedly failed the CSA exam. "They are facing institutional bias and are unfairly failing the exam despite extensive training and knowledge." BAPIO has been given permission to launch a judicial review against the RCGP and the GMC over the exam. The General Medical Council said it took the findings of the independent review seriously. "We agree with Prof Esmail that there is no room for complacency - we want to work with him and all those involved in this area," chief executive Niall Dickson said. "We are duty-bound to act where there is evidence of a problem and his report and recommendations make a powerful case for action." </body>

      <title>National teacher strike may go ahead</title>
      <description>Teaching unions say they will press ahead with plans for a one-day national strike before Christmas if the dispute is not resolved.</description>

      <body>Teaching unions say they will press ahead with a one-day national strike before Christmas if a dispute over pay, pensions and jobs is not resolved. Nearly 3,500 schools were closed or partially closed on Thursday in London, Cumbria, and the South East, North East and South West of England. This was the third in a rolling campaign of regional walk-outs. A national strike would include Wales, as teachers' pay and conditions are determined by Westminster. Teachers are angry about the introduction of performance related pay and changes which mean they will have to work until they are at least 65 to be eligible for a full pension, rising to 68 for those born after 1978, say the unions. They also complain of excessive workloads, changes to their working conditions and job cuts. Teachers in the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber region walked out on 1 October. This followed a strike across the North West on 27 June. So far Wales has not been affected by the strikes. Teachers in Northern Ireland and Scotland deal with their devolved governments on pay and conditions and so will remain unaffected by this dispute. The NASUWT says it is considering its next steps but it is likely that the planned one-day national strike will go ahead if the government does not address its concerns. The union's general secretary Chris Keates said: "The rolling programme of strike action has commanded support from the overwhelming majority of teachers. "The Secretary of State can no longer claim that the majority of teachers support his reforms. Teachers' anger and frustration is much in evidence and he now needs to begin to seriously address their concerns. "The NASUWT National Action Committee is keeping matters under review." The government restated its disappointment that the unions were striking over measures to allow head teachers to pay good teachers more. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said only around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed on Thursday, compared with 60% who walked out in the national strikes of November 2011. The government says that it has met the unions frequently to discuss their concerns and will continue to do so. </body>

      <title>Major piracy site to be shut down</title>
      <description>IsoHunt, a major website that indexed illegal files, is to close and pay $110m (£68m) to a US movie industry body.</description>

      <body>IsoHunt, a popular website offering BitTorrents of mostly pirated material, is to shut down following a court settlement. The site's owner, Canadian Gary Fung, has agreed to pay $110m (£68m) to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). MPAA chairman Chris Dodd said the move was a "major step forward" for legitimate commerce online. In a blog post, Mr Fung said: "It's sad to see my baby go." The site is currently still online, but will soon be shut. It is one of the most popular sites of its kind on the internet. A group of companies, including Disney, Paramount and Twentieth Century Fox, accused the site of wilfully infringing copyright by listing millions of popular movies and TV programmes - in a court battle that has lasted for more than seven years. Now Mr Fung has agreed to settle. He added: "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race and I have remained faithful. 10.5 years of IsoHunt has been a long journey by any business definition and forever in internet start-up time. "It started as a programming hobby in my university days that has become so, so much more." Court documents acknowledged that it is unlikely that Mr Fung's company could pay $110m, and that the MPAA would probably receive between $2m and $4m. Like a similar site, The Pirate Bay, that has been blocked in the UK by a court order, IsoHunt did not host pirated material itself. It instead acted as a directory of sources from which to download illegal files. According to court documents, Mr Fung's defence hinged on this degree of separation - and argued that it was the users of IsoHunt responsible for distributing pirated material, not IsoHunt. The Californian court disagreed. "It sends a strong message that those who build businesses around encouraging, enabling, and helping others to commit copyright infringement are themselves infringers, and will be held accountable for their illegal actions," said MPAA chairman Mr Dodd. "The successful outcome of this landmark lawsuit will also will help preserve jobs and protect the tens of thousands of businesses in the creative industries, whose hard work and investments are exploited by sites like IsoHunt." Ahead of the ruling, Mr Fung had taken to social news site Reddit to take part in an AMAA - Ask Me Almost Anything - session. In it, he described himself as a "reluctant revolutionary", and backed calls for copyright reform. He said he did not hold a disregard for the law, and acted upon requests to remove links to pirated content when the company was made aware. He also said the industry could render sites like IsoHunt obsolete if it offered simultaneous releases worldwide, as well as digital offerings that were cheaper than physical copies. His thoughts echoed findings by a trio of researchers at George Mason University in Virginia, US. Their site piracydata.org has been collating the weekly top 10 most-pirated films and investigating whether legal digital methods were available. They found that half of the movies in the list were not available to access legally online. Furthermore, none of the 10 titles could be streamed - arguably the most straightforward way to consume media online. However, in contrast, efforts by Fox to curb piracy of TV series The Walking Dead fell flat. Despite the first episode of the latest series being made available to stream free online, the programme was still illegally downloaded more than 500,000 times, according to data gathered by Torrentfreak.com.

      <title>'Electronic blood' computer tested</title>
      <description>A new brain-inspired computing device powered via a liquid instead of through wires has been demonstrated at IBM's Zurich laboratory.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24571219</url>
      <date>1382115902</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70552000/jpg/_70552415_8549310302_50612fbc36_c.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>IBM has unveiled a prototype of a new brain-inspired computer powered by what it calls "electronic blood". The firm says it is learning from nature by building computers fuelled and cooled by a liquid, like our minds. The human brain packs phenomenal computing power into a tiny space and uses only 20 watts of energy - an efficiency IBM is keen to match. Its new "redox flow" system pumps an electrolyte "blood" through a computer, carrying power in and taking heat out. A very basic model was demonstrated this week at the technology giant's Zurich lab by Dr Patrick Ruch and Dr Bruno Michel. Their vision is that by 2060, a one petaflop computer that would fill half a football field today, will fit on your desktop. "We want to fit a supercomputer inside a sugarcube. To do that, we need a paradigm shift in electronics - we need to be motivated by our brain," says Michel. "The human brain is 10,000 times more dense and efficient than any computer today. "That's possible because it uses only one - extremely efficient - network of capillaries and blood vessels to transport heat and energy - all at the same time." IBM's brainiest computer to date is Watson, which famously trounced two champions of the US TV quiz show Jeopardy. The victory was hailed as a landmark for cognitive computing - machine had surpassed man. But the contest was unfair, says Michel. The brains of Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter ran on only 20 watts of energy, whereas Watson needed 85,000 watts. Energy efficiency - not raw computing power - is the guiding principle for the next generation of computer chips, IBM believes. Our current 2D silicon chips, which for half a century have doubled in power through Moore's Law, are approaching a physical limit where they cannot shrink further without overheating. "The computer industry uses $30bn of energy and throws it out of the window. We're creating hot air for $30bn," says Michel. "Ninety-nine per cent of a computer's volume is devoted to cooling and powering. Only 1% is used to process information. And we think we've built a good computer?" "The brain uses 40% of its volume for functional performance - and only 10% for energy and cooling." Michel's vision is for a new "bionic" computing architecture, inspired by one of the laws of nature - allometric scaling - where an animal's metabolic power increases with its body size. An elephant, for example, weighs as much as a million mice. But it consumes 30 times less energy, and can perform a task even a million mice cannot accomplish. The same principle holds true in computing, says Michel, whose bionic vision has three core design features. The first is 3D architecture, with chips stacked high, and memory storage units interwoven with processors. "It's the difference between a low-rise building, where everything is spread out flat, and a high rise building. You shorten the connection distances," says Matthias Kaiserswerth, director of IBM Zurich. But there is a very good reason today's chips are gridiron pancakes - exposure to the air is critical to dissipate the intense heat generated by ever-smaller transistors. Piling chips on top of one another locks this heat inside - a major roadblock to 3D computing. IBM's solution is integrated liquid cooling - where chips are interlayered with tiny water pipes. The art of liquid cooling has been demonstrated by Aquasar and put to work inside the German supercomputer SuperMUC which - perversely - harnesses warm water to cool its circuits. SuperMUC consumes 40% less electricity as a result. But for IBM to truly match the marvels of the brain, there is a third evolutionary step it must achieve - simultaneous liquid fuelling and cooling. Just as blood gives sugar in one hand and takes heat with another, IBM is looking for a fluid that can multitask. Vanadium is the best performer in their current laboratory test system - a type of redox flow unit - similar to a simple battery. First a liquid - the electrolyte - is charged via electrodes, then pumped into the computer, where it discharges energy to the chip. Redox flow is far from a new technology, and neither is it especially complex. But IBM is the first to stake its chips on this "electronic blood" as the food of future computers - and will attempt to optimise it over the coming decades to achieve zettascale computing. "To power a zettascale computer today would take more electricity than is produced in the entire world," says Michel. He is confident that the design hurdles in his bionic model can be surmounted - not least that a whole additional unit is needed to charge the liquid. And while other labs are betting on spintronics, quantum computing, or photonics to take us beyond silicon, the Zurich team believes the real answer lies right behind our eyes. "Just as computers help us understand our brains, if we understand our brains we'll make better computers," says director Matthias Kaiserswerth. He would like to see a future Watson win Jeopardy on a level playing field. Other experts in computing agree that IBM's 3D principles are sound. But as to whether bionic computing will be the breakthrough technology, the jury is out. "The idea of using a fluid to both power and cool strikes me as very novel engineering - killing two birds with one stone," says Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey's computing department. "But every form of future computing has its champions - whether it be quantum computing, DNA computing or neuromorphic computing. "There is a long way to go from the lab to having one of these sitting under your desk." Prof Steve Furber, leader of the SpiNNaker project agrees that "going into the third dimension" has more to offer than continually shrinking transistors. "The big issue with 3D computing is getting the heat out - and liquid cooling could be very effective if integrated into 3D systems as proposed here," he told the BBC. "But all of the above will not get electronics down to the energy-efficiency of the brain. "That will require many more changes, including a move to analogue computation instead of digital. "It will also involve breakthroughs in new non-Turing models of computation, for example based on an understanding of how the brain processes information." </body>

      <body>Friends have paid tribute to Felix Dexter, who died on Friday. The comedian and actor had suffered from myeloma, a type of bone marrow cancer. Reports said he was 52. Colleagues and peers used Twitter to praise the St Kitts-born Londoner, with comedian David Baddiel mourning a "real loss to comedy". He came to prominence in the flagship black comedy The Real McCoy and later performed for a season with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Fellow comedian Sean Hughes wrote on Twitter: "So so sad to hear about the truly wonderful Felix Dexter passing away. "I hope you can feel the love in the comedy community fella. Rip." Bill Bailey wrote: "Very sad news about my old friend Felix Dexter. A brilliant comedian, a superb comic actor, a lovely man I feel privileged to have known." Once named Time Out comedian of the year, Dexter also featured in iconic BBC comedies The Fast Show and Absolutely Fabulous. More recently, he played three of the main roles in BBC Two's sketch show Bellamy's People and is currently appearing in Citizen Khan. His close friend, BBC Radio London presenter Eddie Nestor - who acted alongside Dexter for three years in The Real McCoy - told BBC Radio 5 Live: "It's a sad day. It's a really sad day. I went to see him and we talked and we laughed, and we laughed really hard. "This is somebody who's been diagnosed with a terminal illness and you find yourself laughing really hard, belly laughs." He added: "We've lost a talented, intelligent, articulate performer who could touch - who could reach out." The Fast Show's Paul Whitehouse acted with Dexter in Bellamy's People. Whitehouse told BBC Radio 5 live he was privileged to be close to the comedian and actor. "He was a very modest, a very private man," he said. "It was an honour to be close to him. "He stuck in people's minds, Felix. There's been such an outpouring of warmth and affection for him." Before entering comedy, Dexter studied law - something he said helped him deal with hecklers. He named Billy Connolly and the late American comics Richard Pryor and Bill Hicks among his influences, and remained on the stand-up circuit throughout his career. Later he featured in long-running staples Have I Got News You and Grumpy Old Men, as well as the influential Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge. As an actor, he had parts in Casualty and the Bill and appeared in the West End alongside Christian Slater. </body>

      <title>Where the penalty for miscarriage is jail</title>

      <body>El Salvador has one of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the world. A side-effect is that women who suffer miscarriages are sometimes suspected of inducing an abortion - and can even be jailed for murder. Glenda Xiomara Cruz was crippled by abdominal pain and heavy bleeding in the early hours of 30 October 2012. The 19-year-old from Puerto El Triunfo, eastern El Salvador, went to the nearest public hospital where doctors said she had lost her baby. It was the first she knew about the pregnancy as her menstrual cycle was unbroken, her weight practically unchanged, and a pregnancy test in May 2012 had been negative. Four days later she was charged with aggravated murder - intentionally murdering the 38-to-42 week foetus - at a court hearing she was too sick to attend. The hospital had reported her to the police for a suspected abortion. After two emergency operations and three weeks in hospital she was moved to Ilopango women's prison on the outskirts of the capital San Salvador. Then last month she was sentenced to 10 years in jail, the judge ruling that she should have saved the baby's life. Her lawyer, Dennis Munoz Estanley, says the legal system has an inbuilt "presumption of guilt" making it hard for women to prove their innocence. "She is yet another innocent victim of our unjust and discriminatory legal system which jails poor, young women who suffer obstetric complications for murder on the most flimsy evidence," he says. Xiomara's father describes the conviction as a "terrible injustice". He testified in court that his daughter had endured years of domestic violence at the hands of her partner. And yet the prosecution - which sought a 50-year jail term - relied heavily on this man's allegation that she had intentionally killed the foetus. Xiomara has not seen her four-year-old daughter since the miscarriage. El Salvador is one of five countries with a total ban on abortion, along with Nicaragua, Chile, Honduras and Dominican Republic. Since 1998, the law has allowed no exceptions - even if a woman is raped, her life is at risk or the foetus is severely deformed. More than 200 women were reported to the police between 2000 and 2011, of whom 129 were prosecuted and 49 convicted - 26 for murder (with sentences of 12 to 35 years) and 23 for abortion, according to research by Citizens' Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion. Seven more have been convicted since 2012. The study underlines that these women are overwhelmingly poor, unmarried and poorly educated - and they are usually denounced by public hospital staff. Not a single criminal case originated from the private health sector where thousands of abortions are believed to take place annually. Munoz has worked with 29 of the incarcerated women, helping secure the early release of eight. "Only one intentionally induced an abortion, the other 28 suffered natural obstetric complications but were jailed for murder without any direct evidence," he says. Last year when Maria Teresa Rivera suffered a miscarriage, she was sentenced to 40 years in jail for aggravated murder. Like Xiomara, Teresa, 28, had no pregnancy symptoms before sudden severe pain and bleeding, and was reported to police by the public hospital where she had sought emergency help. The scientific evidence was flimsy, according to Munoz who will soon lodge an appeal, and the prosecution relied heavily on a colleague of hers, who testified that Rivera had said she "might be" pregnant a full 11 months before the miscarriage. A textile factory worker, she was the family's only breadwinner and her eight-year-old son is now living in dire poverty with his grandmother. Cristina Quintanilla's story is different. On 24 October 2004, the 18-year-old from rural San Miguel was seven months pregnant with her second child, living with her mother in the capital to be near a hospital for the birth. Her boyfriend was working in the US, but the couple were excited buying baby clothes and saving food tokens. "Around midnight I felt an immense pain, I thought I was dying," Quintanilla says. "I was banging on the bathroom door to get my mum's attention when I felt the baby drop out. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital." Her mother called the police - a typical step for Salvadorans in an emergency, who took them to hospital. Quintanilla was given an anaesthetic, and interrogated when she came round. Then she was handcuffed to the hospital bed, charged with manslaughter and transferred to a police cell. The first judge dismissed the case, but the prosecution appealed, upgrading the charge to aggravated murder. Quintanilla was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in jail, where she was vilified as a child killer. Her son Daniel, then only four, spent four years living with his great-grandmother until Munoz succeeded in having the sentence reduced to three years. "The medical reports couldn't explain why the baby died, but the prosecutor made me out to be a criminal who could have saved my baby even though I had passed out in pain," she says. "I will never understand why they did this to me, I lost four years of my life and still don't know why I lost my baby." Morena Herrera from Citizens' Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion says these cases have had a chilling effect, with many pregnant poor women who suffer miscarriages or complications during pregnancy "too afraid to seek medical help". "I would be terrified to go a public hospital as there is no benefit of doubt given to young women, we are presumed guilty and jailed," says Bessy Ramirez, 27, from San Salvador. "We cannot even rely on health staff to put their prejudices aside and treat us confidentially." The strict abortion law has other serious human rights implications. Suicide was the most common cause of death in 2011 among 10-to-19-year-old girls, half of whom were pregnant, according to Health Ministry figures. It was also the third most common cause of maternal mortality. Earlier this year, the plight of lupus sufferer Beatriz, 22, attracted international condemnation after the Supreme Court refused to authorise an abortion, even though her life was at risk and the foetus too deformed to be viable. Beatriz's health deteriorated while the court deliberated for several months. She gave birth at 27 weeks. The baby died within hours. Individual members of the current FMLN government, particularly Health Minister Maria Isabel Rodriguez, criticised the abortion law during the controversy over Beatriz's case. But the government has made no attempt to repeal or relax the law since coming to power in 2009, as it remains popular with large parts of the conservative population, who revere the Church and pro-life religious groups such as Si a la Vida (Yes to Life). The Arena Party, which is strongly allied with the Church, is favourite to win next year's General Election. But Esther Major, Amnesty International's El Salvador expert, describes the country's abortion law as "cruel and discriminatory". "Women and girls end up in prison for being unwilling, or simply tragically unable, to carry the pregnancy to term," she says. "It makes seeking hospital treatment for complications during pregnancy, including a miscarriage, a dangerous lottery. "It cannot be in the interests of society to criminalise women and girls in this way." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>The drugs derived from deadly poisons</title>
      <description>The deadliest poisons are often central to the most important medicines, as Michael Mosley explains.</description>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

A silver Skoda Octavia was shot at after four men inside argued with six men at the garage on Whitefield Drive, Kirkby, at 01:15 BST. The driver, 61, was not thought to be the intended target, police said. He is being treated in hospital for serious injuries to his arm and chest and his condition is said to be stable. There were no reports of other injuries. All the men had left the scene when emergency services arrived and a search for them is ongoing, police said. They are all described as being white, with five wearing dark-coloured clothing and the sixth wearing a cream coloured Adidas-type top. Supt Kevin Wellens said: "This thoughtless and reckless type of behaviour cannot be tolerated, and we are fortunate that no one else was injured particularly as this took place on a garage forecourt. "I would appeal to members of the community who know the people involved to come forward so we can take positive action and take the offenders off the streets before anyone else gets hurt." </body>

      <title>Trauma centre 'alternative to Maze'</title>
      <description>Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt says an international trauma centre should be built as an alternative to the Maze Peace Centre.</description>

      <body>Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt has said an international trauma centre should be built as an alternative to the Maze Peace Centre. Mr Nesbitt made the proposal during his speech at his party's annual conference. EU funding of £18m was removed after the DUP withdrew its support for the proposed peace centre on the site of the former prison. Mr Nesbitt said what was missing from the debate was an alternative plan. "I offer that alternative, an alternative that addresses the hidden legacy of the Troubles - poor mental health and well-being. I am sorry to report, we are world-leaders in this field," he said. "Let us create an international mental health centre: a facility that will be a global centre of excellence to help those who suffer trauma, whatever the cause. I am talking about the best in the world." He added: "The world has been generous to us, with their support and their money. "Let us repay them with a centre that will offer help and hope to everyone. Let Northern Ireland become known as the 'go to' place for soldiers traumatised in war, to children traumatised by a gun attack on their school campus, to the survivors of train and plane crashes." He suggested Ormiston House in east Belfast as a possible venue for the new trauma centre, saying it would cost a fraction of the £18m funding for the Maze peace centre. Ormiston House, a 19th Century mansion set on a 13 acre site close to Stormont, is owned by the Northern Ireland Assembly. It bought the Grade B listed building for £9m in 2001, but ten years later, it put the property on the market with an asking price of just £2.5m. It was not sold and the price had since dropped to £1.6m. As UUP leader Mr Nesbitt campaigned against the proposed peace centre at the Maze. "We forced Peter Robinson into a massive u-turn on the Maze, and we did it without a riot, without street protests, without so much as a white line protest. Brains, not brawn," he told the conference. He said another fight his party was committed to was against the "republican campaign for equivalence". Mr Nesbitt said republican paramilitaries had chosen to get involved in violence, they had not been forced into it. "If I forever associate a united Ireland with no warning bombs like Bloody Friday and La Mon, is that my fault? Republicans chose it should be that way," he said. "I believe history will record that among the many things the IRA blew away was the chance for a united Ireland. "By contrast, in a few months time, Scottish nationalists will see a referendum on Scottish independence. Not a gun discharged. Not a bomb detonated. Not a single act of terror required." Mr Nesbitt said the Ulster Unionists wanted the education portfolio at Stormont and would strive to bring in a single education system in Northern Ireland. The Ulster Unionist leader also called for a new covenant with the people of Northern Ireland. "A covenant that recognises that we can do better for all our people by shaping a fairer education system, a stronger economy, better housing and a health service not only free at the point of delivery but with delivery points that are accessible and appropriate to the needs of our people," he said. The speech was Mr Nesbitt's second as party leader - a period which has seen three sitting MLAs quit the party because of differences. Basil McCrea and John McCallister left to form the new party NI21, and David McNarry switched to UKIP. Earlier a prominent speaker was Jim Nicholson, the party's candidate in next year's European elections that will be the first to be fought under Mr Nesbitt's leadership. Regional Development Minister Danny Kennedy told the conference it was a long time since the UUP was so united and the DUP so divided. Other speakers will include the new shadow secretary of state for Northern Ireland, Ivan Lewis. </body>

      <body>Roads and shops have been closed as flash flooding caused chaos around Cardiff on Saturday afternoon following heavy rain. Areas affected included Pentrebane, Llandaff, Roath, Cathays and parts of north Cardiff. Police were forced to close roads in Ely and Culverhouse Cross as localised flooding made conditions treacherous. At least six fire engines were dealing with separate incidents across the city at one point. South Wales Police said traffic was at a standstill around the Culverhouse Cross shopping area and warned people to keep away. A spokesperson said officers were closing the road leading to Marks and Spencer and Tesco at Culverhouse Cross after both shops had been affected by the rain. Water was reported to be getting into both stores forcing people to be evacuated. There were also said to be several flooding incidents in Ely, including one at a private property, and Mill Road was closed. Eluned Haf, of Southerndown in the Vale of Glamorgan, said she was stuck for two hours in the Marks and Spencer car park after the shop was evacuated. "I was taking the kids off to my mam at Culverhouse Cross and the rain came down," she said. "I got into the MandS car park and thought 'thank God for that'. I went to hand the kids to my mam and the whole building was evacuated. "I was stuck in the car park for two hours." She said there was gridlock on the roads in the area as the nearby Tesco was also evacuated. </body>

      <body>A service has taken place to mark the first anniversary of a mother's death in a series of hit-and-runs in Cardiff. Karina Menzies, 31, was killed outside Ely fire station while on a school run with two of her three children. Matthew Tvrdon, 32, who has paranoid schizophrenia, drove on an eight-mile "journey of mayhem" killing Ms Menzies and injuring 17 others. He admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was detained under the Mental Health Act. He also admitted seven counts of attempted murder and other charges including three counts of grievous bodily harm with intent. A memorial party was held on Friday evening by Ms Menzies' sister Samantha who is bringing up her three nieces Sophie, 12, Ellie, nine, and Tiana, four. And a church service was held on Saturday at Ely's Church of the Resurrection before the family held a private memorial where lanterns and fireworks will be released. The church became a focus for the community in the aftermath of the tragedy. "The year has been absolutely crazy," said 27-year-old Samantha. "My partner Lee and I are just run off our feet but we wouldn't have it any other way. "The girls are doing well and doing well in school. They obviously have their moments though. "The memorial party was a way for me to thank people for what they've done for the family and to thank the community." Terror was brought to west Cardiff for 30 minutes in October last year when Tvrdon was said in court to have used his van as a "weapon". Adults and children were injured in collisions in Ely and nearby Leckwith as he knocked people over like "skittles". In the most serious incident he targeted Ms Menzies as she walked on the forecourt of Ely fire station with two of her children, Ellie and Tiana. Sophie was on holiday in Florida at the time. She pushed her children out of the way before the van hit her. Tvrdon was told he would be released from Ashworth maximum security hospital in Merseyside only if a mental health tribunal was satisfied he should be released. The Reverend Jan Gould, priest-in-charge at the Church of the Resurrection, said: "The tragedy devastated our community last year and I think it's important that we mark this first anniversary. "Some of the victims were in hospital last year and so were unable to attend the service we had on the weekend it all happened. "They have said they would like an opportunity to attend something in church as a way of helping them to 'move on'. "I hope this service will give the community the opportunity to come together again and show their support for those whose lives were completely turned upside down a year ago in that dreadful incident." </body>

      <body>Tunisian security forces have killed at least nine suspected Islamist militants who are blamed for a deadly attack on a police patrol, officials say. They say at least three other suspects were arrested in the operation in the Mount Taouyer area, about 70km (44 miles) west of the capital, Tunis. Two policemen died when they were attacked in the area on Thursday. Interior Ministry spokesman Mohamed Ali Aroui said the militants belonged to the Salafist Ansar al-Sharia group. The group has been declared a terrorist organisation by the government and the interior ministry spokesman told reporters on Saturday that the three-day operation "has been a success". About two tonnes of materials used to make explosives were also seized. The killing of the two police officers led to an angry response from security forces when Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki, Prime Minister Ali Larayedh and other senior officials attended a memorial service for the men on Friday. The leaders were forced to leave the ceremony because of the hostility. Ansar al-Sharia has been blamed for the murders of two secular opposition politicians earlier this year. Their deaths also triggered mass protests against Tunisia's Islamist-led government. Several other militant groups - including al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb - also operate in the region. But the latest clashes were significantly closer to the capital than previous fighting with suspected Islamists. Since the popular revolt that sparked the "Arab Spring" in 2011, Tunisia has seen a rise in attacks by militants. A coalition led by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party was elected in 2011. But some government critics accuse it of being soft on hardline Islamist forces - charges it strongly denies. </body>

      <body>At least 16 people have been killed and more than 30 injured after a suicide bomber blew himself up in a crowded restaurant in the central Somali town of Beledweyne. The Islamist militant group al-Shabab has said it carried out the attack. The Somali government, backed by troops from several African countries, is fighting al-Shabab for control of the country. Al-Shabab said its target was Ethiopian and Djiboutian soldiers in Beledweyne. The bombing occurred at a tea shop popular with the troops in Beledweyne, 300km (185 miles) north of the capital, Mogadishu, close to the border with Ethiopia. "Our main target was Ethiopian and Djibouti troops who invaded our country," Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, al-Shabab's military operations spokesman, said. But witnesses, including a Somali MP in Beledweyne, Dahir Amin Jessow, have told the BBC that most of those killed were civilians. "There is a lack of medicine in the hospital and they can't cope with the flood of wounded patients, so we asked the central government to send us planes to evacuate patients," Mr Jessow said by phone. Al-Shabab militants have been driven out of Somalia's major towns, including Mogadishu and the key southern port of Kismayo, by a UN-mandated African Union force of some 18,000 soldiers. But the militants still control large parts of southern Somalia. Last month, the group claimed the attack on the Westgate shopping centre in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, in which 67 people died during a four-day siege. It said it staged the attack in response to Kenya's army carrying out operations on Somali territory. </body>

      <body>Opposition supporters in the Maldives have staged protests after police intervened to stop the presidential election from taking place. Police prevented ballot papers from being sent out on Saturday, saying two of the three candidates had failed to approve the registry of voters. The elections commission has accused the police of exceeding their mandate The Maldives has been in turmoil since ex-President Mohamed Nasheed was ousted in disputed circumstances in 2012. The first round of the election, held earlier this month, was won by Mr Nasheed, the Maldives' first democratically elected president. But that result was annulled and the second round of voting postponed amid allegations of electoral fraud, although international monitors said the process had been free and fair. Mr Nasheed has been leading the peaceful protests in the capital, Male. His supporters blocked a main road, drinking tea and eating snacks in a display of civil disobedience. Protesters spread out banners calling for the election to take place immediately and asking, "where is my vote". The current president, Mohamed Waheed Hassan - who had already pulled out of the leadership race after performing badly in the annulled first round - has proposed that the re-run be held on 26 October. "I hope that over that week, any outstanding problems will be ironed out," he told the Associated Press, saying he wanted to ensure a new president was installed before the end of his term on 11 November. The two remaining presidential candidates - Gasim Ibrahim and Abdulla Yameen - have been fighting for the re-run not to take place. Late on Friday, they sought an injunction against the election at the Supreme Court. They complained that they had not had time to endorse the registry of voters - a newly introduced requirement. The court did not issue an injunction but nor did it give a clear instruction for the election to go ahead. On Saturday, electoral commission head Fuwad Thowfeek said police had entered his offices and were stopping officials distributing election materials. Police spokesman Abdulla Nawaz said the election was stopped because the commission did not comply with a court order to have the voters' list endorsed by all candidates. But Mr Thowfeek accused them of exceeding their mandate. "We are very much concerned about what is going on in this country. The Supreme Court decision does not ask police officers to look into the voters' list and check what is there," he told reporters. The cancellation caused alarm among the country's international partners. India's foreign ministry said it was "seriously concerned at attempts to stall the democratic process", while a US embassy official in Sri Lanka said the delay "represents a real threat to democracy in Maldives". UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said he was "deeply dismayed" and called for the democratic process in the Maldives to be allowed to proceed. Commonwealth observers in the country also issued an angry statement denying suggestions by the police that they had sought Commonwealth advice before stopping the election. </body>

      <body>Australia's military is investigating whether a training exercise using explosives may have started one of the huge bush fires burning in the state of New South Wales. The exercise took place at a base near the town of Lithgow in the Blue Mountains region on Wednesday. It was the same day that a massive bush fire - which is still burning - began. About 200 homes have been destroyed in dozens of fires which have been burning for several days. The BBC's Jon Donnison in Sydney says this year's fires have come unusually early after unseasonably hot weather, and many are fearing a long and dangerous summer. One man has died - possibly of a heart attack - while trying to protect his home. The Australian Defence Force issued a statement about the fire burning between Lithgow and Bilpin, some 80 km (50 miles) north-west of Sydney, which is reported to have burned through 30,000 hectares (74,000 acres) and destroyed properties. It said it was investigating the circumstances of the fire, which began on defence land. "The fire started on 16 October, the same day that defence personnel were conducting an explosive ordnance training activity," the statement said. "Defence is investigating if the two events are linked. "Our thoughts are with those who have lost property or whose property is threatened by these devastating fires." Firefighters have been trying to make the most of a relatively cool day to tackle about 20 fires that are burning out of control, but higher temperatures and strong winds are expected to create difficult conditions in the coming days. New South Wales Rural Fire Service Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers said Saturday's conditions were a "pause", but that the fire perimeter stretched for more than 500km. "We're by no means out of the woods," he told broadcaster ABC. "It's just calmed down a little bit and obviously we're bracing ourselves for these worsening conditions." Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said some of the fires were so large they would take some time to completely extinguish. "Firefighters will be working on these fires for weeks," he said. "It's all about reducing the risk of these fires to breach containment lines and run under hotter, drier, windier condition over coming days." Smoke and ash from the wildfires have blanketed the Sydney skyline. Send your pictures and videos to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or text them to 61124 (UK) or +44 7624 800 100 (International).

      <body>A court in Milan has banned Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's former prime minister, from holding public office for two years, following his conviction for tax fraud. However, the ban must be approved by parliament before taking effect. Earlier this month, a cross-party panel of the Italian Senate recommended his expulsion from the chamber. Berlusconi had threatened to topple the coalition government over the issue but backed down during a confidence vote. If he is expelled from the senate, he will lose his parliamentary immunity from prosecution in a string of criminal cases. He will also spend a year under house arrest, or doing community service - his preferred option, according to a request he formally submitted last week. The votes on his expulsion and ban on holding office are expected to take place within the next few weeks. Berlusconi, 77, was convicted over deals his firm Mediaset made to purchase TV rights to US films. He was sentenced to four years in prison, automatically reduced to one under a 2006 pardon act. He was also banned from holding public office for five years. The sentence was upheld in August. </body>

      <title>Spain party treasurer 'sent cash'</title>

      <body>The former treasurer of Spain's ruling Popular Party says he handed thousands of euros in slush fund payments to the party's secretary general. Speaking by video link from jail, Luis Barcenas said he had given two envelopes with 7,500 euros (£6,350; $10,300) to Maria Cospedal in 2008. Ms Cospedal - who is suing Mr Barcenas for defamation - denied the claim. Mr Barcenas is in custody pending trial over corruption claims. The scandal has rocked the party and angered Spaniards. The former treasurer was giving evidence to a court in Toledo on Friday. He claimed he had personally delivered the cash to Ms Cospedal. Mr Barcenas added that the slush fund payments were a PP tradition. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy earlier this year denied the claim. He also said allegations that he had personally received illegal payments were "lies and manipulations". The Barcenas affair sparked widespread anger in Spain, hit by a double-dip recession and high unemployment. In July, clashes erupted between anti-government protesters and police after more than 1,000 people gathered outside the PP headquarters in Madrid, calling on the government to resign. The scandal originated in a 2009 judicial investigation into corrupt payments involving PP members. In January this year, El Pais newspaper published an list it said showed illegal payments to party members that had been signed off by Mr Barcenas. The former party treasurer says he made numerous bonus cash payments to Mr Rajoy and other senior party members out of the slush fund of donations by businesses. In response, they have accused the ex-treasurer of trying to blackmail them. The PP was handed a clear mandate by Spanish voters at the end of 2011 and as a result Mr Rajoy and his party enjoy a clear majority in parliament. The corruption allegations coincide with Spain's worst economic crisis for decades, and have threatened to destabilise government attempts to shore up public finances and bring the recession to an end. </body>

      <body>A commuter train in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, has crashed at the end of the line, leaving at least 80 people injured. The train failed to stop as it arrived at Once station, crashing through the buffers and ending up wedged between the floor and ceiling of the platform. The accident happened at the same station where 51 people were killed in a similar crash last year. The cause of the accident remains unclear. Saturday's crash happened shortly after 07:00 local time (10:00 GMT). The line from Moreno 40km (25 miles) west of Buenos Aires to Once station, operated by the Sarmiento train company, is normally a busy commuter line during the week, and its trains are usually packed with passengers. Security Secretary Sergio Berni said some of those injured on Saturday had been waiting on the platform and were hurt by flying glass as the train's windows shattered. Jorge Ramirez, a chef who got on the train nine stations before the end of the line, told the AP news agency the accident was "a tragedy". "I saw people hurt, shouting, others thrown on the floor. The people in the first wagon ended up piled on top of each other," he said. After the 2012 crash, the authorities revoked a local company's right to operate trains on the line and pledged to make new investments in safety. But commuters complain of frequent delays and bad service, and it is not uncommon to see travellers crammed into trains on their way to work, says the BBC's Ignacio de los Reyes in Buenos Aires. </body>

      <body>A fire in Brazil's largest port has burnt some 180,000 tonnes of raw sugar, damaging six warehouses and pushing international prices to a one-year high. The authorities in the port of Santos said it took six hours to bring the fire under control. The cause of the blaze is still being investigated. Brazil is the world's main sugar exporter, accounting for nearly half of international sales. The terminal affected by the fire belongs to Brazilian sugar giant Copersucar. Four other sugar terminals are operating normally, port authorities said. Analysts say Brazil has enough port capacity to carry on with its usual export levels. "International markets react because they know there will be a temporary drop. But other terminals will certainly make up for the accident," sugar market analyst Plinio Nastari told Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper. Sugar prices in New York future markets went up by 6% when news of the fire broke, dropping later in the day. Port authorities said that the fire began at around 06:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on a conveyor belt taking raw sugar into one of the warehouses. They say this is the biggest fire in the history of the port of Santos, which exported 12.8 million tonnes of sugar in the first eight months of the year. The port is located some 80km (50 miles) from Sao Paulo. It was the gateway for much of Brazil's coffee exports in the 19th and 20th century and also the main point of entry for millions of European immigrants who arrived in Brazil until the 1950s. </body>

      <description>At least 16 Syrian soldiers have been killed in a suicide bombing and fighting that followed in a Damascus suburb, activists say.</description>

      <body>At least 16 Syrian soldiers have been killed in a suicide bombing and fighting that followed in a Damascus suburb, activists say. The blast triggered clashes at a checkpoint near the mainly-Christian area of Jaramana, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. State media blamed "terrorists" for the explosion but did not give details. Earlier, the US urged the Syrian government to allow aid to reach starving civilians in Damascus. Washington said the army's months-long siege left many people in rebel-held areas in desperate need of food, water and medicine. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of activists inside Syria, said the suicide car bombing by the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front triggered heavy fighting at a key checkpoint between Jaramana and the rebel-held town of Mleha. It said rebels fired rockets into Jaramana during the fighting and Syrian fighter jets retaliated by striking nearby opposition-held areas. The report could not be confirmed. The BBC's Jim Muir in neighbouring Lebanon says the use of suicide bombers to open an offensive is a tactic that has been used increasingly by the rebels in recent months. Rebels control much of the countryside around Damascus but Jaramana - a Christian and Druze area mostly loyal to President Bashar al-Assad - is still held by the government. In August a car bomb in the suburb killed 18 people. Syria's embattled President Assad has drawn support from Syria's ethnic and religious minorities, including Christians and members of his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam. The rebel movement is dominated by Sunni Muslims, who are a majority in Syria. In another development, British surgeon David Nott, who volunteered in a hospital in northern Syria for five weeks, has told the BBC he had treated pregnant women deliberately targeted by snipers. "There was definitely a game going on between the snipers," he said. "One day we would receive patients who had purely groin wounds, another day purely chest wounds or purely abdominal wounds. Then another day full-term pregnant ladies were coming in having been shot." He added: "They were definitely targeted in the uterus. The majority of the babies didn't make it." Mr Nott said he wanted the UK government to help open up a humanitarian corridor in Syria to allow aid and aid workers to enter the country safely. In a statement on Friday, US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki called on the Syrian government "to immediately approve relief convoys". She warned that "those who are responsible for atrocities in the Damascus suburbs and across Syria must be identified and held accountable". At least three of Damascus's suburbs - Yarmouk, Eastern Ghouta and Moudamiyah - have been besieged by government forces for several months. The situation has become so desperate that earlier this week Muslim clerics issued a religious ruling allowing people to eat cats, dogs and donkeys just to survive. Those animals are usually considered unfit for human consumption in Islam. More than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria's conflict, now in its third year. It began with popular protests against President Assad before degenerating into civil war. </body>

      <title>Escaped US killers sign on as felons</title>
      <description>Two convicted murderers freed from prison thanks to forged paperwork went to a jail to register as felons days after their release, records show.</description>

      <body>Two convicted murderers freed from prison with forged paperwork dutifully went to a jail to register as felons several days after their release. Florida officials are searching for Joseph Jenkins and Charles Walker, both 34, who were serving life sentences. Prison officials said they will tighten up their early-release policy to ensure there is no repeat of the blunder. The falsified documents were not identified until several weeks after first convict's release. It is not clear who made the bogus release documents, or if the escapes were related. Jenkins walked free on 27 September and registered three days later at a jail in Orange County, Florida, about 300 miles (480km) from the prison where he was serving his sentence. Walker was set free on 8 October from the same prison and registered on 11 October. The two prisoners apparently signed on to keep up the ruse that they had been released early by a judge. Released felons are required to register as they re-enter the public, otherwise a warrant is issued for their arrest. The registration process includes fingerprinting, images of which are uploaded to Florida police records. A deputy at the jail verifies that felons do not have any outstanding warrants, according to jail spokesman Allen Moore. Release documents bearing the forged signature of a sitting judge were processed through standard channels this autumn, officials have said. Authorities received release orders bearing the faked signature of Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry, printed on Ninth Judicial Circuit letterhead. The fabricated documents were processed by the Orange County clerk's office and sent to the Department of Corrections, which co-ordinated the inmates' release from Franklin prison in the city of Carrabelle, in the north of the state. Sheriff's office spokesman Angelo Nieves told reporters: "This shouldn't have happened, but it did, and our concern is to get these individuals into custody." Judge Perry said there were several red flags that should have alerted the court clerk's office or the corrections department, notably, how rare it is for a sentence reduction to come from prosecutors. On Friday, Florida Corrections Secretary Michael Crews said prisons will now verify with judges, not just court clerks, before releasing prisoners early. Authorities have been reviewing other releases based on modified court orders received from Orange County, to ensure no other inmates had been prematurely freed. Jenkins was serving a life sentence for the 1998 shooting death of a father of six during a botched robbery. Walker was sentenced to life in prison for the 1999 shooting death of a 23-year-old man. Walker said he did not mean to kill the man but fired three shots in warning because the man had been bullying him. </body>

      <title>Former US House Speaker Foley dies</title>
      <description>Former Democratic US Speaker of the House of Representatives Tom Foley, credited with reaching across the aisles in a more bipartisan Congress, dies.</description>

      <body>A former US Speaker of the House of Representatives who was credited with reaching across the aisles in a less bitterly divided Congress has died. Tom Foley, 84, died of complications from a stroke on Friday, his wife said. Born and raised in the north-western US state of Washington, the Democrat served in the House for 30 years and was speaker from 1989-1995. "America has lost a legend of the United States Congress," President Barack Obama said in a statement. "Tom's straightforward approach helped him find common ground with members of both parties," Mr Obama said. As speaker, he was an active negotiator in the 1990 budget talks that led to President George HW Bush breaking his pledge to never raise taxes. "Tom never got personal or burned bridges," Mr Bush said on Friday. "We didn't agree on every issue, but on key issues we managed to put the good of the country ahead of politics." Foley also allowed the House to vote on the resolution that approved the 1990 Iraq war, despite his own personal reservations and the objections of many fellow Democrats. "He granted our request for a vote because it was the right thing to do," Bob Michel, the Republican minority leader at the time, said. "He was that kind of leader." But Foley became the first House Speaker to be ousted by voters in his own constituency - as opposed to through a majority change in the chamber or a no-confidence vote from his own party - since the US Civil War. He was defeated by 4,000 votes in November 1994 by Spokane lawyer George Nethercutt, a Republican who supported term limits, which Foley had long fought. That was the year of the so-called Republican revolution led by Newt Gingrich, who became House Speaker in 1995. On Friday, the current House Speaker, John Boehner, called Foley "a model for any speaker or representative". "Tom Foley endeared himself not only to the wheat farmers back home but also colleagues on both sides of the aisle," Mr Boehner said. After leaving the House, Foley served as US ambassador to Japan for four years. </body>

      <body>It is 50 years since John F Kennedy was assassinated. Where were you when you heard the news? Kennedy was sworn in as president in 1961. At 43 he was the country's youngest president and presented himself as a youthful figure for a new generation. On November 22, 1963, Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline were riding slowly in a motorcade through Dallas. At 12:30 the president was hit in the head and throat when three shots were fired at his open-topped car. He was pronounced dead shortly after arrival at Parkland Memorial Hospital. According to the Warren Commission established to investigate the assassination, a lone gunman - Lee Harvey Oswald - killed the president. There has been consistent speculation ever since that Kennedy's death was the result of a conspiracy. The news shocked the nation and the world. British-American journalist Alistair Cooke said he could not remember a time in the previous 30 years when people everywhere were "so quiet, so tired looking" and "so plainly the victims of a huge and bitter disappointment". In his Letter from America, Cooke recalled the promise of the youthful president, saying there was "the sense that we've been cheated… of the promise of what we had begun to call the age of Kennedy".

      <title>Stage revival of film giant Laughton</title>
      <description>The Thick of It star on spin doctors and screen legends</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24580390</url>

      <body>He made his name as an insufferable spin doctor in political satire The Thick of It and a plain-speaking manager in the BBC's Twenty Twelve. Now actor Vincent Franklin is on stage portraying one of Britain's greatest film stars, Charles Laughton. The legend of Charles Laughton has faded in the 50 years since his death, but the actor was among Britain's first Hollywood superstars, a giant of the silver screen from the 1930s onwards. Whether playing Henry VIII - a role that won him an Oscar in 1934 - or Rembrandt, Captain Bligh or Quasimodo, he was regarded by many as the greatest character actor of his age. "I certainly felt very excited about the idea of playing Laughton when I was asked to do it," explains Vincent Franklin. "Then within a week of being asked, when I'd started to read some books, I thought, this is the most arrogant thing I've ever agreed to do. "If somebody said to an actor, 'Do you want to play Laurence Olivier? Do you want to play Gielgud? Do you want to play De Niro?' you'd go, 'No I'm not going to play De Niro. Unless you're as good as De Niro how can you possibly play De Niro?' "But somehow I'd foolishly gone, 'Yeah, I'll play Charles Laughton.'" Laughton was born in the Yorkshire seaside resort of Scarborough and it is in the actor's home town that Franklin is bringing the Laughton legend back to life. A private and insecure person, Laughton never gave interviews. In the play, Franklin attempts to peel back the screen persona to reveal the real man. "He was an extraordinary lost soul," Franklin says. "As a fat, bald, northern actor myself, the idea that you can be an actor is fine. "But the idea that a man who is by his own [admission] an ugly man can become a film star is quite extraordinary. "On the surface of it, he's an extraordinary, successful human being. But on the inside it's a man who struggled with his own religious beliefs, struggled with his sexuality and struggled with self-loathing while at the same time being a true artist." The play, titled Laughton, is at Scarborough's Stephen Joseph Theatre, which was run by Alan Ayckbourn for 37 years. On display in the foyer is a photograph of Laughton, the guest of honour when the building was opened as a cinema in 1936. Franklin, from Bradford, was most recently seen playing Labour whip Michael Cocks in the National Theatre's 1970s political drama This House. But he is most recognisable from his TV roles as the no-nonsense head of contracts Nick Jowett in Olympic spoof Twenty Twelve and the all-nonsense Conservative PR guru Stewart Pearson in The Thick of It. The insufferably smug Pearson likes nothing better than to "imagineer the narrative" or "take a few turns on the ideas carousel". The Thick of It looks to be on indefinite recess now that Peter Capaldi, who played Pearson's expletive-slinging nemesis Malcolm Tucker, has been cast as Doctor Who. Writer Armando Iannucci recently said the show "has quietly been put in its box". "There's room for some specials," Franklin believes. "Whether Malcolm Tucker will be able to come back from Alpha Centauri or wherever he's been taken in the Tardis I don't know, but I hope so. "I regularly meet some people from it and there is a real sense of, 'It would be nice to do one more, wouldn't it?'" Unusually for an actor, Franklin also has a real job - a decade ago, he founded a company called Quietroom, which advises companies and government departments on how to communicate clearly. In that capacity, he is the anti-Stewart Pearson. "We improvise quite a lot of The Thick of It and quite a lot of what I do is the exact opposite of what I would tell someone to do [at Quietroom]," he says. For someone who advises people how to communicate, Franklin is suitably conscious of his choice of words as an interviewee. At one point he warns, "I'm just going to ramble for a moment now" and regularly checks: "Does that make sense?" When Quietroom works for the government, there are some startled reactions when Franklin pops up in Whitehall between acting jobs, he says. "Between the last government and this one, I went in to do an audit of the language the Treasury was using in things like the Budget and their website," the actor says. "I had my Stewart Pearson beard on - because that's my beard - and I do get very strange looks from people walking around the Treasury or HMRC [Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs] from people going, 'Satan lives!' "What's great about this show is that its biggest fans are people who work in government. Real MPs do want to come and have their picture taken with you, which always seems really bizarre to me." Back in Scarborough, Franklin praises Laughton's writer, the author and geologist Roger Osborne, for his use of language. "So much of what we do in life is about reading stuff and understanding what lies behind it," he says. "Does that make sense? Whether that's us buying an insurance project or playing Charles Laughton. So choosing the right words is really important." Laughton is at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough until 26 October. </body>

      <title>Are markets 'efficient' or irrational?</title>
      <description>The joint Nobel winners who fundamentally disagree</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24579616</url>

      <body>Two economists with diametrically opposing interpretations of the way markets behave have been jointly awarded the 2013 Nobel memorial prize for economics. Why? This story begins way back at the start of the 20th Century, in Paris. Louis Bachelier, aspiring physicist, lives a life filled with misfortune. His parents die suddenly, leaving him holding his baby brother. He's not free to enter university until he's too old to be admitted. He takes night classes instead, producing one of Einstein's famous results before Einstein does - and he's all but laughed out of academia. But in 1900, Bachelier publishes work that, long after his death, will be recognised as ground-breaking. His remarkable idea is that the price of government bonds follow a random course - each new movement in the price will be unpredictable. At first sight it's an odd idea. Why would the performance of a financial asset be random? But Bachelier understood that if it was obvious that a share or a bond would be worth more next week, then the price should already have risen in anticipation of that. Predictable moves have already happened, because the market is efficient - and all that is left are unpredictable surprises. In the economics department of the University of Chicago in the 1960s, student Eugene Fama knew Louis Bachelier's theory well, but wasn't satisfied. "It dawned on me that that statement wasn't enough," he says. "There's no economical model behind that." And so Fama went to work, and ended up demonstrating that stock markets are indeed efficient. If you are an investor, one important consequence of an efficient market is that there's no point trying to make a killing. The market will always be one step ahead of you. Better to invest broadly rather than believing in some get-rich-quick scheme. Fama himself has, in fact, found some ways to beat the market - or at least, investment strategies that would have beaten the market in the past. But he concludes nonetheless that for practical investment purposes, people might as well behave as though markets are efficient, and that nothing is therefore underpriced. "Because if they are inefficient it's very difficult to tell how, when and where, and the evidence suggests that supposed experts aren't very good at it," he says. "People spend lots of money trying to hire managers that can pick stocks, although the evidence says quite conclusively that that is probably impossible to do." So the market is always right. Or is it? A decade later, a challenger to the efficient markets hypothesis arrives on the scene - Robert Shiller, now at Yale, then at MIT. He wrote a paper making a statistical case that market volatility is too high for the efficient markets theory to be true. His idea was that markets have a tendency to overreact to news, or to react to non-news. "This got me into a huge controversy then," he recalls. "I was wondering why do people get so emotional about this? I'm just saying something that's common sense and obvious - these markets aren't perfect." And this argument doesn't stay in academic circles. It makes it into the heart of real world economics. In 1996 Robert Shiller is invited to lunch with the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan. "I asked the table, 'When was the last time a Fed chairman had said that he thought that the stock market was overpriced?'" The answer came that it was about 30 years ago. "So I said to Greenspan, 'Maybe you ought to consider making a statement about the overpricing of the market?'" Just a few days later the Federal Reserve Chairman made a speech that has become famous. "How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in Japan over the past decade?" he said. Having prodded Alan Greenspan into action, Shiller went on to write a best-selling book called Irrational Exuberance, and he's famous for saying in the late 1990s that shares were hugely overvalued - and they did crash not long after - and for saying in 2005 that US house prices were overvalued. And they crashed too. Was he just lucky? What were his reasons for pointing to a bubble? Well, stock analysts commonly looked at how company profits, or earnings, compared to their share price. What Shiller and his colleague John Campbell had decided to do was take a longer-term view of this price-earnings ratio. They compared the share price to the average earnings for the past 10 years. This long-term price-earnings ratio showed a sharp peak in 1929, just before the great Wall Street crash. And the peak in the late 1990s was even bigger. So why don't we see these irrational booms at the time? "I think it's because a lot of people benefit by seeing the boom continue," Shiller says. "And there's a sense that no-one should shout 'Fire!' in a crowded theatre - everything's going great, right? Earnings are going up, prices are going up." But Eugene Fama isn't convinced that it's quite so easy to spot trouble in financial markets. "The notion that for example regulators should somehow go in and burst bubbles is to me a joke," he says. "I don't think anybody really recognises bubbles - I mean I don't even like the word - apart from in 20/20 hindsight." In Gene Fama's view, when technology stocks boomed in the late 1990s, and then crashed, that reflected people's views about the prospects of highly successful companies emerging from the melee. Not quite enough of them did, to sustain share prices at that level. But that didn't make the market irrational, it just made it wrong - with hindsight. We shouldn't overlook Lars Peter Hansen. He was the third Nobel prize winner, for developing statistical tools that are now hugely influential in economics - especially in the study of financial markets. But we wouldn't be human if we weren't curious about the apparent contradiction in awarding shares of the Nobel prize to Eugene Fama for showing that the market is efficient, and Robert Shiller for showing that it isn't. Is the committee just hedging its bets? Both will get a mention in the history books as having contributed to the future development of economic thought, in Shiller's view. "It's a little bit like religion," he says. "I mean there are all these different sects and if you look at them in the whole it doesn't seem to make any sense - they contradict each other so fundamentally. But maybe there's some wisdom about living that comes out of all of them. And I think that the economics profession isn't as fragmented as it may seem." But was it not a little irritating to share the Nobel memorial prize with someone who seems to contradict you? "I think there is rule for substantial disagreement and I think all points of view - all interpretations of the evidence - should get a full airing," Fama says. "I mean, all of that makes the world a much more interesting place, and I was thrilled that Bob got it." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Peek-a-boo: A window on baby's brain</title>
      <description>The secrets revealed by babies' laughter</description>

      <body>A baby's first smile is an exciting moment. But what can it tell us about their understanding of the world? Boasting about the speed of childhood development is the sport of choice for many a doting parent. From the 12-week scan right through the early years, monitoring the physical and mental progress of their pride and joy is a source of both excitement and concern. Especially rewarding is the onset of smiles, squeals and laughter - the kind of milestones that make all the disturbed nights worth it. But is it all just wind? Apparently not, as researchers now think that laughter and games like peek-a-boo could be telling us something more, and giving us a way to peer inside the workings of their minds. "Laughter and smiles start incredibly early, just like tears," says Dr Caspar Addyman, a baby laughter researcher at Birkbeck College in London. "So this leads us to think that it's a form of communication," he told the BBC. Dr Addyman has collected nearly 700 questionnaires about baby smiles and laughter from around the world. He found that babies are smiling in response to pleasant feelings much earlier than expected, which can be as young as one month old. Soon after that, at between two to four months, social smiles develop that are used specifically to engage the parents. He now hopes to take the research further and use laughter as a new way of tracking what it is that babies understand about the world around them. The person who most greatly influenced our current view of childhood development was Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Careful observations of children at different ages led him to identify four stages that everyone must go through to reach the cognitive abilities of an adult (see box). In the earliest months of life, Piaget said that babies are only able to learn about the world by directly interacting with it through grasping, shaking and sucking. With each experience, he concluded, children gradually build up a picture of how the world works - a kind of naïve physics. But Dr Addyman thinks that studying babies' laughter can be just as effective at helping us pinpoint developments in the way their minds are expanding. "You can't laugh at something until you get the joke, so what they laugh at really tells us about their understanding of the world," says Addyman. As a result of having experienced so little, small children are for the most part quite content to accept the absurd as completely plausible. Dr Addyman, who sports a crop of bright blue hair, sees this regularly with his young volunteers. "Young babies would never laugh at my hair. But older children realise there's something wrong and that makes it funny." The ability of children to suddenly see the funny side, Dr Addyman believes, acts to highlight much more profound developments going on deep inside their brains. The Baby Laughter Project, which has surveyed parents from more than 20 countries, has shown that games like peek-a-boo are perfect for showing one such fundamental development - object permanence. The term describes the understanding that an object still exists, even if you can't see it. Very young children don't know this, which is why babies under around six months can look shocked and startled at peek-a-boo. They think that not being able to see mum or dad's face means that they've actually disappeared, making their sudden reappearance comes as quite a surprise. However once a child understands (at around six- to eight-months old) that their parent is just hiding, then peek-a-boo becomes all about the anticipation of when they're going to come back. "Peek a boo is all the best things. It's mummy reappearing, but it's also about shared communication," says Dr Addyman. "You can't help but smile and laugh when a baby starts laughing with you, which is really valuable for them developing their ability to interact with other people." A potential link between laughter and language development suggests we've thus far underestimated babies' sense of humour. Joking requires an element of taking turns as well as other skills needed for advanced interaction, like imitation and eye-contact. "Children can pick up the rhythms of conversation through joking and playing games," says Dr Addyman. In fact, smiles and laughter could be important communication tools for infants before they develop language. Even primates seem to use laughter as a way of regulating social interaction. "Laughter in chimps is predominantly used in play and it tends to be the youngest members of the group who have time for playing," says Dr Katie Slocombe, a primate cognition specialist at the University of York. "It's been shown in chimps that laughter facilitates extended play, and we can't rule out that it has some sort of role in social bonding. When a chimp laughs, it seems to encourage their play partner to continue tickling or chasing them - just like a baby keeping an adult's attention for longer," she told the BBC. So should we try harder to interpret the deeper meaning in those burbles and titters? Dr Addyman suggests a certain level of caution. "Historically, we've certainly been guilty of projecting adult interpretations about what babies are laughing at, and it's a constant danger when doing this kind of research," he says. "You really have to look at this scientifically and at a range of ages to really start to understand what's going on in their heads." </body>

      <title>Making the case for 'Yes'</title>
      <description>Alex Salmond's speech was droll and pragmatic, says Brian Taylor</description>

      <body>Alex Salmond may have lost a few pounds (he is apparently on the same diet as Beyonce.) However, our newly svelte FM has plainly lost none of his comic timing. The gags themselves were modestly droll but the delivery was impeccable. Admittedly, it was scarcely a tough house. No sense here of the Glasgow Empire on a wet Thursday. They were ready to laugh, they were ready to applaud, they were more than ready to cheer. And they duly did all three. There was, of course, substance too: not least the date on which the White Paper will emerge. This document will form the prospectus upon which people in Scotland will be voting (although, as the UK government points out, independence would require negotiation beyond a Yes vote, plus a Bill through Westminster.) Along with the publication date, we learned a little more about that White Paper. It will have two sections.... Mr Salmond said the aim would be to create both a prosperous country and a just society. And certainly he stressed the importance of enterprise, the need to compete globally. But the substance of his address was weighted towards egalitarianism. For example, the major announcement was about potentially enhancing the minimum wage. In part, this matches the Scottish mood which is traditionally more communitarian. But there is a pragmatic purpose too. For Alex Salmond to secure a Yes vote in the referendum, he needs to recruit votes from the dispossessed and struggling, from Labour voters and those disenchanted with politics entirely. Hence this pitch. On which, one might note the debate earlier today in which delegates agreed to examine the economic proposals contained in the Common Weal paper published by the Jimmy Reid Foundation. The resolution as amended noted that an independent Scotland "may wish to adopt" these proposals. As with other resolutions, this was carried by acclaim. I gather that there had been an expectation that someone would challenge this, suggesting at the very least that the resolution might be remitted. The advice, apparently, was that this would simply provoke division - and draw more attention to the issue than was thought to be warranted. To be clear - and this was stressed by speakers in the debate - the Common Weal prospectus is not SNP policy. However, examination of its content with a view to possible adoption is now a declared party objective. Those who are interested can read the full detail on the Foundation's own website. But, in essence, it argues for a Nordic approach to the economy and social policy: including an emphasis upon equality, the prospect of public ownership where justified and a higher percentage of GDP taken in tax (although it is noted further that wages overall might be higher, resulting in a net gain in living standards.) When I interviewed Angus Robertson for our conference webcast, he was keen to talk about Nordic egalitarianism but preferred to emphasise economic growth rather than higher taxation. Memories perhaps of a "Penny for Scotland", the previous SNP proposal to use Holyrood's Tartan Tax power which failed to enthuse the electorate. More of which later as the White Paper emerges. Back to Alex Salmond's speech. This was a potent performance by an experienced politician on form. It was well timed. Well structured. It featured the now familiar syllogism: Holyrood has produced devolved policies in tune with Scotland; by contrast, Westminster generates policies out of synch with Scottish thinking; turn to full independence. Mr Salmond's opponents, of course, say that is logically fallacious. That there is no automatic read-through from devolution to independence, that the Union remains valid and valuable. On to the White Paper. On to the referendum. </body>

      <title>Going nuclear: UK's deal with China</title>
      <description>Should UK worry about China nuclear investment?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-24575430</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70555000/jpg/_70555592_70555589.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Perched high on top of one of the giant new reactor buildings under construction at Taishan we had a view over the entire site. It's one of the biggest nuclear plants of its kind in the world: six reactors being built on the edge of the South China Sea. In front of us construction cranes encircled the egg-like shape of another huge, grey concrete reactor shell. They swung lazily back and forth. Teams of workers were welding metal bars in place. Everything looked incredibly orderly. George Osborne, the UK chancellor, looked impressed. Mr Osborne had just announced that he will welcome Chinese participation in building nuclear power stations in Britain. Mr Osborne's host, Zhang Shan Ming, the general manager of the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN), obviously keen to stress the safety features of the reactor, was explaining why the concrete casing was so thick. "It's against air traffic crash," Mr Zhang said. "Right," the UK chancellor replied. "Special safety procedures." "An earthquake, or tsunami, or typhoon, you are prepared for that?" Mr Osborne asked. "The design is prepared for this," he was told. Britain's chancellor seemed reassured, as he needs to be, given that a near replica of Taishan is now likely to be built at Hinkley Point in Somerset in the UK at a cost of around £14 billion ($22bn) by a similar consortium to that working in China. Taishan uses European-designed reactors built by a partnership between the French firm EDF and China's CGN. It's one of almost 30 new nuclear power plants China is building or planning to build. China has not had any major accidents at its nuclear power stations, and says its safety record is good. But there are concerns that, in the dash to build so many new reactors, and use indigenous Chinese technology in some, safety could be compromised. Just down the coast from Taishan lies Hong Kong, where environmental groups enjoy far more freedom than they would have in China. They say there are reasons the UK should be cautious about partnering with China's nuclear operators. "My first concern would be the lack of transparency," says Prentice Koo, senior campaigner at Greenpeace. "Their track record is really bad. For every incident in a nuclear power plant in China, they only provide a very brief report, and all it says is how they solved the problem," he says. "They never give the reason for the incident." His second concern is whether Chinese companies would actually pay up if they were found liable for any incident that happened to a reactor they had built overseas. "The nuclear industry in China enjoys such a privileged position that they have to pay only very limited sums in compensation if there is any major incident," explains Mr Koo. "Overseas they'll be required to pay a lot more... it'll test the ability of China's nuclear industry to pay up." At Taishan, though, they were keen to point out not only their safety features, but also how transparent they are. Dong Shi Ming, a public relations officer, said it was so open that members of the public could come and visit the site - all they had to do was apply for an organised tour. He claimed thousands had already done so. Is China's nuclear industry safe or not? Is it really transparent? They're important questions. Involvement in the UK will test China's firms. It may even force them to be more transparent. The only other place where China has built reactors so far is in Pakistan. Some in the West will be deeply uncomfortable at the prospect of Chinese state-owned firms being involved in the building and running of UK nuclear plants. After all, China remains an authoritarian state, its nuclear firms answerable, ultimately to the Communist Party. For now they are to be minority players in the UK. But one day they may have control over some of Britain's strategic energy supplies. Others, like George Osborne, see a great opportunity. As one member of the British delegation explained to me, deeper commercial engagement will give China a bigger stake in Britain's success. Britain's goodwill in opening up to Chinese firms could engender better ties and reciprocal opportunities for British firms in China's nuclear industry. The UK is already a major investor in China through oil firms like Shell and BP. Getting China to invest more in the UK makes the relationship more balanced, the argument goes. China now has stakes in Britain's oil and gas industries; nuclear opens a major new area to it. Some of this boils down to long-running arguments: Is it better to engage China or to be cautious? Is it wise to draw it into a deeper relationship with the outside world or be wary of the intentions of its opaque Communist rulers? At Taishan George Osborne has taken a big, some might worry risky, step: he's gone nuclear. </body>

      <body>Roads and shops have been closed as flash flooding caused chaos around Cardiff on Saturday afternoon following heavy rain. Areas affected included Pentrebane, Llandaff, Roath, Cathays and parts of north Cardiff. Police were forced to close roads in Ely and Culverhouse Cross as localised flooding made conditions treacherous. At least six fire engines were dealing with separate incidents across the city at one point. South Wales Police said traffic was at a standstill around the Culverhouse Cross shopping area and warned people to keep away. A spokesperson said officers were closing the road leading to Marks and Spencer and Tesco at Culverhouse Cross after both shops had been affected by the rain. Water was reported to be getting into both stores forcing people to be evacuated. There were also said to be several flooding incidents in Ely, including one at a private property, and Mill Road was closed. Eluned Haf, of Southerndown in the Vale of Glamorgan, said she was stuck for two hours in the Marks and Spencer car park after the shop was evacuated. "I was taking the kids off to my mam at Culverhouse Cross and the rain came down," she said. "I got into the MandS car park and thought 'thank God for that'. I went to hand the kids to my mam and the whole building was evacuated. "I was stuck in the car park for two hours." She said there was gridlock on the roads in the area as the nearby Tesco was also evacuated. </body>

      <body>A service has taken place to mark the first anniversary of a mother's death in a series of hit-and-runs in Cardiff. Karina Menzies, 31, was killed outside Ely fire station while on a school run with two of her three children. Matthew Tvrdon, 32, who has paranoid schizophrenia, drove on an eight-mile "journey of mayhem" killing Ms Menzies and injuring 17 others. He admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was detained under the Mental Health Act. He also admitted seven counts of attempted murder and other charges including three counts of grievous bodily harm with intent. A memorial party was held on Friday evening by Ms Menzies' sister Samantha who is bringing up her three nieces Sophie, 12, Ellie, nine, and Tiana, four. And a church service was held on Saturday at Ely's Church of the Resurrection before the family held a private memorial where lanterns and fireworks will be released. The church became a focus for the community in the aftermath of the tragedy. "The year has been absolutely crazy," said 27-year-old Samantha. "My partner Lee and I are just run off our feet but we wouldn't have it any other way. "The girls are doing well and doing well in school. They obviously have their moments though. "The memorial party was a way for me to thank people for what they've done for the family and to thank the community." Terror was brought to west Cardiff for 30 minutes in October last year when Tvrdon was said in court to have used his van as a "weapon". Adults and children were injured in collisions in Ely and nearby Leckwith as he knocked people over like "skittles". In the most serious incident he targeted Ms Menzies as she walked on the forecourt of Ely fire station with two of her children, Ellie and Tiana. Sophie was on holiday in Florida at the time. She pushed her children out of the way before the van hit her. Tvrdon was told he would be released from Ashworth maximum security hospital in Merseyside only if a mental health tribunal was satisfied he should be released. The Reverend Jan Gould, priest-in-charge at the Church of the Resurrection, said: "The tragedy devastated our community last year and I think it's important that we mark this first anniversary. "Some of the victims were in hospital last year and so were unable to attend the service we had on the weekend it all happened. "They have said they would like an opportunity to attend something in church as a way of helping them to 'move on'. "I hope this service will give the community the opportunity to come together again and show their support for those whose lives were completely turned upside down a year ago in that dreadful incident." </body>

      <title>Rebates 'swallow up' tax increases</title>
      <description>Rebates will swallow up as much as a third of money from council tax increases next year, leading local government figures have said.</description>

      <body>Up to a third of money from council tax increases next year will be swallowed up by rebates, the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) has said. The Welsh government has not increased council tax benefit funding next year. It means councils will pay the increased cost of benefit for all recipients in their area as bills rise. UK ministers devolved council tax benefit to Wales last year with a 10% funding gap, and it has been the centre of political controversy ever since. WLGA resources director Jon Rae told the assembly's finance committee: "With the new council tax reduction scheme, local authorities essentially have to swallow their own smoke on any council tax increases. "So there's a brake on the ability to raise additional income from council tax of about a quarter to a third of the increase which will have to go on funding the council tax reduction scheme." Torfaen council cabinet member Anthony Hunt said: "It used to be that we could depend on a percentage raise in council tax raising us about £300,000 in Torfaen. "Now it's nearer £200,000 because of the impact of the council tax reduction scheme. "So if you compare that figure to the savings we need to make - it's very small." The Welsh government announced earlier in the week that it would continue to make up a shortfall in council tax benefit funding of around £22m next year. But that does not take into account the cost to the scheme of funding any increases in council tax next year. On Wednesday Local Government Minister Lesley Griffiths said she expected council tax bills to go up next year but she refused to speculate how much. The WLGA has been using an estimate of a 3.5% rise in its financial projections which would add around £40 to the average band D bill. Early modelling as a result of the draft budget indicated a shortfall of between £400m and £440m for local government over the next two years, the finance committee was told. Members were told councils had begun drawing down reserves last year for the first time since 1999. Mr Rae said about £30m had been taken out, but warned that use of reserves to plug funding gaps was not a realistic option as the current total reserves held by all councils in Wales amounted to about ten days' expenditure. "Sometimes many out there think that underneath county hall there is a great big pot of gold, and there isn't," he said. Witnesses from local government said they had not been given sufficient warning of the scale of next year's cuts. They said that as late as June this year they were still working on the basis of an average increase of 0.5% for councils next year. Mr Rae said they had then been told there were "English-style cuts" on the way but said they needed firmer figures for planning purposes. The draft budget will actually result in a cut of 3.5% to council budgets for 2014/15. </body>

      <title>Cardiff Blues 19-15 Toulon</title>
      <description>Replacement Gareth Davies' late try gives Cardiff Blues a dramatic win against Heineken Cup holders Toulon at the Arms Park.</description>

      <body>A late try by replacement Gareth Davies gave Cardiff Blues a dramatic win over Heineken Cup holders Toulon at the Arms Park. Rhys Patchell and Leigh Halfpenny's first-half kicking duel with Jonny Wilkinson ended level at 6-6. Wilkinson kicked three more penalties after the break with Halfpenny twice responding for the hosts. But Davies broke free from a tackle to score two minutes from the end and Halfpenny converted. Having conceded five first-half tries in defeat at Exeter Chiefs in their opening game, director of rugby Phil Davies had demanded a telling response from his players. The hosts earned a bonus point for their four-tries second-half effort at Exeter and Davies hoped they would maintain that momentum against the wealthy French club. But few could have expected the Blues to give Phil Davies such a memorable 50th birthday present as they toppled the star-studded French Top 14 team. The Blues also had to contend with a late change when skipper and hooker Matthew Rees was ruled out by illness and Wales and Lions wing Alex Cuthbert failing to come out for the second period after suffering a leg injury. Marc Breeze came into the starting line-up while ex-Toulon prop Gethin Jenkins took over the captaincy. The visitors found the Blues' defence as impenetrable as it had been porous at Sandy Park in the opening round. In midweek the Welsh region parted company with defence coach Rob Powell and announced Pontypridd head coach Dale McIntosh as his replacement. McIntosh - known affectionately as The Chief - was at Sardis Road to end 24 years of playing and coaching as they took on London Welsh in the British and Irish Cup. But he will have been heartened to learn of the Blues' defensive effort, particularly in the dying moments as Toulon tried and failed to hit back. Toulon comfortably saw off Pro12 leaders Glasgow as their title defence opened and their early, attack-minded approach seemed to indicate they were confident of a similar effort in the Welsh capital. But the Blues rose to the criticism that followed their defeat at Exeter to regain respect in Europe in conditions that began in drizzle, continued in a deluge and ended in autumn sunshine. The hosts' pack may not have matched their much-vaunted opponents at the scrum and Toulon's physical superiority was often evident at the breakdowns. But the Blues' line-out was solid and while fly-half Patchell occasionally lost concentration, his tactical kicking was impressive. A fourth-minute long-range Patchell penalty began the duel in which Wilkinson's penalty brace took his side ahead. Halfpenny levelled after lock Bakkies Botha's forearm challenge on Josh Navidi at a ruck and the teams were tied 6-6 at the break. Wilkinson added two more penalties early in the second period, but missed two more chances before Halfpenny brought the hosts level. Former England and Lions fly-half Wilkinson kicked his side ahead with a fifth shot from a narrow angle with eight minutes remaining. But after Cory Allen's break took the Blues deep into Toulon's 22, Sam Warburton maintained the momentum with his own surge. Davies, who had replaced Patchell as Wilkinson kicked his final penalty, went on an arcing run and after not being held in a tackle by Toulon's desperate defence, bounced off the synthetic surface to score. Halfpenny added the conversion and Toulon's frantic efforts to hit back were thwarted. Cardiff Blues: Leigh Halfpenny; Alex Cuthbert, Owen Williams, Cory Allen, Harry Robinson; Rhys Patchell, Lloyd Williams; Gethin Jenkins (capt), Marc Breeze, Scott Andrews, Bradley Davies, Filo Paulo, Josh Navidi, Sam Warburton, Robin Copeland. Replacements: Richard Smith for Cuthbert (41), Gareth Davies for Patchell (72), Benoit Bourrust for Andrews (59), Lou Reed for Paulo (75).

      <title>HS2 will benefit UK, says minister</title>
      <description>Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin says the HS2 project will benefit the whole UK, after figures suggested some areas including Cardiff would be worse off.</description>

      <body>The HS2 high-speed rail project will bring benefits to the whole UK, the transport secretary has said. Patrick McLoughlin was speaking after details of the potential losses that HS2 could cause in about 50 regional economies as calculated by consultants KPMG were revealed by BBC Newsnight. Some of the "losing" areas would benefit from other planned rail improvements, Mr McLoughlin said. He said the project "was controversial, but it was the right thing to do". Speaking to the BBC, Mr McLoughlin said he wanted to see every part of the UK benefit from HS2. "All these investments that we are looking at is to serve the people of the UK, to make the UK a place where we attract investment," he said. "It's of no doubt to me that it's beneficial to the UK. We need to make sure our cities in the north are able to compete with the rest of Europe as well. "HS2 is vitally important overall for the long-term future of the economy." The KPMG report, which was released in September, said the line could boost the UK economy by £15bn a year and listed the regions it said would benefit, with Greater London and West Midlands the biggest winners. But although it included maps showing which areas not on the route could potentially be worse off, it did not include details of the scale of possible losses. KPMG's findings have now been released in a freedom of information request passed to BBC Two's Newsnight programme. According to the research economic output would be worst affected: HS2 Ltd's chief executive has called them "unsurprising". But James Bream, policy director of Aberdeen's Chamber of Commerce, said it was "really disappointing" that such a huge number was left out of the original report. He added the negative impact for the whole north-east of Scotland could be "significant to say the least." Richard Houghton, from campaign group HS2 Action Alliance, claimed the whole project is based on "voodoo economics". He said: "If I was sitting in one of the 50 areas set to lose out to the tune of millions of pounds, I would be asking very clear questions." The chief executive of HS2 Ltd, Alison Munro, said: "What this is showing is that the places that are on the high-speed network... those are the places that will benefit most from high-speed two. "But high-speed two isn't the only investment that the government is making. Over the next five years it is planning to spend £73bn on transport infrastructure." </body>

      <body>A farmer who allowed over 80,000 tonnes of waste to be dumped illegally in a disused reservoir has been handed a 10-month suspended sentence. Paul Morris, 47, of Ebbw Vale, Blaenau Gwent, was paid over £280,000 for running the illegal landfill site from March 2006 to July 2010 on his farm. He denied allowing the waste to be dumped but was found guilty last month. He was sentenced at Newport Crown Court on Friday where a judge said he was "appalled" at Morris's actions. Morris was also ordered to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work. The court heard that officers from the Environment Agency visited Carreg Bica Isaf Farm in August 2010 after neighbours complained about a strong smell. The officers found decomposing waste and a dark-coloured run-off, known as leachate, escaping into nearby woodland. Samples taken from the farm land in September 2010 revealed ammonia levels were as high as those found in raw sewage, the court was told. More than 20 companies who tipped waste at the site were investigated by an environmental crime team. Christian Jowett, prosecuting, said Morris claimed much of the 80,000 tonnes was inert material which would not have caused environmental damage, but it should not have been there at all because Morris did not have an appropriate licence. Sentencing Morris, Judge Rhys Rowlands said: "You allowed a great deal of waste to be deposited on your land. In the process of doing so you or an employee would cover it to hide its true nature." He added the offences were "deliberate, persistent and done for profit". "The offences only came to light when woodland became contaminated. Up until then you were able to get away with it by covering it with inert material," added the judge. "Undoubtedly you created a problem and that will remain for some years. Our environment is a precious commodity. I'm appalled at what you were doing." Judge Rowlands said it was a "serious example of sustained environmental crime" and there had to be consequences to deter others from doing the same. Gregg Taylor QC, defending Morris, said his client believed that after applying for planning permission he was able to dump waste in the disused reservoir on his land. "The amount of contaminated waste is but a small part. The vast majority of the waste was not hazardous," said Mr Taylor. He said Morris had performed "considerable work" to keep the pollution within the boundaries of his land and he had the knowledge and machinery to help the authorities monitor ammonia levels in future. Following the court hearing, Gareth O'Shea of Natural Resources Wales, said: "We hope the outcome of this case will send out a positive message to those in the waste industry, that Natural Resources Wales will not tolerate those who seek to profit by breaking the law, harming local communities or damaging the environment. "The motivation behind the crime was financial. The site did not have the necessary permissions and consequently the infrastructure to protect the environment and it undercut legitimate permitted sites." </body>

      <body>Plaid Cymru's parliamentary leader Elfyn Llwyd has announced he is stepping down as MP for Dwyfor Meirionnydd at the 2015 election. Mr Llwyd, who has served in Westminster for 21 years, said it had been the highest honour to serve his constituency, party and nation. He said the time had come to turn his hand to other work and other interests. Mr Llwyd played a lead role in the campaign which brought about two new offences of stalking last year. Plaid Cymru said the MP had also been a tireless advocate of veterans' rights and was one of the leaders of the campaign to impeach Tony Blair in the wake of the Iraq war. The party added that Mr Llwyd had made a huge contribution to devolution and the constitutional future of Wales. Mr Llwyd said: "I have decided not to put my name forward to seek re-nomination for the 2015 general election. "I am hugely grateful to the people of Dwyfor Meirionnydd and Nant Conwy for their support and loyalty over the years. "It has been the highest honour to serve my constituency, party and nation, but the time has come to turn my hand to other work and pursue other interests that I have. "Playing a role in such an exciting period in the history of Wales and Plaid Cymru has been an absolute privilege. "I have every confidence that the party will go from strength to strength and will continue to put the interests of the people and communities of Wales above all else." </body>

      <title>Bid for loans to help deprived areas</title>
      <description>Ministers hold talks with the European Investment Bank to see if loans can help unlock £2.1bn of EU aid for some of Wales' most deprived communities.</description>

      <body>Ministers have held talks with the European Investment Bank (EIB) to see if loans can be secured to boost some of Wales' most deprived communities. West Wales and the valleys qualifies for £2.1bn of new EU aid that must be matched by public or private cash. Projects in the region qualify for the money due to its poor economic performance. Ministers have said Wales must not "sit back and wait" before using the money, despite public spending cuts. But a leading academic has warned Wales risks being "left behind" as other traditionally poorer areas of Europe see far higher growth levels. Finance Minister Jane Hutt told BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme the EIB was "looking at ways they can help us, until we get our borrowing powers, in perhaps different ways to fund projects". "This is not a time to sit back and wait - we have to get on with the job, and the European Investment Bank is very keen to work with us on this," she said. The west Wales and the valleys area comprises Anglesey, Conwy, Denbighshire, Gwynedd, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire, Swansea, Neath Port Talbot, Bridgend, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Merthyr Tydfil, Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly and Torfaen. One scheme that could receive EIB loans is the South Wales Metro, an ambitious blueprint to link train and bus service across Cardiff and the valleys. Mrs Hutt has already announced £62m will come from the Welsh government for the project. The EU money is available from 2014-2020. West Wales and the valleys received around £1.9bn in 2007-13, and a similar figure in the previous seven years. Mrs Hutt denied the money had failed to have an impact. She said: "This is about transport links, it's about regeneration, it's about helping businesses with research and development. "You can give all the numbers but these young people who have had training, does it lead to jobs? That's the important test really of how we've used our (EU) funding and it has led to these young people getting jobs." But statistics collected by the EU suggested other areas had seen higher levels of economic growth after receiving similar funding to west Wales and the valleys. Dr Adrian Healy, from Cardiff University's School of Planning and Geography, told the programme: "Previous places which have had low GDP growth, low employment, productivity value similar to Wales - and west Wales and the valleys in particular - are seeing higher levels of growth and higher rates of growth over the last five, seven, 10 years and that puts west Wales and the valleys in a particularly difficult situation. "We have a low level of activity, and it's not getting much better in comparison to those other areas that might have been seen as being similar. There is a risk of being left behind, in that sense." The Conservative Aberconwy MP Guto Bebb said the money invested so far had not transformed the Welsh economy as hoped. "If you travel the length and breadth of Wales you will find examples of waste within European structural funds which should really make us feel very ashamed," he said. "You will find arts centres which have closed, cultural centres which have closed - all this investment in buildings which look very impressive but no funding in place to keep them running. "And rather than create an entrepreneurial spirit, European funding has actually contributed to the dependency culture we have as a country." Sunday Politics Wales is on BBC One Wales at 11:00 BST on Sunday, 20 October. </body>

      <body>British conductor Michael Francis will be joining the BBC National Orchestra of Wales when it tours mid and north Wales next month. The orchestra will visit Aberystwyth, Bangor and Llandudno on three consecutive dates in November. Francis is making his return to Wales for the tour having previously studied music at Cardiff University. He joined the London Symphony Orchestra as a double bassist, but turned to conducting after an emergency call up. He replaced Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, who had to miss a rehearsal due to a flight delay, and has since opted to continue conducting. The concerts feature cellist Daniel Muller-Schott, who will perform Dvorak's Cello Concerto, while Tchaikovsky's Symphony No 6 Pathetique will also be performed. They will take place at Aberystwyth Arts Centre, Aberystwyth (8 November, 19:30 GMT); Pritchard-Jones Hall, Bangor University (9 November, 19:30) and Venue Cymru, Llandudno (10 November, 15:00). </body>

      <title>Fund under investigation is wound up</title>
      <description>A regeneration fund which is at the centre of an investigation by the Wales Audit Office is wound up by the Welsh government.</description>

      <body>A regeneration fund which is at the centre of an investigation by the Wales Audit Office has been wound up by the Welsh government. Auditors are looking into the sale of 16 parcels of publicly-owned land that were sold for about £20m by the Regeneration Investment Fund for Wales. There are concerns they could have generated much more for the taxpayer. The investigation is focusing on the decision to sell the sites privately rather than by a public auction. This week South Wales Police also said it was considering whether or not an investigation into the sale of land by Regeneration Investment Fund for Wales (RIFW) was required. In a statement, Housing Minister Carl Sargeant said after consultation he was going to draw the investment activities of the fund to a close. He also said the effectiveness of the fund had been seriously damaged by the cumulative impact of investigations and that closing the fund would free up money to be invested in other areas. In March last year the parcels of land, situated across Wales, were sold to a Guernsey-based firm called South Wales Land Developments. Instead of there being an open tendering process, 18 property agents and developers were approached and the sites were bundled together in one portfolio rather than sold individually. The Wales Audit Office (WAO) began an investigation last year. WAO director Mike Usher said: "Welsh government officials have kept the Wales Audit Office informed of developments. "It remains the auditor general's intention to publish the results of his value for money study of the Regeneration Investment Fund for Wales before the end of the calendar year. "As our audit work is ongoing, we are not able to comment more fully at this time." In July, Mr Usher said: "Whilst our study is examining all aspects of RIFW, including its governance arrangements and its oversight by the Welsh government, we are also undertaking a detailed examination of all land disposal transactions and investment decisions. "In particular, our auditors are looking at the RIFW decisions to sell land privately rather than by public auction." The nature of the land varied from farms in Gwynedd to a former industrial site in the Cynon Valley and part of a business park in Newport. But the area with the greatest value was 120 acres (nearly 50 hectares) of farmland near the village of Lisvane on the northern edge of Cardiff which had been in public ownership for many years. The land was sold for an agricultural rate of around £15,000 an acre but four months later it was included in Cardiff council's planning blueprint for new housing. This paved the way for part of that land to become some of the most valuable in Wales with a potential price of around £1m an acre. There is a claw back mechanism which means the taxpayer will be able to share in any increase in its value. That figure has not been revealed but BBC Wales understands that it is not more than 50% of the increase. Another valuable site is 16 acres of land (six hectares) on the outskirts of Monmouth which was valued by the Welsh government at around £1m. Since the sale, a joint planning application has been made to Monmouthshire council by South Wales Land Developments for 370 homes. And in the Bridgend area, a stretch of land was valued at £100,000 near Pyle. Since then, an application has been made to Bridgend council by South Wales Land Developments for 94 homes. While there are claw back mechanisms in place for Lisvane and Monmouth, there are none applying to the other pieces of land. Concerns over the method of the sale were first referred to the auditors by the Conservative assembly member Byron Davies. The land had been in public ownership for many years having been bought by the Land Authority for Wales and the Welsh Development Agency before coming under the control of the Welsh government. It was transferred by the Welsh government to RIFW in 2010, which operates at arms length but was still ultimately controlled by the Welsh government. RIFW had been set up to invest in the regeneration of town centres and was funded by European and Welsh government money. Instead of providing cash directly, the Welsh government funds were generated by RIFW selling off those 16 parcels of land for around £21m. The Welsh government had already suspended the regeneration investment fund and launched two internal investigations before Friday's decision. In the past the Welsh government defended the sale, saying it was in excess of the independent market valuation and the land was bundled up to avoid developers cherry picking the best sites. South Wales Land Developments has said the deal has led to much needed commercial activity on the sites after years in which there was little activity. Both claimed the use of claw back arrangements would reflect any significant uplift in the value of the land. BBC Wales tried to get hold of the spokesman for the wound-up body but has not had a response. </body>

      <title>Firefighters' strike called off</title>
      <description>A planned five-hour strike by firefighters in England and Wales on Saturday has been called off, union bosses say.</description>

      <body>A planned five-hour strike by firefighters in England and Wales has been called off, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has said. The union said the decision came after progress in talks over pensions - the strike had been due to take place from 18:30 until 23:30 BST on Saturday. The government wants firefighters to work up to 60 but the union says this is too old to be fighting fires. The FBU said it had been presented with a deal similar to that in Scotland. This means firefighters will be able to retire on a full pension between the the ages of 55 and 60 if they are genuinely not fit enough and another role cannot be found for them. A member of staff who does meet the fitness standards and chooses to retire early will get a reduced pension. A final agreement has not yet been reached because negotiations will need to take place between ministers and individual fire authorities about how this will be funded. Firefighters in Scotland voted against a strike. The FBU said 32,000 union members in England and Wales walked out for four hours when it staged a first round of action last month. Contingency plans at the 46 fire services in England and three in Wales included using part-time and volunteer firefighters, calling in non-union fire crews and bringing in private contractors. The armed forces had a back-up role and in the event of a major incident union members could have returned to work. No major incidents were reported during the strike which was the first national walkout for a decade. </body>

      <description>Councils work together on £1bn hydro-electric estuary plan</description>

      <body>A hydro-electric project in the Severn Estuary worth more than £1bn could be the first in a series of collaborations between Cardiff and Bristol councils. The two authorities plan to sign a memorandum of understanding once it has been approved by both cabinets. If passed, Cardiff said the first joint initiative could be a twin tidal lagoon. It follows plans for a £25bn barrage being described as "dead in the water" for the time being. Utilising the Severn's tidal range - the second biggest in the world - it is claimed the lagoons could generate enough electricity to power the whole of the region. "Obviously the tidal lagoon is what's catching the headlines today, but that's only part of something much bigger," said councillor Ashley Govier, Cardiff council's cabinet member for environment. "Cardiff and Bristol are both too small to compete on our own with the city-regions of London, Birmingham and Manchester, but we can be big players if we work regionally and collaboratively. "Taking charge of our own green and affordable energy needs is part of that, but also we need to work on housing, transport and a whole raft of issues to make the Severnside area a more attractive place to live and work." The proposed system would see a network of hydro-turbines encased in a concrete wall at either side of the Severn Estuary. The Severnside project is similar to one currently under consideration in Swansea. However, while the Swansea lagoon would provide renewable electricity for 100,000 homes, the Cardiff/Bristol operation is projected to power double that - possibly more if neighbouring authorities came on board. "As the biggest two authorities, Cardiff and Bristol had to take the initiative on this project and on the regional partnership as a whole," added Mr Govier. "But we very much want to bring in our neighbouring authorities, so for us the Vale of Glamorgan, Newport etc and from Bristol's point of view the Somerset authorities." The project would work by harnessing the Severn's tides behind concrete dams. When there is a sufficient difference between the depths on either side of the dam, sluice gates would be opened to release the trapped water, turning turbines and generating the electricity. Mr Govier said that while Cardiff and Bristol were in discussions with several private companies, he hoped it would remain a project which could ultimately benefit taxpayers. "The scale of the tidal lagoon project we're envisaging would cost considerably more than £1bn, so it's obvious that the only way we could achieve it would be with private backing," he said. "But it's not something we'd just sell on, it has to have a tangible benefit for the region and its people. "We could either sell the electricity into the National Grid to raise income and reduce our reliance on taxation, or alternatively we could sell it to a specific electricity supplier with the caveat that it has to be passed on to consumers in the region at a heavily reduced rate." He added: "As a council and a region we need to be doing more to make Severnside an attractive option for business to come to." Hafren Power wants to build an 11-mile (18km) barrage between Lavernock Point near Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, and Brean near Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. But in September, barrage supporter and Neath MP Peter Hain said that plans for a £25bn barrage in the Severn Estuary were "dead in the water" in the current Parliament. Mr Hain said the UK government had refused to commit to it. In June, MPs said Hafren had failed to make the case that it would be good for the economy or the environment. </body>

      <body>A BBC studio manager died after falling from a cliff at a well known mountain spot in Snowdonia, it has been confirmed. David March, 36, from Thornton Heath in south London, worked for BBC World Service and had been employed at the corporation for 15 years. Mr March fell up to 330ft (100m) from above Devil's Kitchen in the Ogwen Valley on 12 October. He was an experienced walker who was a regular visitor to Snowdonia. Mr March worked for the languages' production team. He spent most of his career at Bush House, in London, before moving to the World Service's new premises at New Broadcasting House in 2012. Speaking at the time of the incident, Chris Lloyd, from the Ogwen Valley team, said it was "an unfortunate tragic accident" and Mr March may have made a navigational error and walked off a cliff. Devil's Kitchen, or Twll Du (Black Hole) in Welsh, is a very well known route above Cwm Idwal in the Ogwen Valley. It marks a tricky crack in rocks which can be scrambled up to reach the Glyder range of peaks and Y Garn. The route can prove challenging for many walkers, especially if there is poor weather and mist, as the path through the rocks and cliffs is ill-defined. </body>

      <body>Firefighters are warning about the dangers of leaving cooking unattended after two fires in the Conwy area. A 79-year-old man suffered minor burns to his head and arms on Thursday after a chip pan ignited at a property in Llandudno when he had fallen asleep. It followed another call-out to a flat in Colwyn Bay after a fire sparked by an unattended microwave. It comes as North Wales Fire and Rescue Service launches a campaign on cooking safety. "More than half of all accidental dwelling fires we attend in north Wales are cooking related," said Gwyn Jones from north Wales fire service. "The best advice we can give to people is to throw away your old style chip pan - use a thermostatically controlled deep fryer instead which cannot overheat and ignite in the same way. "Never turn your back on cooking, even for a short time, and make sure you have a working smoke alarm." On Friday the fire service launched its "We Don't Want To Come Dine With You" campaign on cooking safety. Over the next few months, fire officers will be offering advice to shoppers in north Gwynedd, as well as handing out kitchen timers and setting a kitchen cooking safety quiz. "Time and time again we attend house fires which have started in the kitchen - it is so easy to forget your cooking, especially if you are tired, distracted or have been drinking," added Mr Jones. "But the consequences can be devastating. We don't want to come dine with you and tackle your kitchen fire." </body>

      <description>Councils in Wales will have their Welsh government funding cut by between 4.6 and 1.2% next year, ministers have announced.</description>

      <body>Details of cuts to every local councils' budget from the Welsh government have been announced. Funding for Ceredigion, Denbighshire and Powys will fall by 4.6% but Newport will only experience a 1.2% cut. Prior to the announcement, the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) warned that most councils were unprepared for the scale of cuts. Many of Wales' 22 councils have already started to plan for how they will meet their budget shortfalls. It is expected that cuts to services such as libraries, refuse collections and public toilets will be made across the country. The funding has been distributed according to a formula, taking into account factors such as the number of school pupils, the age profile and size of the local population. Next year's funding is the first to be based on 2011 census figures. Rural areas will experience bigger cuts because of projected reductions in their populations. Newport's settlement is less harsh because its population is rising and it has a large number of school pupils. The government's draft budget last week prioritised the health service, with £570m extra for the NHS. Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems had made a deal with Labour before the announcement to allow the minority government to pass its budget when AMs vote on it in the coming months. Making Wednesday's announcement, Local Government Minister Lesley Griffiths said the total settlement was £4.26bn. She acknowledged the situation was "extremely challenging". The minister said she had included a mechanism ensuring no single council faced an "unmanageable reduction in their allocation" compared to last year, and had transferred over £30m in grants to give councils greater flexibility in managing resources. "I could not have been clearer about the future financial reality facing local government in Wales and I have provided warning of the likely shape of budget reductions," Ms Griffiths said. "For the last three years, the Welsh government has shielded local government from the full force of the cuts to allow them to prepare for the transformational change necessary to maintain vital local services, whilst limiting any additional financial pressure on hard-pressed households." Asked whether local authorities could raise council tax above the 5% limit set informally by the Welsh government, Ms Griffiths said: "I would have to look at that. "I have made it very clear that I have powers to cap and I would have to look very closely at that. But, at the moment, no figures have been mentioned to me. "I will have to see what comes forward and take the decision then." She criticised Rhondda Cynon Taf for using the term "armageddon" in describing the local authority cuts earlier in the week. Ms Griffiths said it was "over the top" and called on councils not to carry out "knee jerk" reactions. She also said that modelling by the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) of a council tax rise of 3.5% was "probably about right" but said she did not have a specific figure in mind. Conservative local government shadow minister Janet Finch-Saunders said: "Labour, the nationalists and Lib Dems agreed a very challenging settlement for Welsh local authorities, which means tough decisions and a forensic scrutiny of council spending. "The challenge for local authorities is to resist the easy options of putting up the council tax bills of hardworking families or cutting frontline services. "Welsh councils need to go through their budgets line by line and eliminate wasteful spending, improve their tax collection rates and deliver services in more imaginative ways. The WLGA said councils were facing "unprecedented funding reductions". It called for "less central regulation and prescription" to allow councils to change the way they run public services. WLGA deputy leader and finance spokesperson Aaron Shotton said: "Whatever councils do, these cuts mean that the public services delivered by local government in Wales will look significantly different within the next three to five years. "Communities throughout Wales will have to revise their expectations significantly in terms of what services they can realistically expect their local councils to deliver, and local councils and their communities will need to engage in some very difficult discussions on what services should be prioritised." BBC Wales' economics correspondent Sarah Dickins writes: It is councillors in Ceredigion, Denbighshire and Powys who will really be feeling pressure with cuts of 4.6% in the money they get from Welsh government. In contrast, in Newport there will be relief that its budget from April is only being cut by 1.2%. Councils have known for months that they will have many millions less to run public services such as social care, school dinners, leisure centres and roads than they have had this year or, for that matter, the year before. Now they have to make decisions about whether to axe specific services, whether to get private companies to run them or whether the work can be done differently, for instance by volunteers or community groups. They will also have to decide how much they can turn to residents for help by increasing council tax. The cuts in funding from Welsh government will have to be found in what is in effect only one third of each council's overall money. Around 40% of their budget is ring-fenced for schools and a further 25% is protected for social services. The remaining 35% does not just pay for services from school meals to gritting to refuse collection but also for councils' long-term borrowing arrangements. A four-week consultation period now begins and councils' final budgets will be set by the end of February. BBC Wales' business correspondent Brian Meechan writes: Councils have a number of options on the table as they face the squeeze. Staff costs make up the bulk of most spending on public services. A Wales Audit Office report said the public sector would need to "identify novel ways of reducing their staffing bills". That could mean flexible working, with reduced hours or moving from full-time to part-time work. It could also mean councils outsourcing some services, for example benefits, computing and technology, and facilities management, to private companies. This can involve the whole scale transfer of staff to the private sector but doesn't necessitate that. Private companies have not proved a popular choice in Wales where local authorities have seemed reluctant to use them as a solution to their financial woes. It's also unpopular with trade unions. But in England, it's a route that many councils have gone down. Mouchel is one company that's profited from this approach. In partnership with Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Services, it maintains highways, road markings, public lighting and street signs for Westminster Council. Meanwhile, Capita runs Service Birmingham, a joint venture with the council that provides IT services. The company says the partnership has led to improved services, reduced costs and created a more efficient, motivated workforce. But there are those who believe that public services shouldn't be about creating profit for private companies and they're sceptical of the claims of improved efficiency. The issues around profit and public services are what's led to a growth in Wales in what's come to be known as the "third sector"- it's neither public nor private. While charities are a part of this, it goes beyond them to describe other organisations that are run as businesses with any profits being reinvested into the business or in other social activities. Many of those third sector organisations are coming together in Cardiff today for the Social Enterprise Wales Conference and councils will almost certainly be looking at how much bigger a role they can play in future provision of services. Some of the bigger examples of these are housing associations. The growth in these over the last decade or so came from some authorities transferring the ownership of their housing stock to not-for-profit housing associations including Valleys to Coast which took over Bridgend's properties. Neath Port Talbot council's leisure facilities meanwhile are run by the not-for-profit Celtic Leisure. It was set up in 2003, long before the financial crash and the cutbacks. It's also happened on a smaller scale when local communities have come together to keep facilities going when they were threatened with closure, Harlech Swimming Pool and the Swansea Tennis Centre being two successful examples. Of course, councils could save by working more closely together as the Welsh government has asked them to do. Their track record though is far from convincing. In 2012, Conwy and Denbighshire councils scrapped plans to merge highways departments. The 22 councils are also supposed to be working together in 4 regional consortia to improve schools which the Education Minister, Huw Lewis, told Good Morning Wales earlier has "not been functioning very well". If councils can't make savings by co-operation, attention may turn to whether there needs to be a reduction in their number as has happened with Local Health Boards. Supporters of reorganisation say it will lead to savings as departments and senior roles are merged. Those against argue that it would be a fraction of cuts that are required and would result in years of problems as councils are distracted from the task of delivering services within tightening budgets while dealing with dramatic changes to their organisations. BBC Wales' arts correspondent Huw Thomas writes: The amount of money that councils spend on the arts and culture is a relatively small proportion of the overall pot, but these services are often funded without any statutory obligation by the local authorities. The situation means there's never any certainty that the funding will continue if the financial climate deteriorates, and the prospect of a significantly tougher 2014/15 local government settlement has already prompted councils to review the services that they fund. Cardiff council has proposed completely cutting the annual grants it gives to some arts organisations in order to save more than £220,000 - which includes stopping a grant worth £161,001 for Sherman Cymru. Flintshire council is reviewing the annual amount it gives to Clwyd Theatr Cymru, which received £1m from the local authority in 2012/13. Other local authorities are also reviewing the non-statutory services they fund, but some councils are also seeking to protect the cultural services that they consider to be a key part of their strategies for attracting tourism and investment. Swansea is currently bidding to be named UK City of Culture 2017, and its joint bid with Carmarthenshire and Neath Port Talbot could mean those authorities are reluctant to significantly reduce their spending on the arts as the judges examine what the area has to offer. </body>

      <title>Fresh barracks death inquest call</title>
      <description>Calls are made for a fresh inquest into the 1995 death of an Army recruit from Denbighshire, one of four at the Surrey barracks within seven years.</description>

      <body>Calls have been made by a human rights group for a fresh inquest into the death of an 18-year-old Army recruit from Denbighshire. Liberty is representing the parents of Cheryl James, from Llangollen, who died in November 1995 at Deepcut barracks in Surrey. She was one of four soldiers who died there between 1995 and 2002, sparking allegations of bullying and abuse. The attorney general's office said it was considering the application. Pte Sean Benton, 20, from Hastings, East Sussex, was found dead with gunshot wounds at the barracks in June 1995, just months before Pte James's death, also from gunshot wounds. In September 2001, 17-year-old Pte Geoff Gray, from Seaham, Co Durham, was found with two gunshot wounds to his head, and six months later, Pte James Collinson, from Perth, also 17, was found with a single gunshot wound upwards through his chin. A Surrey Police investigation was launched into the deaths in 2002, following pressure from the families who rejected suggestions the soldiers had committed suicide and called for a public inquiry. Later, a report by the Adult Learning Inspectorate, commissioned by the armed forces minister called for substantial reforms in the training of new recruits. A later investigation by deputy high court judge Nicholas Blake QC called for an independent ombudsman for the armed forces, but rejected the families' calls for a public inquiry. It also concluded that Ptes Gray, James and Benton had committed suicide. An inquest into Pte James' death held shortly after it happened recorded an open verdict. On Friday, Liberty announced it is applying for a fresh inquest into Pte James' death and will soon be doing the same on behalf of the parents of Pte Benton. The group said its application to the attorney general comes after using the Human Rights Act to get access to documentation about Pte James' death that her family have never seen, claiming 44 volumes of statements, documents, notes and photographs contain evidence that has never before been properly examined and suggesting witnesses may have lied. A fresh inquest can be ordered if there is evidence of fraud, irregularity of proceedings, insufficiency of inquiry or new evidence. If the attorney general gives his consent, the matter will be referred to the High Court for consideration, Liberty said. Legal officer Emma Norton said: "Cheryl's grieving family have been consistently snubbed by the state in their quest to discover what really happened to their daughter - only a fresh inquest can deliver the truth they so deserve. "The human rights of our troops are worthy of exactly the same protection as everyone else - until what happened to these young people at Deepcut is competently, calmly and independently investigated, justice will not be done". Pte James' parents Des and Doreen James added: "We're disappointed it has taken close to 18 years for us to even get disclosure of the evidence related to Cheryl's premature death. "No family should ever have to go through what we've experienced, and the fact there still has never been any meaningful inquiry into the four deaths at Deepcut remains a stain on the integrity of everyone involved. "All four were placed in the care of the state and all four were badly let down. "The implications of the new evidence is both serious and extremely worrying for us but we have every confidence in Liberty and our entire legal team." A spokeswoman for the attorney general's office confirmed that it had received an application from Liberty seeking the attorney general's consent to apply for a new inquest into Pte James' death, and it was being considered. </body>

      <body>Dean Keates scored his second goal in two games as Wrexham beat struggling Woking in the Conference Premier. Keates received the ball from Jay Harris's short corner and his cross into the area deceived everyone to beat Sam Beasant. Woking rallied in the second half with Mike Cestor's header striking the crossbar and Andy Coughlin denying Scott Rendell. Joe Clarke sealed the win in the final minute with a composed finish. Victory extended Wrexham's unbeaten run to three games but Woking remain in the Conference Premier's bottom four. Wrexham player-manager Andy Morrell told BBC Radio Wales: "With all the problems we've had with centre-backs and the week we've had, to have a clean-sheet and win the game is really pleasing. "[In the] first half we were good, deserved our lead and I think in the game we probably had the better chances. But in the second half we stopped doing what we were doing in the first half. "A win's a win. That's what we said before [the game] - by hook or by crook we need to get three points to get us up this league." Woking manager Garry Hill told BBC Surrey: "We look at today's defeat as self-inflicted. I felt in the first twenty minutes we were in control and they were very low confidence. "I was fully aware that they were struggling but their goalkeeper made some very important saves. "I was probably more disappointed from the time that they scored the goal, which seemed to give them a lift and I felt that we never did enough today. "We didn't contribute enough and there were some choice words at half-time. "I think we looked more with it in the second-half. And I ask my players why didn't we hurt them enough." </body>

      <body>A former Denbigh mayor accused of causing a series of explosions in the town told a jury he "made fireworks, not bombs". John Larsen, 46, said he played no part in the explosions in the Lenten Pool area between January and April. Mr Larsen denies causing an explosion, possessing explosives and three arson attacks on cars. He told Caernarfon Crown Court he did not get a "thrill" from his alleged actions. Mr Larsen, a Liberal Democrat town councillor, denied the prosecution's claim that he created gunpowder for explosions. "No, I didn't make any of the explosions," he told prosecutor Wyn Lloyd Jones. Mr Lloyd Jones asked: "Were you getting a thrill from speaking to the newspaper?" Mr Larsen replied: "No. I was asked to speak to the newspaper." He also denied getting a thrill from appearing on television, claiming he only appeared on screen "for a couple of seconds". Mr Larsen denied setting off an improvised explosive device on 24 March near his home with ball-bearings added as shrapnel. But he has accepted experimenting with fuels for firework rockets in his garden. Mr Larsen told the court he bought chemicals for magic tricks and others for fireworks. The former stonemason, who stopped working in 2004 after injuring his back, said his hobbies were photography, fireworks and "hand magic". He told the court he performed magic shows for family and friends. But Mr Lloyd Jones suggested none of the items found at his home were related to magic or displays for children. "That's incorrect," Mr Larsen said. "I have been practising magic for a number of years." Mr Lloyd Jones went on: "You have been practising explosions for three months." "No, I haven't. I get fed up of being called a liar," Mr Larsen replied. "I didn't do the explosions." The trial continues. </body>

      <body>A town council is looking for a new home after it was left with a £20,000 bill to bring its current Victorian building up to fire safety standards. Newtown Town Council has been told the fire alarm system in its 19th Century headquarters needs upgrading. It also needs new fire doors and might need re-wiring after a fire report described the building as "unsafe and unacceptable". It has approached Powys council about using one of its buildings. The current town council building also houses a museum honouring the social reformer Robert Owen, who was born in the town. Last month, Deputy Mayor Richard Edwards said it had failed to comply with a series of new fire regulations which had been introduced in the last few years. Speaking at a full council meeting this month, town council clerk Jenn Jones said that the report required a substantial list of improvements which had to be carried out immediately. The costs of carrying out the work was estimated to be well in excess of £20,000 and not all the estimates for the work were yet known. It was unanimously agreed that the council would actively explore vacating the building. A Powys council spokesman said: "The town council have approached us to see if we can find them some accommodation within our buildings if and when they have to leave their current building. "We have held initial discussions but nothing has yet been decided." </body>

      <title>How will Welsh councils save cash?</title>
      <description>Wales' 22 local authorities have been told what their individual budgets for next year will be, but what is your council planning to do to make savings?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-24525092</url>

      <body>The total amount of cash available to councils around Wales to pay for services such as bin collections, libraries, leisure centres and public toilets has been announced by the Welsh government. It was announced last week that funding for local government would see a cut of 5.81% next year. Local government spending will fall from £4.648bn this year to £4.466bn next year, a cut in cash terms of 3.91% or 5.81% in real terms. Their budgets will be around 9% lower in real terms between now and 2015-16. So how are Wales' 22 local authorities going to deal with budget shortfalls: Council leader Ieuan Williams said: "We now anticipate that the council will face cuts in the region of £7-8m and cuts of this magnitude will hit the authority hard. "It's more than likely that we'll again be forced to raise Council Tax by the maximum 5% with a smaller percentage increase unsustainable." Finance portfolio holder Hywel Eifion Jones added: "The reduction in funding for Anglesey of -4% against a Welsh average of -3.5% seems most unfair given our high levels of elderly and unemployed residents. "The provisional settlement is disappointing news from the Welsh government and bound to have a significant effect on the level of Council Tax and future services. "We'll shortly start consulting with fellow councillors and the public regarding their priorities, but clearly some services will need to be provided in a different way in the future." Anglesey chief executive Richard Parry Jones said: "We'll now have to assess the significant impact that the settlement will have on our capacity to provide services. "The council's heads of service are currently working on initial recommendations for efficiency savings, and these will have to be prioritised by our elected members in due course. "We also, of course, intend to consult widely with stakeholders and partners as part of the process of formulating the council budget for 2014/15. "The decisions will be difficult and it is inevitable that we will have to curtail services to the people of Anglesey." BBC Wales news website is awaiting a response from Blaenau Gwent council. Mel Nott, Leader of Bridgend County Borough Council, said: "It is now inevitable that we face having to make some very difficult decisions. "This will obviously have a huge effect on council services, but we are preparing for the challenge by making changes that will move the authority away from some of the more traditional activities and structures associated with local government. "The council has a medium-term financial strategy in place which is ensuring that we prioritise and focus our available resources efficiently and in a co-ordinated manner. "We need to fundamentally alter the way in which the council works, spends money and makes use of resources, so in future there will be a greater focus on innovation, shared services, lower costs and collaboration. "However, there should be no illusions about the reality of the situation that we face, nor the pressing need to start looking at making savings in areas that we have previously tried to protect." A spokesman for Caerphilly council said: "We are going to have to make some very difficult decisions in the wake of this extremely tough budget announcement. "Even though the situation is very challenging, Caerphilly is in a good position compared to some other Welsh local authorities and this is largely down to the sound financial strategy adopted by the council over the last few years." Councillors will consider the budget settlement on 23 October. The council needs to try and bridge a budget shortfall of £125m over the next three years. Among its plans, it will reassess the way grants are awarded to ensure there is greater fairness in funding decisions and better service delivery based on requirements and community priorities. The council currently provides £2.7m in grant funding to a wide range of third sector organisations but says many grants are historic with no clear indication of strategic need. It is considering new ways of delivering services which include merging departments and collaborating with other councils. However it has warned that it is considering "drastic measures" such as service reduction and even ending some services completely. Its budget proposals are being prepared over the next few months before going out to public consultation. Next week, all members of the council will be invited to discuss around 60 proposals for efficiency savings to bridge the funding gap Carmarthenshire faces, before a large-scale public consultation is launched. Council leader Kevin Madge has already warned people to brace themselves for change, and has acknowledged that members will be faced with making tough and unpopular decisions over the coming months. Now, he is calling on all 74 members of the council as well as community and voluntary groups to work together to ensure as many services and jobs can be protected. "This is one of the toughest settlements we've ever had," he said. "We've already tightened our belts and made significant efficiency savings in the last few years, which is why it's going to be hard to cut back further. "However, by working together with our communities, we will stand a better chance of protecting front-line services and jobs. "I also call on every member of council to work together, similar to how they've worked together in Welsh government where they've put their political differences aside to move forward and set a budget." Earlier, a spokesman for Carmarthenshire council said: "We are holding an elected members seminar shortly which will set out the council's financial position, and give members the opportunity to discuss and consider up to 40 separate options and proposals for savings. "Over the coming months, consultation will also involve the general public, local businesses and stakeholder groups. "Until this exercise has been undertaken, we can't say exactly what services will be affected." A spokesperson for Ceredigion Council said the authority will be facing a reduction in funding from the Welsh Government of 4.6%, which is a cash reduction of almost £5m. That reduction is before taking into account the need to increase the existing budget for inflationary increases, additional funding for implementing national pay awards, and budgetary pressures on existing services, which means that the council will need to identify budget savings in the region of £9.5m for 2014/15. Councillor Ellen ap Gwynn, leader of the council, said: "This is the worst ever financial settlement for Welsh Local Authorities and in particular for Ceredigion by some margin. "It is an unprecedented situation for all Welsh local authorities, but is especially challenging for rural councils such as Ceredigion. "We will have to make some very difficult decisions over the next few months as we try and minimise the impact on the existing services, and we must accept that some services will need to be reduced or even cut." In a report, the local authority said: "Conwy's financial framework for the period 2012 to 2017 highlighted an extremely challenging financial landscape which predicted an annual resource shortfall of around £5m per year for the financial years covered, even after council tax increases of around 5% per year. "Indeed 2014/2015 projected a shortfall of £4.5m with warnings that 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 were likely to be at similar levels ie 'more of the same'." A spokesperson for Denbighshire Council said: "Denbighshire council has been expecting a difficult budget settlement and we have been preparing for it. "The reduction of 4.6% is on the more severe end of what we have been planning for and it will require the council to take some difficult decisions. "Options for reductions are now being developed for elected members to consider during their deliberations over the next few months. "Final decisions on the 2014/15 budget will be taken in the new year. "The council is committed to delivering excellent services and maximising efficiencies from everything it does will be its key response to this settlement. "On the positive side the council welcomes the apparent relaxation of 'ring fencing' rules for a number of grants and budget areas. "We haven't had the time to analyse the figures carefully yet, but it seems that the council will be able to look for efficiencies and savings from a wider area than was possible in 2013/14 and this is to be welcomed." The council's initial reaction to the local settlement is: Council leader Aaron Shotton said: "The provisional settlement is as predicted. The task ahead is to plan significant and rapid change within the council to make major savings to balance the books for 2014-15 and protect local services to the best of our ability. "It is important that we are not hit by any reductions in the specific grants from Welsh government which support day to day services from education to recycling. "These grants are normally confirmed long after the settlement and we do not want unexpected 'devil in the detail'. "We cannot absorb a double financial 'hit' in a matter of months. "Flintshire is a stable and well performing council - we now have a major job on our hands to hold that position." The council is looking to reorganise and reduce the cost and complexity of management as well as a phased reduction in workforce numbers. A spokesman said before the budget announcement: "The way the council will have to change and become even more modern will remain underpinned by protecting and developing the most important public services in communities, being as modern and high performing as we can in customer services and being as efficient and cost effective as possible." A spokesman for Gwynedd Council said: "At present, we estimate that we could be facing a £16m funding shortfall in 2014/15. "Thanks to long-term financial planning, we have already identified over £6m of savings to help bridge this gap, and we estimate that other potential measures identified will lead to an additional saving of around £6m. "This means that we will need to deliver a further £4m during the year. "We are looking at a number of possible options to mitigate the demand for our services, and carefully weighing up the possible savings that could be achieved against the potential negative impact upon the county's residents." Councillor Brendan Toomey, the leader of Merthyr Tydfil council, said: "Like the other 22 council's across Wales, Merthyr Tydfil CBC had already started to plan for how we would meet our budget deficit for 2014/15. "While originally working on a - 4% budget cut, in real terms £6.1m deficit, we are now looking at an actual deficit of £3.5m. "Whilst the 2.2% is better than expected, this council will still have to make some very serious and unprecedented cuts which will mean that the services that we deliver to the people of Merthyr Tydfil will look different within the next three to five years. "As always, we will continue to work extremely hard in order to protect the most vulnerable in the community whilst also protecting as many staff within the organisation as possible." Peter Fox, leader of Monmouthshire County Council, said: "We are disappointed but not surprised that we have seen a provisional cut of 4.4% in our annual settlement from the Welsh government. "Although it is slightly worse than we'd been led to believe, we have for some time been planning for a cut of around this level. "We have managed a significant year-on-year decline in our funding for some time now, against a backdrop of our being Wales' lowest funded council per head of population. "We have already taken significant steps toward addressing this shortfall in our funding. "We are currently meeting directly with our communities, and cabinet has already mandated officers to explore proposed savings of £6.5m, although we are mindful that this would not be sufficient to meet next year's cut. "We will continue to work hard to address next year's shortfall and the projected shortfall of £23m over the next four years." The council has already outlined plans to make £6.5m in savings and will hold a number of public engagement meetings in the county over the next two weeks. Among the areas where savings could be made is school transport. The authority is considering reviewing its school transport arrangements based on nearest school policy. It is also considering reducing grants to the third sector and transforming adult social care and children's services. Reductions to cleaning rounds and gritting schedules could also be introduced as well as street lights being switched off. Five public consultation sessions are to be held about the matter and the council has scheduled that the proposals will be concluded by the end of November 2013 with a special cabinet meeting on 18 December. A spokesperson for the council said: "We will be looking at the details of the draft settlement and preparing a report for cabinet on our options for savings for members to decide upon." A spokesman said it had developed a forward financial plan which identified the need for £23m savings over the next four years (this is on top of £30m savings over the past four years). A report will be prepared for members regarding the specific impact of the settlement and what the options will be. A spokesman for the council said it also has a report out to consult on proposals for its library provision for savings of up to £238,000. A spokesperson for Newport City Council said that as expected it would "once again receive a cut to its revenue budget from Welsh government". "The council fully anticipated a reduction and has been making plans to change the way it delivers services with less money and an increased demand," said the spokesperson. "The council recognises it still has to make significant savings and is faced with the task of redesigning public services as set out in the recently published 'Prospectus for Change'. "The next few years will be extremely difficult and the impact on services will be profound. "Residents can already submit their comments and ideas for improvement by emailing changing.services@newport.gov.uk. "A full public consultation on budget proposals will be launched later this year." Reacting to the settlement cut leader Jamie Adams, said that his authority faced severe challenges in common with other councils in Wales. "As I have previously said, we have to accept that local authorities are not immune from the cuts and we have a part to play in the belt-tightening process during these straitened times," he said. "However, when we do make the difficult decisions that we will undoubtedly face, we will do our utmost to ensure that front-line services and the vulnerable are protected as much as possible. "I believe that as we are an authority which is on a firm, financial footing we are able to meet and resolve these challenges. "The council's cabinet will be receiving a comprehensive report on the implications of the Budget at its 4th November meeting." The council has said it will be moving to fortnightly black bin bag collections to save £500,000 a year. It is also planning to reduce the number of public toilets it is responsible for - there are currently 93 public toilets in Pembrokeshire costing the council £1.5m a year to run. Seven are earmarked for closure. Mr Adams has said it was inevitable that Welsh government cuts in funding to local government would have repercussions on the authority's future spending. "We have to accept that, as a local authority, we too have to play a part in the belt-tightening process during these straitened times. "However, when we do make the difficult decisions that we will undoubtedly face, we will do our utmost to ensure that front-line services and the vulnerable are protected as much as possible," he said. Powys says it will face a cut in funding of nearly £9m in the next financial year along with increased "service pressures" of £11m leaving the county facing a funding shortfall of £20m for 2014/15. Leader David Jones said: "Powys has once again fared badly with its annual budget allocation with a 4.6% cut in funding - jointly the largest in Wales and well above the Welsh average cut of 3.5%. "Powys has experienced below Welsh average funding for five out of the last six years and that poor funding trend has continued greatly increasing the pressure on providing local services. There are also early indications that there could be a further cut of around 2% in 2015/16. "We are grateful that there has been some protecting provided by Welsh government otherwise the news could have been even worse. "This year we received £190.6m external funding from Welsh government but that figure will be reduced to £182.2m next year. Added to that the council is facing increasing demand for services and unavoidable costs that could add a further £11m added to our operating costs. "Providing viable public services with such reduced budgets will be a huge challenge, particularly since the majority of our funding is used for 'protected services' - education and adult social care. "The remaining service areas such as highways, waste, leisure and the arts, although hugely appreciated, will have to bear the brunt of very difficult budget decisions. "We have already been forced to take unpopular decisions in response to the chill wind of austerity measures but I am afraid the coming years will see far more difficult debates and I hope that Powys residents understand our difficulties." Council leader Anthony Christopher said: "Considering how significantly public sector funding to Wales has been cut by the UK government a settlement of this nature was inevitable. "This council has already taken the very difficult step of bringing forward options on how we bridge the significant gap in funding we now face and is due to consider initial proposals next week. "Based on the provisional information released today, as predicted the level of savings we will be faced with making over the next four years will now be above our original indication of £56m. "Because the Welsh government has done its utmost to protect Wales' public services from the worst of the UK government's cuts, this is the first financial year that 'all' our communities will really feel the pain and the realities of the UK governments public sector funding cuts. "Despite the severity of the decisions already being considered it is clear that further and even tougher decisions around the range and level of services we offer will need to be taken in the coming months. "In my 25 years in local government I have never had to consider such a bleak outlook for public services. "My colleagues and I know fully how the decisions we will need to take will impact upon the communities we represent, but faced with such significant reductions in funding we simply have no alternatives. "In the coming weeks therefore the cabinet will be forced to consider further reductions and significant changes to the services we currently provide. "Very clearly the austerity measures of the UK government are biting and the effects of Wales' funding being reduced by £1.6bn are set to become very apparent in our local communities." Cabinet members at Rhondda Cynon Taf Council are due to meet next week to consider the first phase of a programme of cuts. Under the proposals children in RCT will start full-time school a year later than they currently do in a bid to save £4.5m a year. Closing 14 of 26 libraries in RCT could save £800,000 per year, while closing 10 out of 19 day centres could save £600,000 per year. Proposed changes to youth services could save £2.2m while £300,000 could be saved by ending the delivery of meals on wheels at the weekend. Swansea council said the headline settlement figure of a 3.1% reduction in funding was broadly in line with expectations. The council said it would be studying the Welsh government's figures in detail but expected overall that it would have to make savings of £45m by 2017. Apart from a reduced settlement, the council said it was also facing a range of funding pressures including rising customer expectation and increasing demand for adult and children's services. Rob Stewart, cabinet member for finance, said: "We've already been consulting with local residents and most people I've talked to understand we are in tough times and the budget issue is a difficult position not of the council's making. "This isn't simply about trying to save money. We have an opportunity to transform the council by finding better ways of doing things to improve the services we provide." He added: "No decisions have been made yet because we are consulting with residents, stakeholders and staff to consider their views." Swansea has been holding a consultation with residents called Sustainable Swansea. Detailed budget proposals will be set out in December. The council predicts it requires savings of at least a further £40m over the next four years. Cuts to school transport service, black bag collections and garden waste collections are being considered. It has said making those savings is "no longer a case of trimming the edges" and has warned of difficult and uncomfortable decisions to be made. The executive member for resources, Councillor Anthony Hunt, said: "We must look at the local services we provide, consider our priorities and look at how they impact on our desire to protect the most vulnerable people in our communities. "Instead of burying our heads in the sand or making decisions behind closed doors, we want to be honest and open with people about the difficult situation and work together to find solutions. "We want to hear from residents about which services they value most, what they could do without and what they'd be prepared to pay more for." The council plans a number of joint working opportunities with neighbouring authorities and health boards including establishing jointly funded posts as part of its drive to plug the £25.7m funding shortfall. It says any targets set will be extremely challenging for services. It is due to meet to discuss proposals. Councillor Malcolm King OBE, Lead Member for Policy, Finance, Performance and Governance said: "There is no disguising the fact that this is very bad news for Wrexham. "In previous years, the council has made millions of pounds of savings year on year and has strived to protect schools and social care. "But the scale of the reductions contained in this announcement is unprecedented. It is very different to what the council have been planning for just a few months ago. "Unfortunately the funding situation looks bleak for quite a few years to come. "Although the challenge to find around £13m of cuts next year is very daunting, the longer term challenges are even more difficult." With a shortfall of at least £34m over the next five years, Wrexham has pledged to take a "fundamental look" at all of its work so resources can be used as "effectively as possible". The council has said: "This includes reprioritising and reducing services, ceasing services, considering alternative delivery models, working more effectively and efficiently with existing and new partners and eliminating waste. "Reshaping is also to be focused on improving services as well as enabling delivery at a lower cost." It plans to take a "package approach" to reshaping services saying that there was not a single project or single solution that will deliver the value of reductions required. It said: "The overall approach is not about tinkering with what we currently do. There will be a requirement to take a fundamental look at areas like reprioritising and reducing services, ceasing some services altogether, considering alternative delivery models, working more effectively and efficiently with existing and new partners and eliminating waste. Reshaping is also to be focused on improving services as well as enabling delivery at a lower cost." Areas the council are looking at in its ethos of the need to work differently include: </body>

      <body>Manager Gus Poyet's first game in charge of bottom club Sunderland ended in an emphatic defeat at Swansea. Black Cats defender Phil Bardsley skied a glorious chance at the far post before inadvertently scoring an own goal from Angel Rangel's corner, the first of three goals in seven minutes. Jonathan De Guzman curled in a second and Wilfried Bony added a penalty. Chico Flores headed in a late corner, credited as a Steven Fletcher own goal as Sunderland scrambled to clear. It left the Black Cats with one point from their first eight Premier League games - their worst start to a season. And their second-half capitulation provided Poyet with the evidence - if he needed it - of the size of the task he faces ahead of their next game, the Wear-Tyne derby against rivals Newcastle. His side are rooted to the bottom of the table and have conceded 20 goals, which is more than any other side in the division. For Swansea, an improved second-half display - including that three-goal burst - helped them wrap up the points and a first home league win since March. However, the game could have been a different story if the visitors had managed to capitalise on a scrappy Swans performance in the opening half. Scotland striker Fletcher was back from a shoulder injury after missing the last three games, and had his side's best chance of the first period. Fletcher, who had scored twice at the Liberty Stadium on his Black Cats debut last season, latched on to an early corner only to send his left-foot shot the wrong side of the post. Bardsley then had the goal in his sights, only to slice midfielder Emanuele Giaccherini's deflected cross horribly over from close range. The miss, along with whatever Swansea boss Michael Laudrup said to his side at the break, crucially turned the game in the home side's favour. Sunderland's goal led a charmed life as Michu angled a strike over, Bony shot high after Rangel's low cross to the near post and Nathan Dyer had a long range effort well saved by Kieren Westwood. However, Swansea's pressure told when a corner went in off Bardsley before De Guzman quickly added another with a 22-yard curling shot into the top corner. Poyet brought on ex-Swansea striker striker Fabio Borini and he could have reduced the deficit when played through on goal by Lee Cattermole, but he sidefooted high past onrushing keeper Michel Vorm. Instead, it soon got worse for Sunderland when Bony stroked in a spot-kick after Craig Gardner had clumsily brought down Leon Britton. And, despite keeper Westwood's heroics limiting the damage for Sunderland, he could not stop Flores powerfully headed in a corner - with the unfortunate Fletcher later credited with the final touch - to compound Poyet's misery. Swansea boss Michael Laudrup: "It was a very important win for us. It is a home win again after some time in the Premier League. "We knew it would be difficult. They have a new manager but fortunately we did our job, especially in the second half. "The players knew it was not good enough in the first half." Sunderland manager Gus Poyet: "It's difficult to take because there were things in the first half that we were able to do. We could not keep doing them in the second half and it is something we will look at. "We have been doing well in first half of many games, in the second half it changed completely and we will try to address that. "It is not a nice welcome to the Premier League for me but it is where we are. There is no place to hide and you have to take it. "It's up to us. There is nothing to complain about and we will make sure we keep working to sort it out for next week when we play Newcastle, which is one of the biggest games for the fans." </body>

      <description>Scarlets and Racing Metro battle to a Heineken Cup draw in a game which saw each side fight back in Llanelli.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/24551036</url>

      <body>Scarlets held on for a draw in the Heineken Cup against Racing Metro who were 20-10 down at the break. The French visitors led through Wenceslas Lauret's try and Jonathan Sexton's kicking. Rhys Priestland's boot and tries by Scott Williams and Rhodri Williams put the hosts ahead. Amid the Priestland-Sexton kicking duel, Racing's Masi Matadigo went over and Lauret was denied at the death by Sexton's knock-on in the build-up. The Llanelli-based region's backs were again full of invention and craft, but the visitors' pack had the edge of their opponents. Simon Easterby's side went into the clash boosted by their stunning opening round win at Harlequins while Racing Metro saw off beaten 2013 beaten finalists Clermont Auvergne 13-9 in Paris. At Harlequins, the the west Wales region established an early lead, but against this week's opponents, the hosts had to battle back. Racing took advantage of a disintegrating Scarlets scrum for flanker Lauret to gather and touched down, Ireland international Sexton adding the conversion. The British and Irish Lions fly-half added a penalty before Priestland put the home side on the scoreboard with his first shot at goal. Priestland helped create Scarlets' opening try as his innocuous-looking clearance bounced high, allowing Nic Reynolds to reach it. The wing tapped the ball into Jonathan Davies' arms and he sent Scott Williams away for the Wales challenger's second spectacular European try in six days. Priestland added the conversion and after Sexton missed a penalty, made amends by punishing Racing skipper Dimitri Szarzewski's yellow-card indiscretion at a ruck. Worse was to follow for the visitors, who saw replacement centre Fabrice Estebanez sin-binned following an off-the-ball clash with Scott Williams. That left the French side with 13 men for six minutes and when given the option to kick for goal or bid for a try from a close-range line-out, Scarlets chose the latter. The gamble paid off when scrum-half Rhodri Williams broke through the depleted defence to score. Priestland converted to establish a 20-10 half-time lead for the hosts. The Wales fly-half added another penalty early in the second period, but after being restored to a full complement, Racing launched their own fightback. Sexton's penalty was followed by number eight Matadigo powering over from a dominant scrum. The Ireland pivot added the extras before levelling with a penalty. The fly-halves' kicking exchange continued until interrupted by the latter's uncharacteristic 73rd minute miss. And there was dismay among the French side's ranks after Lauret's injury-time chase and touchdown was ruled out because Sexton had knocked the ball on as he stripped Josh Turnbull of possession. TEAMS Scarlets: L. Williams, Reynolds, J. Davies, S. Williams, J. Williams, Priestland, R. Williams, John, E. Phillips, Adriaanse, Ball, Earle, A. Shingler, Barclay, Turnbull.

      <title>Actor's anger over mural demolition</title>
      <description>Hollywood actor Michael Sheen has strongly criticised a council which "destroyed" a mural celebrating the 1839 Chartist uprising in south Wales.</description>

      <body>Hollywood actor Michael Sheen has strongly criticised Newport council which "destroyed" a mural celebrating the 1839 Chartist uprising. The star, who was born in Newport, has written a letter to the South Wales Argus to say: "The political system has let us down." The 35m (115ft) mosaic was demolished this month to make way for a £100m shopping centre, prompting protests. The council said it did not have the money to move or preserve the mural. The diggers moved in to tear down the artwork in a subway off John Frost Square on 3 October, a fortnight after Welsh heritage body Cadw declined to list the mosaic. The council's chief executive Will Godfrey later apologised for not giving councillors advance warning that the mural would be demolished. As workmen chipped away at the mosaic, which was created in 1978, protesters staged an impromptu demonstration. It was followed by a demonstration of about 200 people the following day who were angry at the council's actions. Sheen, star of films including Frost/Nixon, The Queen and the Twilight series, has now written an open letter to the South Wales Argus. In it, he urges people to "stand up for certain values and freedoms and ideals when they come under attack, whether through greed, malice, ignorance or sheer stupidity". He said he felt compelled to write for a number of reasons. "Firstly, the vicious irony of something that was created to celebrate those who risked much for the good of all, being wiped out without consulting the people themselves, and under the auspices of a Labour led city council serving the needs of profit above all else, is both absurd as well as tragic," he said. "That so little was done, or was able to be done, by us, in order to stop this from happening, brings shame to us all." He also urged action to ensure the Chartist movement was not forgotten in the city, urging the community to come together with ideas to replace the mural. "Having done something similar when working on The Passion [a three-day open air play with the community in Port Talbot] a few years ago, I was amazed and inspired by the vision, commitment and resourcefulness of the design students I worked with," he added. "Looking for found materials to work with, along with as much of the original destroyed mural as can be salvaged, could connect the past with the present in a grounded and economical way perhaps." He concluded: "I hope we can make the Chartists proud." Sheen was born in Newport and his family lived in Llanmartin in the county for 12 years before moving to Port Talbot when the actor was five. His father Meyrick Sheen, whose brother still lives in Newport, said he was not surprised his son had gotten involved. He told BBC Wales that Sheen had previously opened a Chartists' exhibition in the city's museum. The council has said it is looking at options to replace the mural, which depicted a fatal confrontation between democracy protesters and troops at Newport's Westgate Hotel in 1839 In his letter earlier this month, Mr Godfrey said he had attempted to contact local media to alert them about the demolition. "The process was not underhand or undemocratic as has been suggested in some parts of the media," he said. He went on: "Officers have advised the appropriate cabinet member that consultation should commence as soon as possible. 'Difficult decisions' "It is suggested that one of the options should be to commission a replica of the original mural." In response to the Hollywood star's letter, Newport council said it did not have the money to move or preserve the mural. "The mural's future has been on public record since March 2012, when a planning decision and separate public consultation confirmed that the mural would have to be demolished and the preferred option as a result of the consultation was for it to be reproduced on tiles," said a spokesperson. "More recently, as Cadw did not list the mural and Newport City Council did not have £625,000 to remove and preserve it, we understand that these decisions have been difficult for Newport residents both near and far. "The council found Mr Sheen's letter very interesting. It is forward thinking and contains some practical suggestions which the council will consider. "We also echo Mr Sheen's call to 'focus on how we can celebrate the past, connect it to the present and look hopefully to the future.' "We are currently asking all members of the public to give us their views on a new commemoration of the Chartists, details of which are on the council's website." </body>

      <description>Chelsea fight back from a goal down to thump Cardiff after scoring an equaliser which should not have stood.</description>

      <body>Chelsea fought back from a goal down to thump Cardiff after scoring an equaliser which should not have stood. Jordon Mutch ran through to put Cardiff ahead after David Luiz's mistake. But Eden Hazard levelled after Samuel Eto'o kicked the ball away as Bluebirds keeper David Marshall bounced it, which according to Fifa's rules is a foul. A well-worked Eto'o goal put Chelsea ahead and, after their boss Jose Mourinho was sent to the stands, Oscar and Hazard sealed the victory. Chelsea climb to second in the table but the scoreline was harsh on Cardiff - starting with the home side's equaliser in the 32nd minute. The laws of the game stipulate that the ball is considered under the goalkeeper's control when he bounces it, but referee Anthony Taylor allowed play to continue before Hazard fired home. Cardiff had taken the lead with a bizarre goal of their own. Luiz casually let the ball run past him after Ramires played it back to Cech, allowing Mutch to nip in and coolly slot home. The Welsh side were showing no ill-effects of a turbulent two-week period that saw the future of boss Malky Mackay put in doubt when his head of recruitment, Iain Moody, was replaced by unknown 23-year-old Kazakh Alisher Apsalyamov. Mackay has insisted he has no intention to quit, despite reports that Bluebirds owner Vincent Tan is also suggesting substitutions and tactics during games. Tan was not at Stamford Bridge and Mackay's tactics proved effective as his side soaked up Chelsea's attacks despite conceding the majority of possession, and frequently threatened on the break. John Terry twice went close to levelling with headers but it took a superb save from Petr Cech to stop Peter Odemwingie extending Cardiff's lead with a header from Peter Whittingham's free-kick. Chelsea's frustrations continued after their controversial equaliser, at least until Eto'o scored his first Premier League goal after 66 minutes by latching on to a Hazard pass and burying the ball past Marshall. The Bluebirds responded well and almost hit back when Kim Bo-Kyung stung Cech's palms. Mourinho had to watch what looked like being an anxious final 20 minutes from the stands, with Taylor ordering him from his technical area after he persistently complained to fourth official Trevor Kettle about the referee's decisions. But Oscar's fine strike from the edge of the box gave his side breathing space in the 78th minute and Hazard made it four soon after, dancing into the box before beating Marshall at his near post. </body>

      <body>Cardiff manager Malky Mackay is the "most important factor at this club", according to forward Craig Bellamy. Mackay has been in talks with the City board this week following the departure of his head of recruitment Iain Moody. "He's taken this club on to another level and what he's done has been remarkable," said Bellamy. "We're changing and trying to improve and it's all been down to him. I don't just have respect for him as a manager but also as a person." Mackay led the club into the Premier League for the first time and Bellamy added that the players know where they stand with the 41-year-old. "You have to perform, especially with our manager, because you know if you don't you are coming off at half-time - he's that ruthless!" Bellamy said. The off-the-field problems at the Cardiff City Stadium will not affect the players' preparations for Saturday's game against Chelsea, Bellamy insisted. The 34-year-old has been away in Belgium playing his final game with Wales before retiring from international football, so has been away from things for a few days. But he said: "No-one has really been talking about it. As players you are paid to play and your performances are what you are judged on, so you have to concentrate on that. "If you look from the outside you can look for excuses but that's not the mentality of the club or the players. "We're organised, the manager's gone through Chelsea so we know what we're up against. It was always going to be tough against them regardless of what's happened. "For me I have got a lot to concentrate on. The first thing is to get in the team and then try to keep my place. Then I want to get my performances to a level that I want them to be at. </body>

      <body>South Wales is becoming the UK centre of advanced armour technology for the military, according to Ministry of Defence (MoD) scientists. The UK government has joined forces with Kennametal Manufacturing in Newport to build a £2m facility. The plant will develop full-size ceramic armour plates to be fitted into uniforms and onto vehicles that will help protect troops on the frontline. It is the largest in Europe, helping to sustain 50 jobs at the Newport site. And it is the first facility in the UK that is able to manufacture these products with the MoD and Kennametal hoping it will help boost growth if they can export them to other countries. Richard Brooks, programme delivery director of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), which is a wing of the Ministry of Defence, said this was part of a 10-year collaboration with Kennametal. "This company's got the right potential, they're willing to invest, they're willing to try risky things, they're willing to innovate - they're a small, agile organisation," he said. "So that's the characteristics we're looking for and that's what this company has given us." It is one of a few companies in south Wales specialising in similar technology. The DSTL is also working with Tata Steel in Port Talbot to develop advanced metallic armour. Manufacturing was once a major employer and source of prosperity in Wales but has faced steep decline. Mike Williams from Kennametal said: "To bring manufacturing industry to Wales is key at the moment. There's so much of it going the other way. "Hopefully, it builds a good foundation for us to grow even further." </body>

West Wales and the valleys qualifies for £2.1bn of new EU aid that must be matched by public or private cash. Projects in the region qualify for the money due to its poor economic performance. Ministers have said Wales must not "sit back and wait" before using the money, despite public spending cuts. But a leading academic has warned Wales risks being "left behind" as other traditionally poorer areas of Europe see far higher growth levels. Finance Minister Jane Hutt told BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme the EIB was "looking at ways they can help us, until we get our borrowing powers, in perhaps different ways to fund projects". "This is not a time to sit back and wait - we have to get on with the job, and the European Investment Bank is very keen to work with us on this," she said. The west Wales and the valleys area comprises Anglesey, Conwy, Denbighshire, Gwynedd, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire, Swansea, Neath Port Talbot, Bridgend, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Merthyr Tydfil, Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly and Torfaen. One scheme that could receive EIB loans is the South Wales Metro, an ambitious blueprint to link train and bus service across Cardiff and the valleys. Mrs Hutt has already announced £62m will come from the Welsh government for the project. The EU money is available from 2014-2020. West Wales and the valleys received around £1.9bn in 2007-13, and a similar figure in the previous seven years. Mrs Hutt denied the money had failed to have an impact. She said: "This is about transport links, it's about regeneration, it's about helping businesses with research and development. "You can give all the numbers but these young people who have had training, does it lead to jobs? That's the important test really of how we've used our (EU) funding and it has led to these young people getting jobs." But statistics collected by the EU suggested other areas had seen higher levels of economic growth after receiving similar funding to west Wales and the valleys. Dr Adrian Healy, from Cardiff University's School of Planning and Geography, told the programme: "Previous places which have had low GDP growth, low employment, productivity value similar to Wales - and west Wales and the valleys in particular - are seeing higher levels of growth and higher rates of growth over the last five, seven, 10 years and that puts west Wales and the valleys in a particularly difficult situation. "We have a low level of activity, and it's not getting much better in comparison to those other areas that might have been seen as being similar. There is a risk of being left behind, in that sense." The Conservative Aberconwy MP Guto Bebb said the money invested so far had not transformed the Welsh economy as hoped. "If you travel the length and breadth of Wales you will find examples of waste within European structural funds which should really make us feel very ashamed," he said. "You will find arts centres which have closed, cultural centres which have closed - all this investment in buildings which look very impressive but no funding in place to keep them running. "And rather than create an entrepreneurial spirit, European funding has actually contributed to the dependency culture we have as a country."

      <title>High-speed rail 'losers' revealed</title>
      <description>The local economies that stand to lose from the new north-to-south high speed rail link are revealed.</description>

      <body>The potential losses to some regional economies from the HS2 high-speed rail link have been revealed. HS2 would make more than 50 places across the UK worse off - such as Aberdeen, Bristol and Cardiff - research by KPMG suggested. The government said HS2's £17bn cost is part of a £73bn package of transport improvements in the next parliament. It claimed the measures would benefit areas which HS2 will not serve, long before the high-speed line opens. The 92-page KPMG report was released in September. Hailed by the government, it said the line could boost the UK economy by £15bn a year. It listed the regions it said would benefit, with Greater London (£2.8bn) and West Midlands (£1.5bn) the biggest winners. But, the extent to which regions not on the proposed line would be affected was only revealed following a freedom of information request passed to BBC Two's Newsnight programme. HS2 Ltd's chief executive has called the figures "unsurprising". Economic output would be worst affected, according to the research, in: James Bream, policy director of Aberdeen's Chamber of Commerce, said it was "really disappointing" that such a huge number was left out of the original report. He added the negative impact for the whole north-east of Scotland could be "significant to say the least." Dundee and Angus could lose as much as 2% of its annual GDP, KPMG found. Kettering, Suffolk West and Cambridgeshire East are all listed as zones that could see a 1% drop in GDP. The accountants used data from HS2 Ltd's assessment of the direct transport impacts of the scheme, which would connect London to Birmingham and to Manchester and Leeds. The Department for Transport said HS2 was vital to "rebalance the economy". A spokesman said: "These figures show it boosts the north overall more than the south. "Of course the line does not serve every city and region and these figures reflect that." The DfT say ultimately the line would reduce journey times to Edinburgh and Glasgow by an hour. KPMG said its report clearly shows the benefits of HS2 for some regions and the negative impacts it might have on others. A spokesman said: "Maps in the report show potential productivity gains would outweigh the potential losses and the benefits to the UK economy would be far greater than the negative impacts. "Newsnight did not contact KPMG prior to its programme. "If they had, we could have helped them understand how the underlying data is represented in the report we have produced." Professor Henry Overman from the London School of Economics - formerly an expert adviser to HS2 Ltd - told the BBC it was obvious that, as some cities, towns and regions reap the benefits of being better connected, other places away from the line will pay a price. "When a firm is thinking of where to locate, it thinks about the relative productivity of different places, and the relative wages etc," he said. "HS2 shifts that around. So if you are on the line that makes you a better place that hasn't had that productivity improvement." But Newsnight's political correspondent David Grossman said there were "questions about the robustness" of the data. The chief executive of HS2 Ltd, Alison Munro, said: "What this is showing is that the places that are on the high-speed network... those are the places that will benefit most from high-speed two. "But high-speed two isn't the only investment that the government is making. Over the next five years it is planning to spend £73bn on transport infrastructure." Richard Houghton, from campaign group HS2 Action Alliance, claimed the whole project is based on "voodoo economics". He said: "If I was sitting in one of the 50 areas set to lose out to the tune of millions of pounds, I would be asking very clear questions." PDF download HS2 FOI request[97kb] </body>

      <description>The lives and homes of thousands of people could have been put at risk because of poor management at a public body, a committee of AMs warns.</description>

      <body>The lives and homes of thousands of people could have been put at risk because of poor management at a public body, a committee of AMs has warned. The Caldicot and Wentlooge Internal Drainage Board is responsible for ensuring the Gwent Levels do not flood. The latest criticism follows a Wales Audit Office (WAO) report which said the board misused public funds. AMs said the findings did not reflect on the board's managers now. Its powers are likely to be transferred elsewhere. The Welsh government said it understands appropriate control measures are now in place at the board. The body, which is independent of government, manages drainage systems in an area of low-lying coastal land between Cardiff and Chepstow, south of the M4 and bordered by the Severn estuary. The WAO investigation into the board's 2010/11 accounts found irregularities in the way some senior staff had awarded themselves and others pay rises. It also had evidence that the board went on trips around Europe with "little or no" business case to justify their need. It said that in 2005, 37 people went on a £4,333 three-day inspection visit to Venice, including 13 staff and board members and 21 guests, mainly spouses or relatives. Another excursion to Northern Ireland for 28 people in 2008, which included a visit to a distillery and the Giants Causeway, cost more than £4,700. The Welsh assembly's public accounts committee said events at Caldicot and Wentlooge were "a prime example of how not to run a publicly-funded organisation". In a new report, committee chair Darren Millar AM said: "There were no clear lines of accountability for the board and it was not effectively monitored in developing and implementing a strategic plan for flood-risk management in the Gwent Levels. "We believe that this potentially put the lives and property of thousands of people at risk." The committee report concluded that "poor governance and accountability" led to staffing disputes and infighting at the drainage board. Mr Millar said: "Caldicot and Wentlooge IDB is responsible for managing the appropriate drainage for a strategically critical area of Wales, which encompasses major infrastructure, businesses, farmland and tens of thousands of homes. "The committee believes that the poor governance, accountability and transparency at the board had the potential to put all of that at risk." He also warned that the committee was concerned that the issues at the board may not be unique and urged Welsh ministers to remind other public bodies of their responsibilities. But Mr Millar said the board had taken action to address many of the issues highlighted by the WAO and the report's findings did not reflect on the current management team. There are three internal drainage boards currently operating wholly or mainly in Wales: Caldicot and Wentlooge Levels, which is wholly in Wales; Lower Wye, which is mainly in Wales and partly in England; and Powysland, which is also mainly in Wales and partly in England. Natural Resources Minister Alun Davies said he was now considering merging all three boards with environmental body Natural Resources Wales. In a statement to AMs, he said the issues raised about Caldicot and Wentlooge board do not "reflect the culture or standards of public service that we have a right to expect from any public body". "It is clear from the report that it lacked some of the necessary governance controls, checks and balances that a public body must possess," Mr Davies said "We have already consulted on the future of these bodies and in the consultation we made clear that our preferred option was to transfer the powers of the internal drainage boards to Natural Resources Wales. "I have considered responses to the consultation and have asked officials to look at the costs, benefits and risks of a transfer to Natural Resources Wales, alongside other options. "This work is well advanced, and I expect to announce my decision on the future of these boards in the next month." </body>

      <body>Cardiff manager Malky Mackay says referee Anthony Taylor made a "horrendous error" by allowing Eden Hazard's first goal to stand in his team's 4-1 defeat by Chelsea. Samuel Eto'o kicked the ball away when Bluebirds keeper David Marshall bounced it - a foul according to Fifa rules.  Mackay said: "He bounces the ball. It's a huge mistake. A horrendous error." Chelsea assistant first-team coach Steve Holland said: "The referee had a clear view and knows the rules." Cardiff were leading 1-0 at the time, following Jordon Mutch's goal. But, after Eto'o nipped the ball away from Marshall, Hazard slid home to level. And Mackay added: "At the time, I didn't see but I've been into see the referee. Our goalkeeper bounced the ball. He saw the player Eto'o there. The referee is saying that, at the time, he heard from his linesman that he dropped the ball. "He said immediately that if the goalkeeper bounces the ball, then it's a foul on him. "They've got it wrong between them and it's cost us. We've gone in 1-1 at half-time instead of 1-0." Eto'o, Oscar and Hazard each scored second-half goals but Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was sent off and refused to attend his post-match media conference. </body>

      <body>Wing Alex Cuthbert is a Wales injury worry ahead of the Autumn Tests after suffering an ankle injury in Cardiff Blues' win over Toulon. Cuthbert picked up the injury after 18 minutes of the 19-15 Heineken Cup win. The Lions wing continued until half-time but did not reappear for the second half and was seen leaving the Arms Park on crutches. "His ankle's a bit sore so we've just got to assess him," Blues boss Phil Davies said. Davies played down the injury and is confident 23-year-old Cuthbert would be available for Wales' November tests. "[There's] no major damage apparently, just more of a knock than anything which he couldn't shake off so we brought him off," Davies added. "We'll see how he is. He'll be fine for Wales I'm sure." Wales head coach Warren Gatland announces his squad for the November internationals on Tuesday. South Africa are Wales' first opponents at the Millennium Stadium on 9 November before Gatland's side face Argentina, Tonga and Australia. </body>

      <body>Ben Davies is set to miss Swansea's Europa League game against Kuban Krasnodar on Thursday with an ankle injury. The 20-year-old came off in the second half of the 4-0 win over Sunderland after twisting his ankle. Davies started for Swansea after missing Wales' matches because of a hamstring strain. Swansea boss Michael Laudrup said Davies will undergo an X-ray to determine the severity of the damage. "It's another ankle injury, we have already had a few," Laudrup said. "It is a twisted ankle, he fell in the first half so we agreed to let him start the second half but after two or three minutes you could see it wasn't good. "He will probably go for an X-ray, but I am not a doctor and we have to wait for the X-ray. "But I think he may be out for the next two games [against Kuban Krasnodar and West Ham] at least." Davies missed Wales' World Cup qualifiers against Macedonia and Belgium after suffering a hamstring injury in Swansea's 2-0 defeat at Southampton. Swansea captain Ashley Williams is also currently sidelined with an ankle injury and Laudrup is not prepared to rush the defender back. Williams was again missing as Swansea secured their first Premier League home win of the season with an emphatic 4-0 win against bottom side Sunderland. After a goalless first half an own goal by Phil Bardsley, Jonathan de Guzman's strike, a penalty from Wilfried Bony and a Steven Fletcher own goal secured Swansea's first league win at the Liberty Stadium since March. "In the Premier League it has been a while since we won at home," Laudrup said. "We have won all three of our home games in the Europa League, but this is our first of the league season. "We can always talk about who we have played against, and we have played three of the top teams here this season. "But when people start to talk it is good to turn it down immediately, and the only way to do that is by winning." </body>

      <body>A police officer has won a national bravery award after he risked his life to save a drowning teenager from a quarry in Carmarthenshire. PC Alun Morgan from the Dyfed-Powys force won the Police Federation prize at a ceremony in London. But despite his efforts in June 2012 at Cilrychen Quarry, Llandybie, 14-year-old Luke Somerfield died. PC Morgan was one of the first on the scene and dived into the water after hearing the screams of upset children. Luke, from Llandeilo, had been in Cilyrychen Quarry with three friends. An inquest into the teenager's death in August last year heard that he became tangled in rope from a lifesaving ring and drowned. A verdict of accidental death was recorded. PC Morgan and his colleagues arrived at the quarry to find it enclosed by an 8ft (2.5m) high chain-link fence, with two lines of barbed wire above and no obvious way to get inside or out. He cut a hole in the fence and asked a worker from a neighbouring engineering firm to cut the chains on the nearby gates so other emergency vehicles could get in. PC Morgan, a former lifeguard, then sprinted to the edge of the quarry lake and, after speaking to witnesses, he tied a rescue line to himself and dived 15ft (4.5m) down to rescue the boy. Luke later died in hospital. PC Morgan, who won the Welsh region police bravery award, said: "It was very tragic and it's bitter sweet to win this award. Sadly the little boy died but we did our best for him as a team. "You don't think about the dangers when you go in, adrenaline kicks in and you just do it. It's only afterwards you start to think about things. "I just wanted to get to the boy as quickly as I could and get him out. I'm very proud and I didn't expect it all." PC Morgan said the Luke Somerfield Memorial Trust had been set up in Luke's memory to educate youngsters about the dangers of water. Steve Williams, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: "Congratulations to PC Morgan for receiving the police bravery award for the Welsh region. "In very traumatic circumstances, knowing the risks involved and despite instructions not to, PC Morgan plunged into treacherous quarry waters. "He risked his own life, determined to save another. PC Morgan's bravery, endurance and dedication to duty cannot be underestimated." </body>

      <description>Fuel duty cut bid for rural areas leaves out Welsh communities</description>

      <body>An application for a 5p per litre cut in fuel duty in rural areas will not include anywhere in Wales. Only three towns in England and seven in Scotland passed the criteria for inclusion in the bid to the European Commission (EU). The cut already applies to Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly. Ceredigion's Liberal Democrat MP Mark Williams said he was disappointed but the price guide set by the EU was "very high". "I am very disappointed to see that Ceredigion, nor anywhere in Wales, has been included in the list of places in the UK which the Treasury will put forward to the EU for a fuel rebate," he said. "Having collected data from all of Ceredigion's petrol stations and submitted the evidence to the Treasury, the price guide set by the EU was very high, with some petrol stations in Ceredigion only reaching it on one or two days over the time frame set and others not reaching it at all. "Whilst this is disappointing, the Treasury needs the supporting data in order to make the case to the EU. "I remain convinced the prices we pay are disproportionately high and we must continue to make the case to the Treasury and the EU for the extension of this scheme." Seven of the towns for which the application is being made are in Scotland. They are Acharacle, Achnasheen, Appin, Carrbridge, Dalwhinnie, Gairloch and Strathpeffer. In England, Kirkby-in-Furness in Cumbria, Hawes in North Yorkshire and Lynton in Devon are included. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said that, as a Highlander, he knew "all too well that fuel prices tend to be highest in areas where a car is needed the most". "We've already delivered a tax cut for remote islands and now want to extend that to mainland rural areas that suffer from similarly high prices to the islands," he added. "We have put together the strongest possible evidence base to try and maximise the places that get it." A decision from the EC is expected next year. </body>

      <body>Twenty years ago, as England stuttered towards World Cup qualification failure under the haunted gaze of Graham Taylor, a technically inferior English football was readying itself for another harsh winter in Europe. Still struggling to overcome the effects of a five-year ban from European competition following the Heysel disaster - and despite the formation of the Premier League a year earlier - English clubs' prospects in Europe did not look good. Inaugural Premier League winners Manchester United would go on to be knocked out in the Champions League second round by Galatasaray. English football, more than ever, needed a spark. It got one from the most unlikely source. Norwich City, third-placed finishers in the 1992-93 season despite a negative goal difference, found themselves in Europe for the first time in their history thanks to Arsenal's FA Cup and League Cup double. The Canaries' expectations were not high. But after beating Dutch side Vitesse in the Uefa Cup first round, Norwich would go on to stun German giants Bayern Munich in the city's famous Olympic Stadium, an achievement to rank alongside the greatest - and most surprising - results in the history of British clubs abroad. It is a match, played on 19 October 1993, that is lodged firmly in the minds of a generation of football fans for the sheer unlikelihood of it all, as well as for John Motson's famous commentary line: "This is almost fantasy football." The fantasy football was played largely by Jeremy Goss, whose sublime volley gave the Canaries the lead en route to a 2-1 first-leg victory in Germany, a result followed by a 1-1 draw at Carrow Road, with Goss again the Canaries' scorer. "I can still feel the ball hitting my foot now," Goss says of his goal in Munich, capitalising on a poor defensive clearance from West Germany's World Cup-winning captain Lothar Matthaus. "It was such a sweet strike. "Luckily for me, I am remembered as the man who scored that goal against that team in that cup game. I had a couple of minutes in the big time of mass media exposure and I revelled in it, for the simple reason that it took so many years of hard work and disappointment to get to that level." Goss and his team-mates did not achieve their success against a poor Bayern side either. With Matthaus their lynchpin and Jan Wouters fresh from helping the Netherlands end England's World Cup dreams, the Bavarians would go on to win the Bundesliga title. Norwich, though, were undaunted by the task facing them - to become the first English team ever to win at the Olympic Stadium. "We thrived on the big stage," adds Goss. "We were desperate to play in the Olympic Stadium. The pitch was gorgeous - like a billiard table." That Norwich were the English team to flourish that year should perhaps not have been such a surprise. Led by manager Mike Walker, the Canaries introduced a continental sweeper system to their Premier League campaign, using the versatile Ian Culverhouse, flummoxing opponents at home and on the continent. In England, teams lined up as they had done for years, unable to fathom Norwich's tactics. Teams abroad were simply taken by surprise that a backwater English club had embraced such progressive ideas. "The Munich win wasn't a surprise to us - we were that confident and were playing so well in the Premier League at the time," says Goss, whose first-leg volley was followed by a Mark Bowen header. "The manager couldn't get us off the training pitch because we loved it so much. "It was just a terrific side. The belief, the strength and confidence I got in my game came from the people around me. There was Bowen's second goal, Ian Crook's fantastic crosses and goalkeeper Bryan Gunn's magnificent save in the dying moments of the game, when [Munich's Adolfo] Valencia had a free header." Gunn, City's first-choice goalkeeper from 1986 to 1998, recalls the shock among the players on the night. "The fact we were 2-0 up in the first 20 minutes… we were looking around at each other saying 'this is too easy'," he said. "We had read about things in the press beforehand - we were classed as country bumpkins. Whether that was lost in translation or not I don't know, but we went through and showed our steeliness. And it's an achievement that will never be surpassed now Bayern have moved to the Allianz Arena." Goss adds: "Bayern underestimated us. Lothar Matthaus, as captain of Germany, most certainly underestimated us. They couldn't cope with us; they couldn't cope with our work ethic. "In the press, Bayern said the first game was a fluke, and that the real Bayern Munich would turn up. Matthaus said Bayern would qualify." That, of course, did not happen, and the day lives on in the memory - both for the result and Motson's "fantasy football" line. "Fantasy football? I can't remember whether I said it because of the Fantasy Football television programme or not," Motson says. "I probably didn't. I suppose the fantasy was the fact Norwich were in that position at all. "After the Heysel ban it took a while for English clubs to re-establish themselves. I think you could say Norwich's run and their victory in Munich proved to be a stepping stone to English clubs being accepted again." The fantasy was short and sweet - Norwich were knocked out in the next round by Inter Milan, beaten 1-0 in both legs. But 20 years on, with England this time safely qualified for the World Cup finals and Manchester United well set in yet another Champions League group stage, they might want to give a nod to an unheralded Norwich City side who feared no-one and surprised everyone. </body>

      <title>Is shedding councils a way to save?</title>
      <description>Will cutting numbers save as much as people expect?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-24582160</url>

      <body>Councils the length and breadth of Wales are now trying to work out the best ways of dealing with unprecedented cuts. The option of reducing the number of local authorities, perhaps drastically, seems an obvious one. First Minister Carwyn Jones has again stated, in interviews with the BBC and the Western Mail, that 22 councils is too much, and he looks forward to seeing the recommendations of a commission considering the matter, which is due to report at the end of the year. Earlier this week, senior Cardiff councillor Russell Goodway suggested some councils could go bust as the impact of budget cuts mount, raising the prospect of the numbers falling regardless of any deliberate reorganisation. While Wales might not have been here before in terms of the scale of the financial cutbacks, the business of restructuring local councils is quite a well-trodden path. The current 22 councils were created in the mid-1990s. They replaced a two-tier structure made up of district and county councils, which had been established by another local government reorganisation in 1974. Two decades ago it was argued single, unitary authorities were more efficient - cutting out a layer of bureaucracy and making it simpler for people to understand who was providing their public services. No longer did one council empty your bins while another local authority educated your child. The argument was that if you had a complaint you knew where to go. Now it is said that many of these councils are just too small to deal with areas such as education and social services, although it isn't just the smaller authorities that have been criticised for the quality of their services in these two crucial areas. Prof Steve Martin and the team at Cardiff Business School's Centre for Local and Regional Government Research know a thing or two about these matters, having looked at evidence from council reorganisations around the globe. "Usually, when people undertake them, they hope for and anticipate quite significant cost savings," he said. "Studies in Australia, Canada and England show that whilst you can get cost savings, particularly in the longer term, they've never been on the scale that people have hoped for. "So one lesson, not to be too gloomy about this, is not to over expect in terms of cost savings." Prof Martin says it takes around five years for reorganisations to bed down. Restructuring which has taken place in England was slightly different from what might happen in Wales, involving two-tier authorities becoming unitary councils, but he says there was often evidence of a "performance dip" in the short term. So, while the savings can take time to appear, the hiatus of reorganising a council, turning it into a new organisation, people applying for their own jobs and so on tends to affect authorities' ability to run services as well as they might. "You overlay on that the very difficult financial environment that we're in at the moment and all of that says, therefore, that this is not something to be undertaken lightly." "Having said all of that, it's pretty clear that there are some authorities in Wales that have struggled in recent years, and the number of interventions that the government has initiated sort of bears testimony to that, and so does some of the performance data. "And therefore it would be wrong to say that we can be confident that the current 22 are performing as well as we might want them to". Yet Prof Martin says it isn't clear whether big, small or medium is the right size for a local authority. Some sizes are better for some services but not for others - one of the reasons why we used to have two different sizes of councils, in addition to community councils. "Do you want local government to continue to be responsible for education and social care - because if you don't then that drives you towards a pretty large number of small authorities - if you do there is quite a compelling case for a smaller number of larger authorities?" he said. Prof Martin reckons Wales is roughly the size of two or three large English county councils, in population terms, so does it makes sense for us to have 22 of them? "There are quite a lot of countries where governance is working quite well - some of the Scandinavian countries would have far larger numbers of councils which are smaller," he said. "But they are not responsible for education and social services - education and social services would be run by a higher tier of government - either a state-level government or the national government or county councils." Debating whether our local government structure is right or wrong has long been a past time for people like me who probably should get out more. Whatever is decided in Wales, the hope is that we won't be returning to these arguments soon after any changes are finally made. But it would take a braver man than me to bet on that being the case. </body>

      <title>Lebanese ex-hostages home from Syria</title>
      <description>Nine Lebanese pilgrims kidnapped in Syria last year return home to Beirut, after a hostage deal sees two Turkish pilots released in Lebanon.</description>

      <body>Nine Lebanese Shia pilgrims who were kidnapped by rebels in Syria in May 2012 have arrived back in Beirut a day after being released. The group were freed in a deal brokered by Qatar. Two Turkish pilots who were being held hostage in Lebanon were also released as part of the agreement. Turkish Airlines pilots Murat Akpinar and Murat Agca were seized in Beirut in August in a retaliatory abduction. They arrived in Istanbul on a Qatari jet on Saturday evening. A third part of the complex hostage negotiations involved the release of a number of female prisoners being held by the Syrian government. It is not yet clear whether that has taken place. The BBC's Dima Hamdan, at Beirut airport, says she understands the Syrian government was in the process of releasing an estimated 130 women detainees. The Lebanese group were released by their captors on Friday evening and driven to Istanbul, from where they flew to Beirut. There were jubilant scenes at Beirut's international airport as they arrived after a year-and-a-half in captivity to greeted by friends and family, as well as politicians and religious leaders. Speaking to local media, some of the men thanked the Qatari negotiators, Turkey and the Assad government for helping to free them. The nine were among 11 people seized while making their way back to Lebanon after a tour of holy sites in Iran. Two of them escaped. They were reportedly being held in northern Syria by fighters from a Sunni-based rebel group opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Then in August, the pilots were seized from a bus close to Beirut's international airport. A group called Zuwwar al-Imam Rida said it had carried out the kidnapping, and that the men would be freed in exchange for the pilgrims. It demanded that Turkey used its influence with Syrian rebels to make the swap possible. Turkey has consistently backed Syria's Sunni rebels, while much of Lebanon's Shia community supports President Bashar al-Assad. The pilots' abduction sparked protests in Lebanon, and growing concerns that the Syrian civil war is spilling over the border. Earlier this week they appeared in a video broadcast on Lebanese television saying they were both well and wanted to go home. Then on Saturday, Turkish state media announced that they were free and returning home. They were met on arrival in Istanbul by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other officials. Syrian and Lebanese politics have been deeply intertwined throughout the history of the two states. Syria had a large military presence in Lebanon for 29 years. It finally withdrew its soldiers in 2005, but has maintained a strong influence. </body>

      <title>Roma girl 'can return to France'</title>
      <description>A Roma girl whose deportation sparked protests can return from Kosovo to finish her studies, but her family cannot, French President Hollande says.</description>

      <body>French President Francois Hollande has said a Roma girl who was removed from her school bus and deported can return to finish her studies, but that her family cannot. Leonarda Dibrani, 15, was expelled along with her parents and five siblings earlier this month after they lost their battle for asylum in France. The case has sparked protests by student groups across the country. A government investigation ruled that the deportation had been legal. But the report, released on Saturday, said any future such action against school children should be taken outside school hours. The Dibrani family had been living in Levier, in the Doubs region of eastern France. They cited discrimination in Kosovo as grounds for asylum. An order for their expulsion was issued after they lost their battle for asylum. After two postponements, it was rescheduled for October and the father, who was detained in a different town, was expelled on 8 October. Leonarda had stayed at a friend's overnight so was not at the family home when border police arrived to deport them. She was instead taken away by police in front of other students while on a field trip. The whole family were flown back to Kosovo that day. Mr Hollande told French TV: "If she makes a request, because of the circumstances, and because she wants to pursue her schooling in France, a welcome will be extended to her." But he stressed that the invitation was to Leonarda alone. The girl has said she will not return to France without her family. "I will not abandon my family. I'm not the only one who has to go to school, there are also my brothers and sisters," the AFP news agency quoted her as saying. Leonarda's father, Resat Dibrani, told reporters in Mitrovica, where the family are now living, that they would not stay in Kosovo. "I have no freedom here for myself, my children and my family. The police can say whatever they want, but for me, justice does not work in France." But he said the family would not be split up by his daughter going alone. "Either we all go together or nobody goes." Mr Dibrani had admitted this week that he had lied about the children's origins in the hope of boosting their asylum application - only he is from Kosovo but his wife and six children were all born in Italy. The mayor of the Italian town of Fano, where the family lived for several years, said they left after the authorities there threatened to take the children into care. "The children hardly ever went to school even though he had signed them up. He sent them out begging. They lived in the streets," Stefano Aguzzi told AFP. "We told him that he could not continue living here without paying for anything. We gave him a set of rules for him to be able to stay." Mr Aguzzi said that if the family returned, Fano officials would "not welcome them back with open arms" but that would "consider them like we do all the other immigrants". Hundreds of French students have staged protests against the deportation, and the manner in which Leonarda was removed, in Paris and other cities. Much of the anger has been directed at Interior Minister Manuel Valls, previously a popular figure. The BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris says Mr Valls has also faced bitter recriminations from within his own party, accused of betraying the principles of the socialist government. But the government was also warned by the right-wing opposition that if it caved into the protests and allowed the family back, it would set a dangerous precedent, says our correspondent. Mr Hollande's invitation to Leonarda is perhaps the president's best way out of damaging few days, he adds. </body>

      <body>At least 10 people have been killed after a small tourist plane crashed near the city of Namur in south-east Belgium. It was carrying a group of skydivers and crashed shortly after take-off, killing all those on board, the local mayor has told the AFP news agency. The plane is thought to have taken off from the Temploux aerodrome and crashed around 10 minutes later in a field. Its wing appeared to have suffered some damage, Belgian media report. The small plane came down near the village of Marchovelette, 10km (six miles) from Namur. The passengers did not have time to jump out, the mayor of the nearby town of Fernelmont told AFP. Pictures show black smoke billowing from a burnt-out fuselage. "I just saw a plane lose its right wing in mid-flight and crash. I heard a massive 'bang' towards the south of Marchovelette," one witness told Belgian television. "I didn't see anyone escape with a parachute," the witness added. </body>

      <body>At least 16 people have been killed and more than 30 injured after a suicide bomber blew himself up in a crowded restaurant in the central Somali town of Beledweyne. The Islamist militant group al-Shabab has said it carried out the attack. The Somali government, backed by troops from several African countries, is fighting al-Shabab for control of the country. Al-Shabab said its target was Ethiopian and Djiboutian soldiers in Beledweyne. The bombing occurred at a tea shop popular with the troops in Beledweyne, 300km (185 miles) north of the capital, Mogadishu, close to the border with Ethiopia. "Our main target was Ethiopian and Djibouti troops who invaded our country," Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, al-Shabab's military operations spokesman, said. But witnesses, including a Somali MP in Beledweyne, Dahir Amin Jessow, have told the BBC that most of those killed were civilians. "There is a lack of medicine in the hospital and they can't cope with the flood of wounded patients, so we asked the central government to send us planes to evacuate patients," Mr Jessow said by phone. Al-Shabab militants have been driven out of Somalia's major towns, including Mogadishu and the key southern port of Kismayo, by a UN-mandated African Union force of some 18,000 soldiers. But the militants still control large parts of southern Somalia. Last month, the group claimed the attack on the Westgate shopping centre in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, in which 67 people died during a four-day siege. It said it staged the attack in response to Kenya's army carrying out operations on Somali territory. </body>

      <body>Tunisian security forces have killed at least nine suspected Islamist militants who are blamed for a deadly attack on a police patrol, officials say. They say at least three other suspects were arrested in the operation in the Mount Taouyer area, about 70km (44 miles) west of the capital, Tunis. Two policemen died when they were attacked in the area on Thursday. Interior Ministry spokesman Mohamed Ali Aroui said the militants belonged to the Salafist Ansar al-Sharia group. The group has been declared a terrorist organisation by the government and the interior ministry spokesman told reporters on Saturday that the three-day operation "has been a success". About two tonnes of materials used to make explosives were also seized. The killing of the two police officers led to an angry response from security forces when Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki, Prime Minister Ali Larayedh and other senior officials attended a memorial service for the men on Friday. The leaders were forced to leave the ceremony because of the hostility. Ansar al-Sharia has been blamed for the murders of two secular opposition politicians earlier this year. Their deaths also triggered mass protests against Tunisia's Islamist-led government. Several other militant groups - including al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb - also operate in the region. But the latest clashes were significantly closer to the capital than previous fighting with suspected Islamists. Since the popular revolt that sparked the "Arab Spring" in 2011, Tunisia has seen a rise in attacks by militants. A coalition led by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party was elected in 2011. But some government critics accuse it of being soft on hardline Islamist forces - charges it strongly denies. </body>

      <body>A court in Milan has banned Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's former prime minister, from holding public office for two years, following his conviction for tax fraud. However, the ban must be approved by parliament before taking effect. Earlier this month, a cross-party panel of the Italian Senate recommended his expulsion from the chamber. Berlusconi had threatened to topple the coalition government over the issue but backed down during a confidence vote. If he is expelled from the senate, he will lose his parliamentary immunity from prosecution in a string of criminal cases. He will also spend a year under house arrest, or doing community service - his preferred option, according to a request he formally submitted last week. The votes on his expulsion and ban on holding office are expected to take place within the next few weeks. Berlusconi, 77, was convicted over deals his firm Mediaset made to purchase TV rights to US films. He was sentenced to four years in prison, automatically reduced to one under a 2006 pardon act. He was also banned from holding public office for five years. The sentence was upheld in August. </body>

      <body>Greek police are trying to discover the identity of a young blonde girl who was found living on a Roma settlement with a family she did not resemble. DNA tests revealed the child, called Maria and aged about four, was not related to the couple she lived with. The little girl is now being looked after by a charity. Her photo has been released to help find her family. Officials believe she may have been a victim of abduction or child trafficking. Police are appealing internationally as the girl looks like she might be from northern or eastern Europe. The charity, Smile of the Child, told the BBC that the girl was frightened and neglected when she arrived in their care but that in overall good health and was now more relaxed. It said it had received many calls since the appeal was launched. A spokesman for the British couple Kate and Gerry McCann, whose daughter Madeleine went missing in Portugal in 2007, said the case gave them "great hope" that she would one day be found alive. Police raided the Roma camp, near Farsala in central Greece, to search for drugs and weapons. They noticed the lack of resemblance between the blonde-haired, green-eyed, pale-skinned little girl and her parents, and found further discrepancies when they investigated the family's documents. The couple had registered different numbers of children with different regional family registries. The woman claimed to have given birth to six children within a 10-month period. When questioned about how they came to have Maria, the couple gave "constantly changing claims," Thessalia Province Police Director Vassilis Halatsis said. "The girl might have been abducted from a hospital, or given up by an unmarried mother," the officer said. "So far we do not have a declared disappearance of a child of this age in Greece. Through Interpol, we will request assistance from the other European countries." The 39-year-old man and his 40-year-old wife have been arrested on suspicion of abducting a minor. The president of Smile of the Child, Kostas Yaaopoulos, said the girl was being used to beg on the streets. </body>

      <body>Opposition supporters in the Maldives have staged protests after police intervened to stop the presidential election from taking place. Police prevented ballot papers from being sent out on Saturday, saying two of the three candidates had failed to approve the registry of voters. The elections commission has accused the police of exceeding their mandate The Maldives has been in turmoil since ex-President Mohamed Nasheed was ousted in disputed circumstances in 2012. The first round of the election, held earlier this month, was won by Mr Nasheed, the Maldives' first democratically elected president. But that result was annulled and the second round of voting postponed amid allegations of electoral fraud, although international monitors said the process had been free and fair. Mr Nasheed has been leading the peaceful protests in the capital, Male. His supporters blocked a main road, drinking tea and eating snacks in a display of civil disobedience. Protesters spread out banners calling for the election to take place immediately and asking, "where is my vote". The current president, Mohamed Waheed Hassan - who had already pulled out of the leadership race after performing badly in the annulled first round - has proposed that the re-run be held on 26 October. "I hope that over that week, any outstanding problems will be ironed out," he told the Associated Press, saying he wanted to ensure a new president was installed before the end of his term on 11 November. The two remaining presidential candidates - Gasim Ibrahim and Abdulla Yameen - have been fighting for the re-run not to take place. Late on Friday, they sought an injunction against the election at the Supreme Court. They complained that they had not had time to endorse the registry of voters - a newly introduced requirement. The court did not issue an injunction but nor did it give a clear instruction for the election to go ahead. On Saturday, electoral commission head Fuwad Thowfeek said police had entered his offices and were stopping officials distributing election materials. Police spokesman Abdulla Nawaz said the election was stopped because the commission did not comply with a court order to have the voters' list endorsed by all candidates. But Mr Thowfeek accused them of exceeding their mandate. "We are very much concerned about what is going on in this country. The Supreme Court decision does not ask police officers to look into the voters' list and check what is there," he told reporters. The cancellation caused alarm among the country's international partners. India's foreign ministry said it was "seriously concerned at attempts to stall the democratic process", while a US embassy official in Sri Lanka said the delay "represents a real threat to democracy in Maldives". UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said he was "deeply dismayed" and called for the democratic process in the Maldives to be allowed to proceed. Commonwealth observers in the country also issued an angry statement denying suggestions by the police that they had sought Commonwealth advice before stopping the election. </body>

      <body>A commuter train in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, has crashed at the end of the line, leaving at least 80 people injured. The train failed to stop as it arrived at Once station, crashing through the buffers and ending up wedged between the floor and ceiling of the platform. The accident happened at the same station where 51 people were killed in a similar crash last year. The cause of the accident remains unclear. Saturday's crash happened shortly after 07:00 local time (10:00 GMT). The line from Moreno 40km (25 miles) west of Buenos Aires to Once station, operated by the Sarmiento train company, is normally a busy commuter line during the week, and its trains are usually packed with passengers. Security Secretary Sergio Berni said some of those injured on Saturday had been waiting on the platform and were hurt by flying glass as the train's windows shattered. Jorge Ramirez, a chef who got on the train nine stations before the end of the line, told the AP news agency the accident was "a tragedy". "I saw people hurt, shouting, others thrown on the floor. The people in the first wagon ended up piled on top of each other," he said. After the 2012 crash, the authorities revoked a local company's right to operate trains on the line and pledged to make new investments in safety. But commuters complain of frequent delays and bad service, and it is not uncommon to see travellers crammed into trains on their way to work, says the BBC's Ignacio de los Reyes in Buenos Aires. </body>

      <body>Australia's military is investigating whether a training exercise using explosives may have started one of the huge bush fires burning in the state of New South Wales. The exercise took place at a base near the town of Lithgow in the Blue Mountains region on Wednesday. It was the same day that a massive bush fire - which is still burning - began. About 200 homes have been destroyed in dozens of fires which have been burning for several days. The BBC's Jon Donnison in Sydney says this year's fires have come unusually early after unseasonably hot weather, and many are fearing a long and dangerous summer. One man has died - possibly of a heart attack - while trying to protect his home. The Australian Defence Force issued a statement about the fire burning between Lithgow and Bilpin, some 80 km (50 miles) north-west of Sydney, which is reported to have burned through 30,000 hectares (74,000 acres) and destroyed properties. It said it was investigating the circumstances of the fire, which began on defence land. "The fire started on 16 October, the same day that defence personnel were conducting an explosive ordnance training activity," the statement said. "Defence is investigating if the two events are linked. "Our thoughts are with those who have lost property or whose property is threatened by these devastating fires." Firefighters have been trying to make the most of a relatively cool day to tackle about 20 fires that are burning out of control, but higher temperatures and strong winds are expected to create difficult conditions in the coming days. New South Wales Rural Fire Service Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers said Saturday's conditions were a "pause", but that the fire perimeter stretched for more than 500km. "We're by no means out of the woods," he told broadcaster ABC. "It's just calmed down a little bit and obviously we're bracing ourselves for these worsening conditions." Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said some of the fires were so large they would take some time to completely extinguish. "Firefighters will be working on these fires for weeks," he said. "It's all about reducing the risk of these fires to breach containment lines and run under hotter, drier, windier condition over coming days." Smoke and ash from the wildfires have blanketed the Sydney skyline. Send your pictures and videos to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or text them to 61124 (UK) or +44 7624 800 100 (International).

      <body>A car bomb has exploded outside a military intelligence building in the Egyptian city of Ismailiya, north-east of Cairo. The Egyptian army said six soldiers were injured in the blast, which destroyed part of the building's wall and set fire to several cars. A second car bomb was found in the area, but experts managed to defuse it, AFP quoted officials as saying. Witnesses said they had heard loud gunfire around the time of the blast. Ismailiya and nearby areas have seen regular attacks on the police and military personnel by Islamist militants. The military has been carrying out a wide-ranging operation against militants in the Sinai Peninsula. Police and army troops have cordoned the area for security checking. </body>

      <body>Criminal charges are being considered against a US scout leader who toppled an ancient rock formation in Utah, sparking an international outcry. Glenn Taylor was filmed by a colleague pushing the 170 million-year-old red rock in Goblin Valley State Park and celebrating afterwards. The two scouts say they have received death threats after the video was posted online. The two men argue the rock was loose and could have fallen on a passer-by. Utah State Parks spokesman Eugene Swalberg said the state authorities were considering bringing the charges after the incident. "This is not behaviour that is appreciated or should exist in state parks," he told the Deseret News. "This has been formed for literally millions of years, and it's supposed to last for a long time. It doesn't need individuals doing the work of Mother Nature." The Boy Scouts of America - who have millions of members across the country - also condemned the action, warning that it would take "appropriate" measures. The scout leaders said the stone was pushed over because of safety concerns. However, scout leader Dave Hall told the Salt Lake Tribune: "I think we made the right decision, but probably the wrong method. "We take full responsibility for whatever mistake we made, and we're open to whatever that means from the state, from the Boy Scouts' office, etc." In the video, Mr Taylor is seen congratulating a colleague after the mushroom-shaped sandstone rock - known as a "goblin" - was toppled. </body>

      <description>Hoffenheim launch a protest after Bayer Leverkusen's Stefan Kiessling heads the ball through a hole in the net.</description>

      <body>Hoffenheim are set to protest against a freak goal awarded to Bayer Leverkusen when Stefan Kiessling headed the ball through a hole in the side of the net. Referee Felix Brych failed to spot that Kiessling's header flew wide of the post in the 70th minute of Leverkusen's 2-1 Bundesliga win on Friday. Hoffenheim managing director Alexander Rosen said: "It's a scandal. "That was no goal, there are no two ways about it. We are definitely going to protest." Brych, a Fifa referee, said that no player had indicated it was not a goal. "I had a slight doubt but the reaction from the players was clear - nobody was against [the decision]," Brych said. "I checked with Kiessling. But no-one, not even him, said that it wasn't a goal. The ball was in the net and for everyone on the pitch it was a legitimate goal." Meanwhile, goalscorer Kiessling has apologised saying he could "fully understand the reactions" to the goal on his Facebook page.   "After seeing the replays on television, I can clearly see that it was not a legitimate goal," he said. "During the game, after heading the ball and turning my head, I did not exactly see whether the ball had gone into the goal or not. Somehow, the ball was lying in the goal and I said exactly that to the referee. "I'm sorry for all sports fans. Naturally, it's not nice to win like that. Fairness is important in sport, for us in the club and for me personally." In April 1994, Bayern Munich beat Nuremburg 2-1 after defender Thomas Helmer was awarded a goal despite the ball not going in. Nuremburg lodged a complaint, and Germany's Football Association ordered a replay, which Bayern won 5-0 on their way to clinching the title. Hoffenheim coach Markus Gisdol said: "It's definitely bitter for us and something like this has already happened once, and that game was replayed so I think we're going to see this game again. "Anything else would be a joke. You can't replay a Bayern Munich game, but not a Hoffenheim game." Several Hoffenheim substitutes raced behind the goal to examine the netting and appeared to try to point out Brych's error. But the referee was by then powerless to overrule his original decision. Rudi Voller, Leverkusen's sporting director, said: "That's not how we wanted to win the game. The fair result would have been a 2-2." Leverkusen were leading through Sidney Sam's 26th-minute opener when the controversy happened. Germany international Kiessling headed a corner wide of the near post, and could be seen turning away in frustration before Brych awarded the goal. The referee then awarded Hoffenheim a generous penalty when Roberto Firmino was fouled a foot outside the penalty area. But Firmino's spot-kick was saved. Sven Schipplock pulled a goal back for Hoffenheim two minutes from the end, but they could not save a point and fell to their first home defeat of the season. Brych, who refereed England's 3-2 friendly win over Scotland at Wembley in August, sent off Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic during a 2-0 Champions League defeat away to Romanian side Otelul Galati in October 2011. The win took Sami Hyypia's side top, although Bayern Munich can overtake them by beating Mainz on Saturday. </body>

      <body>Two convicted murderers freed from prison with forged paperwork dutifully went to a jail to register as felons several days after their release. Florida officials are searching for Joseph Jenkins and Charles Walker, both 34, who were serving life sentences. Prison officials said they will tighten up their early-release policy to ensure there is no repeat of the blunder. The falsified documents were not identified until several weeks after first convict's release. It is not clear who made the bogus release documents, or if the escapes were related. Jenkins walked free on 27 September and registered three days later at a jail in Orange County, Florida, about 300 miles (480km) from the prison where he was serving his sentence. Walker was set free on 8 October from the same prison and registered on 11 October. The two prisoners apparently signed on to keep up the ruse that they had been released early by a judge. Released felons are required to register as they re-enter the public, otherwise a warrant is issued for their arrest. The registration process includes fingerprinting, images of which are uploaded to Florida police records. A deputy at the jail verifies that felons do not have any outstanding warrants, according to jail spokesman Allen Moore. Release documents bearing the forged signature of a sitting judge were processed through standard channels this autumn, officials have said. Authorities received release orders bearing the faked signature of Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry, printed on Ninth Judicial Circuit letterhead. The fabricated documents were processed by the Orange County clerk's office and sent to the Department of Corrections, which co-ordinated the inmates' release from Franklin prison in the city of Carrabelle, in the north of the state. Sheriff's office spokesman Angelo Nieves told reporters: "This shouldn't have happened, but it did, and our concern is to get these individuals into custody." Judge Perry said there were several red flags that should have alerted the court clerk's office or the corrections department, notably, how rare it is for a sentence reduction to come from prosecutors. On Friday, Florida Corrections Secretary Michael Crews said prisons will now verify with judges, not just court clerks, before releasing prisoners early. Authorities have been reviewing other releases based on modified court orders received from Orange County, to ensure no other inmates had been prematurely freed. Jenkins was serving a life sentence for the 1998 shooting death of a father of six during a botched robbery. Walker was sentenced to life in prison for the 1999 shooting death of a 23-year-old man. Walker said he did not mean to kill the man but fired three shots in warning because the man had been bullying him. </body>

      <title>Former US House Speaker Foley dies</title>
      <description>Former Democratic US Speaker of the House of Representatives Tom Foley, credited with reaching across the aisles in a more bipartisan Congress, dies.</description>

      <body>A former US Speaker of the House of Representatives who was credited with reaching across the aisles in a less bitterly divided Congress has died. Tom Foley, 84, died of complications from a stroke on Friday, his wife said. Born and raised in the north-western US state of Washington, the Democrat served in the House for 30 years and was speaker from 1989-1995. "America has lost a legend of the United States Congress," President Barack Obama said in a statement. "Tom's straightforward approach helped him find common ground with members of both parties," Mr Obama said. As speaker, he was an active negotiator in the 1990 budget talks that led to President George HW Bush breaking his pledge to never raise taxes. "Tom never got personal or burned bridges," Mr Bush said on Friday. "We didn't agree on every issue, but on key issues we managed to put the good of the country ahead of politics." Foley also allowed the House to vote on the resolution that approved the 1990 Iraq war, despite his own personal reservations and the objections of many fellow Democrats. "He granted our request for a vote because it was the right thing to do," Bob Michel, the Republican minority leader at the time, said. "He was that kind of leader." But Foley became the first House Speaker to be ousted by voters in his own constituency - as opposed to through a majority change in the chamber or a no-confidence vote from his own party - since the US Civil War. He was defeated by 4,000 votes in November 1994 by Spokane lawyer George Nethercutt, a Republican who supported term limits, which Foley had long fought. That was the year of the so-called Republican revolution led by Newt Gingrich, who became House Speaker in 1995. On Friday, the current House Speaker, John Boehner, called Foley "a model for any speaker or representative". "Tom Foley endeared himself not only to the wheat farmers back home but also colleagues on both sides of the aisle," Mr Boehner said. After leaving the House, Foley served as US ambassador to Japan for four years. </body>

      <title>Fire burns tonnes of sugar in Brazil</title>

      <body>A fire in Brazil's largest port has burnt some 180,000 tonnes of raw sugar, damaging six warehouses and pushing international prices to a one-year high. The authorities in the port of Santos said it took six hours to bring the fire under control. The cause of the blaze is still being investigated. Brazil is the world's main sugar exporter, accounting for nearly half of international sales. The terminal affected by the fire belongs to Brazilian sugar giant Copersucar. Four other sugar terminals are operating normally, port authorities said. Analysts say Brazil has enough port capacity to carry on with its usual export levels. "International markets react because they know there will be a temporary drop. But other terminals will certainly make up for the accident," sugar market analyst Plinio Nastari told Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper. Sugar prices in New York future markets went up by 6% when news of the fire broke, dropping later in the day. Port authorities said that the fire began at around 06:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on a conveyor belt taking raw sugar into one of the warehouses. They say this is the biggest fire in the history of the port of Santos, which exported 12.8 million tonnes of sugar in the first eight months of the year. The port is located some 80km (50 miles) from Sao Paulo. It was the gateway for much of Brazil's coffee exports in the 19th and 20th century and also the main point of entry for millions of European immigrants who arrived in Brazil until the 1950s. </body>

      <body>The Venezuelan government has denied reports that rescue teams have have retrieved the remains of Italian fashion heir Vittorio Missoni and four other people from the Caribbean. They were in a small plane carrying six people that plunged into the sea shortly after taking off from the Los Roques islands in January. The wreckage was found in June at a depth of 70m (230ft). Rescue teams have been carrying out searches in the area for several days. Venezuelan Attorney General Luisa Ortega issued a statement saying that she was going to meet relatives arriving in Caracas to update them on the rescue mission. El Universal newspaper, Italian media and news agencies reported on Thursday that the bodies of the four passengers and the co-pilot, Juan Carlos Ferrer, had been found. They are still looking for the remains of the Venezuelan pilot, German Marchant, according to those reports. But El Universal has now said that rescue teams working north of Los Roques have not yet retrieved the bodies. Mr Missoni and his wife, Maurizia Castiglioni died in the crash alongside two Italian friends who were holidaying with them in the Venezuelan archipelago, Guido Foresti and Elda Scalvenzi. The twin-engine aircraft disappeared on 4 January. Mr Missoni was the son of the late founder of the Italian Missoni fashion house, Ottavio Missoni, and co-owned the firm with his siblings. A piece of luggage from the aircraft was found off the Dutch island of Curacao, about 320km (200 miles) west of Los Roques, later that month. Los Roques, an archipelago made up of dozens of islands some 95 miles (150km) off Venezuela's coast, is one of the area's most popular holiday destinations. </body>

      <body>President Alpha Conde's ruling party in Guinea took just under half of the seats in last month's parliamentary poll, electoral officials have said. They said the Rally of the Guinean People (RPG) secured 53 seats in the 114-member parliament. The main opposition party had 37 seats, while the rest went to smaller parties. The opposition said it would not recognise the result of the poll, which international observers said was marred by "irregularities". Opposition spokesman Sydia Toure said the announced result of the 28 September election did not reflect "the people's vote". Earlier, the observers said that "breaches and irregularities were observed in a certain number of constituencies, preventing a significant number of votes from being taken into account". The monitors included representatives from the UN, EU, West African block Ecowas and US and French diplomats. The election in the west African nation is intended to replace a transitional parliament that has run the nation since military rule ended in 2010. The run-up to the election was hit by violence, as well as ethnic and religious tension. It has been much delayed and was supposed to be held six months after the 2010 presidential elections, which Mr Conde narrowly won. </body>

      <body>The Malian authorities say 72 people are now known to have died when a boat capsized a week ago on the River Niger. Rescuers found the bodies of dozens more passengers after the boat was refloated, Mali's Security Minister Sada Samake said. He said 210 people survived the accident, in which the vessel broke up near Konna whilst en route north from the town of Mopti to Timbuktu. Eyewitnesses had said the boat was overloaded with cargo. "The rescue teams have been able to bring it to the surface," General Samake announced in a press conference reported by the French news agency, AFP. He said 72 had died, and there were 210 survivors, of whom 11 were lightly injured. Officials had previously said 39 people died in the accident. He thanked the French military for its help in providing a medical team after the accident. The boat broke at the stern on a branch of the river near the village of Koubi. Speaking at the same press conference, Mali's Planning Minister, Abdoulaye Koumare, said the government was introducing new safety measures to prevent a repeat of such a tragedy. "In the future, these canoes will have to be equipped with life vests, fire extinguishers and lights for night-time navigation," he said. An investigation into why the large dugout capsized is still under way. Eyewitnesses had said the boat collapsed because it was overloaded with cargo. Local residents said many of the passengers would have been schoolchildren returning to the north for the start of their new academic year. Many Malians opt to travel by water, often in rudimentary canoes, due to poor road conditions in the north and the relatively high cost of overland travel. Over 4,000km (2,500 miles) long, the River Niger connects landlocked Mali's arid north with the more fertile south. </body>

      <body>American jazz star Patti Austin has cancelled a concert in Beijing after suffering "a severe asthma attack". A statement on the singer's website said Ms Austin was unable to perform at Forbidden City Concert Hall on Friday night "due to health problems". While the cause of her illness has not been confirmed, it comes at a time of growing concern over air pollution levels in the Chinese capital. The city has recently announced measures to combat worsening pollution. They include taking half of the city's four million private cars off the roads on days when there are serious levels of pollution. The system will be based on a vehicle's licence plate - odd numbers will be allowed on the roads one day, even numbers the next. A statement on Patti Austin's website said: "She was taken in an emergency to the Peking Union Medical College Hospital this morning where she has been treated for a severe asthma attack in combination with respiratory infection. "Ms Austin is currently resting in her hotel. Her current breathing condition does not physically enable her to perform tonight. "Ms Austin is extremely disappointed about this situation since she was very much looking forward to performing." The new anti-pollution system will give out four different degrees of air pollution warning - blue, yellow, amber and red. On days when an amber warning is given, factories will stop production and work will be halted on construction and building sites. Restaurants which offer an open-air barbecues will be ordered to close temporarily, and fireworks will be banned throughout the city. When a red warning is issued, the new car restriction measure will be implemented. Schools and kindergartens will also be closed. The measure to restrict the number of private cars from using the road is proving to be controversial. Critics have aired their concern that those who can afford to buy two or more cars will able to drive any day when the restriction is in force. Beijing has almost 21 million permanent residents, according to official estimates. </body>

      <body>The mayor of China's eastern city of Nanjing has been sacked, state media say, amid a crackdown on corruption. Ji Jianye was dismissed from his leadership positions for "suspected serious disciplinary violations", Xinhua news agency said. It comes two days after the ruling party's corruption watchdog revealed Mr Ji was under investigation. The anti-corruption drive was launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping after he took office in November last year. He warned that public anger over corruption threatened the survival of the Communist Party, and promised to pursue "tigers" - top-level officials - as well as "flies". Correspondents say Mr Ji appears to be one of the most senior targets of the campaign to date. No details of the case have been revealed, however, state-backed newspaper the 21st Century Business Herald said Mr Ji was investigated over economic corruption and construction projects. A report on Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily said Mr Ji's case could involve about 20m yuan ($3.3m, £2m) in funds. Several high-profile officials have been dismissed in recent months, including the former railways minister and a top economic planner. A number of senior PetroChina executives are also under investigation. Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu province, is home to about seven million people. Mr Ji has been mayor of Nanjing since January 2010 and was also the city's deputy party secretary, Xinhua said. </body>

      <title>Spain party treasurer 'sent cash'</title>

      <body>The former treasurer of Spain's ruling Popular Party says he handed thousands of euros in slush fund payments to the party's secretary general. Speaking by video link from jail, Luis Barcenas said he had given two envelopes with 7,500 euros (£6,350; $10,300) to Maria Cospedal in 2008. Ms Cospedal - who is suing Mr Barcenas for defamation - denied the claim. Mr Barcenas is in custody pending trial over corruption claims. The scandal has rocked the party and angered Spaniards. The former treasurer was giving evidence to a court in Toledo on Friday. He claimed he had personally delivered the cash to Ms Cospedal. Mr Barcenas added that the slush fund payments were a PP tradition. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy earlier this year denied the claim. He also said allegations that he had personally received illegal payments were "lies and manipulations". The Barcenas affair sparked widespread anger in Spain, hit by a double-dip recession and high unemployment. In July, clashes erupted between anti-government protesters and police after more than 1,000 people gathered outside the PP headquarters in Madrid, calling on the government to resign. The scandal originated in a 2009 judicial investigation into corrupt payments involving PP members. In January this year, El Pais newspaper published an list it said showed illegal payments to party members that had been signed off by Mr Barcenas. The former party treasurer says he made numerous bonus cash payments to Mr Rajoy and other senior party members out of the slush fund of donations by businesses. In response, they have accused the ex-treasurer of trying to blackmail them. The PP was handed a clear mandate by Spanish voters at the end of 2011 and as a result Mr Rajoy and his party enjoy a clear majority in parliament. The corruption allegations coincide with Spain's worst economic crisis for decades, and have threatened to destabilise government attempts to shore up public finances and bring the recession to an end. </body>

      <body>The US has agreed a deal with Romania to use an air base there as a transit point for American forces leaving Afghanistan, officials have said. The agreement was reached at bilateral talks at the Pentagon. The move will allow the US to switch its flight operations to Romania from Kyrgyzstan's Manas air base, when the US lease there expires in July 2014. Washington plans to withdraw most of its 52,000 troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014. The US wants to keep a smaller force in the country after the deadline, but is still negotiating key details with the government in Kabul. The deal about the use of Romania's Mihail Kogalniceanu air base was agreed during the talks between US Secretary of Defence Chuck Hagel and Romanian Defence Minister Mircea Dusa. In a statement, Pentagon spokesman George Little said Mr Hagel "praised this agreement, which is particularly important as the US prepares to wind down transit centre operations at Manas". "Secretary Hagel highlighted this agreement as a further testament to Romania's steadfast commitment to the Isaf (International Security Assistance Force) mission and its commitment to regional and international security." However, the details of the deal were not released. The base is near the Black Sea town of Constanta. In June, Kyrgyzstan's parliament voted to end the US lease on Manas in July 2014. The US pays $60m (£39m) each year to lease the base, which has been in operation since 2001. Russia also has an air base in Kyrgyzstan, for which it agreed a 15-year extension last year. </body>

      <title>UN calls for urgent Syria ceasefire</title>
      <description>The UN's humanitarian chief calls for an immediate ceasefire in the Damascus suburb of Moadamiyah to allow for aid delivery and evacuations.</description>

      <body>The UN's humanitarian chief has called for an "immediate pause in hostilities" in Moadamiyah, a rebel-held suburb of the Syrian capital, Damascus. Valerie Amos said 3,000 people were evacuated last Sunday, but that the same number were trapped in the town amid continuing shelling and fighting. Thousands of people were in a similar situations in towns across the country, she said. The army has previously said rebel-held areas must surrender or starve. Also on Saturday, activists said at least 16 soldiers were killed in a suicide bombing and fighting at a checkpoint near the mainly-Christian area of Jaramana. State media blamed "terrorists" for the explosion but did not give details. Rebels control much of the countryside around Damascus but Jaramana - a Christian and Druze area mostly loyal to President Bashar al-Assad - is still held by the government. In a statement, Baroness Amos said was "extremely worried by the situation unfolding across Syria where ordinary women, children and men are facing horrific violence and brutality from all sides of the conflict". She said relief workers had been unable to access Moadamiyah for months, and that the ongoing conflict was preventing any rescue mission from going ahead. "I call on all parties to agree an immediate pause in hostilities in Moadamiyah to allow humanitarian agencies unhindered access to evacuate the remaining civilians and deliver life-saving treatment and supplies in areas where fighting and shelling is ongoing," she said. But she said this was not the only area of concern, citing Nubil, Zahra, old Aleppo town, old Homs town and Hassakeh as other places where people were in danger. "Civilians must be allowed to move to safer areas without the fear of attack," she added. "It is vital that all parties to the conflict respect their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian laws to protect civilians and to allow neutral, impartial humanitarian organizations safe access to all people in need, wherever they are in Syria." Moadamiyah and at least two other Damascus's suburbs - Yarmouk and Eastern Ghouta - have been besieged by government forces for several months. The situation has become so desperate that earlier this week Muslim clerics issued a religious ruling allowing people to eat cats, dogs and donkeys just to survive. Those animals are usually considered unfit for human consumption in Islam. Syrian activists say they are now starting to record the first deaths of complications caused by malnutrition. On Friday, the US urged the Syrian government to allow relief convoys to reach starving civilians. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki warned that "those who are responsible for atrocities in the Damascus suburbs and across Syria must be identified and held accountable". More than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria's conflict, now in its third year. The unrest began in the midst of the Arab Spring regional uprisings, with protests against President Bashar Assad, before degenerating into civil war. A British surgeon who volunteered in a hospital in northern Syria for five weeks told the BBC on Friday that he had treated pregnant women deliberately targeted by snipers. David Nott said there "was definitely a game going on between the snipers". "One day we would receive patients who had purely groin wounds, another day purely chest wounds or purely abdominal wounds. Then another day full-term pregnant ladies were coming in having been shot." Most of the unborn babies and many of the women did not survive, he said. International efforts to halt the violence have consistently faltered, but last month the UN Security Council broke its deadlock, voting unanimously to adopt a binding resolution on ridding the country of chemical weapons. The move followed international outrage at a chemical weapons attack near Damascus in August. UN experts are currently working in Syria, inspecting chemical weapons sites and destroying the arsenal, and say they have completed almost half their mission. </body>

      <body>At least 16 Syrian soldiers have been killed in a suicide bombing and fighting that followed in a Damascus suburb, activists say. The blast triggered clashes at a checkpoint near the mainly-Christian area of Jaramana, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. State media blamed "terrorists" for the explosion but did not give details. Earlier, the US urged the Syrian government to allow aid to reach starving civilians in Damascus. Washington said the army's months-long siege left many people in rebel-held areas in desperate need of food, water and medicine. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of activists inside Syria, said the suicide car bombing by the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front triggered heavy fighting at a key checkpoint between Jaramana and the rebel-held town of Mleha. It said rebels fired rockets into Jaramana during the fighting and Syrian fighter jets retaliated by striking nearby opposition-held areas. The report could not be confirmed. The BBC's Jim Muir in neighbouring Lebanon says the use of suicide bombers to open an offensive is a tactic that has been used increasingly by the rebels in recent months. Rebels control much of the countryside around Damascus but Jaramana - a Christian and Druze area mostly loyal to President Bashar al-Assad - is still held by the government. In August a car bomb in the suburb killed 18 people. Syria's embattled President Assad has drawn support from Syria's ethnic and religious minorities, including Christians and members of his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam. The rebel movement is dominated by Sunni Muslims, who are a majority in Syria. In another development, British surgeon David Nott, who volunteered in a hospital in northern Syria for five weeks, has told the BBC he had treated pregnant women deliberately targeted by snipers. "There was definitely a game going on between the snipers," he said. "One day we would receive patients who had purely groin wounds, another day purely chest wounds or purely abdominal wounds. Then another day full-term pregnant ladies were coming in having been shot." He added: "They were definitely targeted in the uterus. The majority of the babies didn't make it." Mr Nott said he wanted the UK government to help open up a humanitarian corridor in Syria to allow aid and aid workers to enter the country safely. In a statement on Friday, US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki called on the Syrian government "to immediately approve relief convoys". She warned that "those who are responsible for atrocities in the Damascus suburbs and across Syria must be identified and held accountable". At least three of Damascus's suburbs - Yarmouk, Eastern Ghouta and Moudamiyah - have been besieged by government forces for several months. The situation has become so desperate that earlier this week Muslim clerics issued a religious ruling allowing people to eat cats, dogs and donkeys just to survive. Those animals are usually considered unfit for human consumption in Islam. More than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria's conflict, now in its third year.

      <body>A boy of 14 and an 18-year-old man have been arrested by police investigating three sexual assaults near the University of Manchester. Police had earlier released an e-fit if a boy, who they said could have been as young as 12, who they believed may have carried out the attacks. The police said they would continue to investigate the "appalling incidents" to establish who is responsible. Two of the assaults occurred on 21 September and the third on 5 October. In the first incident, a 27-year-old was approached from behind and grabbed in Lloyd Street North at 18:15 BST. The woman screamed and the offender, who was described as being in his mid-teens and mixed race, threatened her. He grabbed her again before running away. The next incident followed minutes later in Oxford Road when a 21-year-old woman was approached by a boy who made lewd comments as she left John Rylands library. She carried on walking on Moss Lane East and was sexually assaulted by her assailant. The third attack took place at the Manchester Science Park in Lloyd Street North at about 14:15 BST on 5 October. A 32-year-old woman was using her mobile phone when she was approached by two young boys. She was sexually assaulted by one of the boys, who was described as being slim, Asian, wearing baggy trousers and carrying a rucksack, and aged about 12 or 13 years old. She pushed him away but he sexually assaulted her again before running off towards Pencroft Way with the second young boy, who was also described as being Asian. Det Ch Insp Colin Larkin said: "These crimes have shocked everyone and I am pleased to say that we have now made two arrests. "I would like to thank members of the public and the media for their support and the information they have provided and as a result, we are now in a position where two people are in custody and are being questioned. "However, we still remain in the early days of this investigation and there is still a lot of work to be done. I want to reassure the community that, whilst we have made arrests, we will continue to investigate these appalling incidents so we so can establish all the facts and who is responsible." He added that he would like anyone who has any more information about the three attacks or any other incidents to come forward. </body>

      <title>Salmond: 'Scotland's time is now'</title>
      <description>SNP leader Alex Salmond tells his party conference it is "time for independence" and that the case for voting yes will be made on 26 November.</description>

      <body>SNP leader Alex Salmond told his party's conference that it was Scotland's time to be independent. During his speech to delegates gathered in Perth, he also announced that the detailed case for independence would be published on 26 November. The long-waited white paper will come ahead of the referendum itself, on 18 September next year. Mr Salmond said: "We are Scotland's independence generation and our time is now." Scotland's first minister reckoned devolution had provided a "taste of independence", but the country was now ready to make its own decisions. Mr Salmond also told the 1,000 people gathered that, under independence the national minimum wage would rise at least with the level of inflation, to help people keep pace with the cost of living. And he urged bosses at the Grangemouth petrochemical refinery, which has been temporarily shut down due to a dispute with workers to "fire up the plant". At the same time he urged union officials to drop their threat of strike action. The SNP leader said the white paper would have two functions, the first being to set out what would happen between achieving a "yes" vote in the referendum and the first elections to an independent Scottish Parliament, in the spring of 2016. He went on: "It will therefore be clear that independence is not, at its heart, about this party or this administration or this first minister but about the fundamental democratic choice for Scotland - the people's right to choose a government of their own. "Secondly, the white paper will set out our vision for Scotland - the why of independence - the Scotland that we seek. "We seek a country with a written constitution protecting not just the liberties for the people but enunciating the rights of the citizen." Mr Salmond told the conference: "We will not wake up on the morning of 19 September next year and think to ourselves what might have been. "We will wake up on that morning filled with hope and expectation - ready to build a new nation both prosperous and just. "After almost a quarter of a century moving forward to this very moment - let us ask ourselves these simple questions: If not us, then who? If not now, when? "Friends - we are Scotland's independence generation - and our time is now." Mr Salmond said of a "yes" vote in the referendum: "It will be, above all, an act of national self confidence and national self belief. "We, the people of Scotland, have by far the greatest stake in its success." Mr Salmond said the devolved Scottish Parliament, established in 1999, had been used to enact policies, like the public smoking ban, free personal care for the elderly and a council tax freeze. He went on: "With just a taste of independence, we've been able to deliver fairer policies than elsewhere in these islands. "With a measure of independence on health, on education, on law and order we've sought to make Scotland a better place. "So, let's consider what we can achieve by extending our power over the things we don't currently control. "Our welfare system, our economy, our energy supplies, our international security. "Because there is no doubt that we are paying a heavy price for Westminster decisions." The first minister said Scotland had to move away from Westminster government decisions, which he said people north of the border did not want, from housing benefit welfare reforms - branded the welfare tax by critics - to Trident nuclear weapons on the Clyde. Mr Salmond said the national minimum wage, which was brought in by the UK Labour government and which benefits about 70,000 people in Scotland, had failed to increase in real terms in almost 10 years. The first minister said a fair work commission, established under independence by an SNP government, would be to set a minimum wage guarantee. He said: "This guarantee will ensure that the minimum wage rises at the very least in line with inflation. "Let us pledge that never gain will the wages of the lowest paid in Scotland fail to keep up with the cost of living." At the same time, Mr Salmond again challenged David Cameron to face him in a referendum TV debate - an invitation the Prime Minister declined after arguing the event should be between the leaders of the campaigns for and against independence. The SNP leader said: "Here's the deal prime minister - we'll publish the white paper then you and I must debate, prime minister to first minister. "The choice is yours - step up to the plate or step out of the debate." Turning to the Grangemouth dispute, Mr Salmond said it was time for an injection of "common sense" into the bitter row between its operator Ineos and the Unite union. Ineos says the site is losing £10m a month and will close by 2017 unless workers agree to a rescue package which includes a change in their terms and conditions and final salary pension scheme. Mr Salmond left the conference on Thursday to facilitate talks between the two sides, but no agreement has been reached, and the petrochemical plant remains closed. The first minister said the threat to Grangemouth grew the longer it was shut, saying: "To the union - drop any strike threat. To the management - fire up the plant and then negotiate against the background of a working facility, not one which is in mortal danger. Find common ground. "Let us be quite clear - Scotland wants to see Grangemouth operating and the people of Grangemouth working - fire up the plant and do it now." </body>

      <body>Google shares have topped $1,000 (£617) for the first time, jumping 13.8% on Friday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. Shares in the online giant closed 122 points up at $1,011.4, and have risen 42% since the start of 2013. Friday's share price rise followed the company posting a 36% jump in net profits to $2.97bn for the July-to-September period on Thursday. Google's revenues also beat forecasts with a 12% rise year-on-year. "We are closing in on our goal of a beautiful, simple, and intuitive experience regardless of your device," Google's chief Larry Page said in a conference call with analysts. The strong earnings report also helped other online companies, with Facebook shares adding 4.4% to a new high of more than $55. Amazon rose 3.4%. Google's market value is about $334bn, which is still well below Apple's $461bn. Google was floated in August 2004 at $85 a share, giving the company a market value at the time of $23bn. The company reported its quarterly earnings on Thursday after US markets had closed. Google said that paid-for clicks increased by a quarter during the July-to-September period, from a year earlier, the highest rate of growth in the past year. This offset an 8% fall in average cost-per-click, the price advertisers pay Google when consumers click on their ads. "We view solid paid clicks growth to be a good indicator of demand, driven by the continued shift to mobile," JP Morgan analysts said in a note. Several brokers have raised their share price target for Google on the back of the company's new initiatives to attract advertisers. In February, the company launched a service to help advertisers market through a mix of smartphones, tablets and desktop computers. And analysts believe there is still significant potential to generate revenues from its video-streaming website YouTube. YouTube-branded video-ads surged more than 75% in the quarter from a year earlier, with 40% of traffic now coming from mobile devices. "We estimate that Google's key YouTube asset generated approximately $4bn in revenue in 2012, positioning Google extremely well for the strong growth in video advertising," RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. Analysts at Jefferies said Google is best positioned to benefit from mobile devices with one billion activations of its Android system. Google sells applications and content through its Google Play store. </body>

      <body>Canada and the European Union have struck a free trade agreement aimed at boosting growth and employment. The deal will lower tariffs, streamline regulation, and cut red tape. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso agreed the deal at a meeting in Brussels on Friday. Mr Barroso said they had reached a "breakthrough in negotiations" to achieve "a great agreement for both the European Union and Canada". The deal still requires approval by parliaments and EU member states. Once approved, the agreement aims to make it easier for companies in Canada and the 28-member EU bloc to invest in and sell to each other. The European Union is Canada's second-largest trading partner behind the US. Mr Harper said the agreement was "the biggest (trade) deal our country has ever made". It will give Canada access to a market of some 500 million people in the EU, making it bigger even than the country's North American Free Trade Agreement signed with the US and Mexico. The European Commission expects the deal to increase bilateral trade in goods and services by a fifth to 25.7bn euros ($35bn; £21.7bn) a year. The commission is negotiating trade pacts with more than 80 countries on behalf of the bloc's members following the collapse of the Doha global trade talks. </body>

      <title>China's economic growth speeds up</title>
      <description>China's economic growth picks up pace in the July-to-September period according to officials figures - the first rise in three quarters.</description>

      <body>China's economic growth picked up pace in the July-to-September period, the first rise in three quarters. The world's second-biggest economy grew 7.8% from a year earlier, up from 7.5% expansion in the previous quarter. The official figures also showed growth in industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment. After years of blistering growth, China has seen its pace of expansion slow recently and there have been fears that growth may slow further. China has set a growth target of 7.5% for the year. Analysts said the latest numbers indicated that it was likely that Beijing would meet this. "This is an indication that China's economic growth is holding up in a range which is within the comfort zone of both the Chinese policymakers as well as global watchers," said Song Seng Wun, a senior economist with CIMB Research . Over the past few decades China has relied heavily on its exports and manufacturing sectors as well as government-led infrastructure spending to help boost growth. However, a slowdown in key markets such as the US and Europe has hurt demand for its exports. As a result, it has been trying to spur domestic demand to offset the decline in foreign sales and also to rebalance its growth. Earlier this year, it unveiled fresh measures to help boost the economy. From 1 August, China has suspend value-added tax (VAT) and turnover tax for small businesses with monthly sales of less than 20,000 yuan ($3,257; £2,125). The cabinet said the move would benefit more than six million small companies and boost employment and income for millions of people. Policymakers said they would also implement measures to simplify customs clearance procedures, cut operational fees and facilitate the exports of small and medium-sized private enterprises. The cabinet also announced plans to completely open China's railway construction market to private investors to develop the sector further. It said it would set up a railway development fund, with the initial money coming from the government. Analysts said the moves were starting to have an impact on the growth numbers. "There is certainly a build up of momentum among the small manufacturers, which is an indication that China's policies targeted at them are working," said Tony Nash, vice-president at IHS. Factory output rose 10.2% in September, from a year earlier. Meanwhile, retail sales rose 13.3% and fixed asset investment jumped 20.2% during the month from levels a year ago. Tim Condon of ING added that the measures may help China sustain its growth rate in the current quarter as well. "The mini-stimulus we've seen is enough to keep it going at this pace in the fourth quarter," Mr Condon said. However, there have been some concerns over whether the economic rebound is sustainable in the long run, not least due to the continued rise in property prices. Property prices have now risen for eight months in a row, despite government efforts to cool the market. Some analysts have said that China's new leaders, who took charge in March, have so far tolerated the price rises due to concerns over slowing economic growth. According to some estimates, about 25% of overall investment in China goes towards property, making it one of the most important growth sectors. But the continued surge in prices has fanned fears that asset bubbles may be forming. "Between real estate and the lending environment, there are concerns that things may be heating up," said Mr Nash of IHS. "If not addressed properly, and in time, it could pose a serious threat to China's growth." Analysts said that with growth rebounding, Beijing may take measures to try and curb speculation in the property market. "We think the recovery in the third quarter was mainly driven by the strong momentum of the property market," said Shen Jianguang, chief China economist with Mizuho Securities in Hong Kong. "The government concerns about an over-heated property market are increasing, and tougher measures to curb rising prices may be forthcoming. "We expect gross domestic product (GDP) growth will slow to 7.6% in the fourth quarter," he added. </body>

      <body>Manchester United manager David Moyes endured another afternoon of frustration as Southampton snatched a last-gasp equaliser to stun Old Trafford. Captain Adam Lallana tapped in from a yard out with only a minute of normal time remaining to give the visitors a share of the spoils and leave United eight points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal. The champions had looked on course for what would have been a ninth successive win over the Saints. Teenager Adnan Januzaj produced another moment of brilliance to set Robin van Persie on his way to put United in front midway through the first half. The hosts might have put the game beyond Southampton as both Van Persie and the excellent Wayne Rooney hit the crossbar. However Mauricio Pochettino's side will feel their dominance of possession more than warranted a point, even if they lacked a genuine cutting edge for long periods. For United, there had been signs that they were beginning to turn the corner after the club's worst start to a Premier League season. The movement and understanding between Rooney, Van Persie and Januzaj bordered on the telepathic. Even as Moyes's side were forced back for long periods of this game, the trio ensured this was a United side that bristled with attacking menace for all 90 minutes. Januzaj, 18, who signed a five-year contract before the game, once again displayed signs of his immense talent with a verve and energy that glowed throughout. His battle with Nathaniel Clyne was a feature of the first-half as Southampton plotted their passing angles with patience and precision, forcing United onto the back foot. Morgan Schneiderlin and Victor Wanyama pulled the strings in midfield, while the dynamism of Lallana meant Saints always had options, even if chances on goal were scarce. Jay Rodriguez headed over and Dani Osvaldo might have done better with only David De Gea to beat and, as Southampton bordered on the profligate, United were far more ruthless. Van Persie had twice gone close in the opening 20 minutes, before Rooney's sublime pass set him in on goal once more, only for an offside flag to deny him the chance to finish. However, the brilliance of Januzaj ensured United would not be denied for long. Picking the ball up in his own half, Januzaj threaded a 40-yard pass into the path of Rooney to slice Southampton open in the blink of an eye. Rooney's shot was brilliantly blocked by goalkeeper Artur Boruc, but Van Persie was quickly onto the rebound, rolling the ball beyond the despairing dive of Dejan Lovren to give United the lead. It was the first goal Southampton had conceded in almost seven hours of Premier League football but it came from a familiar source - this was Van Persie's fifth goal in as many appearances against Saints but his first for five Premier League matches. For a five-minute spell, Saints looked lost. Rooney rattled the crossbar with a thunderous shot but the visitors weathered the United storm and came again - Van Persie heading Lovren's header off his own line just after half-time. And yet, United always carried the greater threat. Their movement in attack constantly confounded Southampton's defenders, with Rooney, Van Persie and Januzaj swapping places and eluding markers at will. The Dutchman might have a second goal as he headed onto the crossbar on the hour. Moments later, Januzaj was in the thick of the action once more, unleashing a dipping, swerving left-foot drive that Boruc somehow clawed away. Though Southampton refused to lie down - Lallana testing De Gea with a low shot - hope appeared to be draining away. However, when Lovren forced Shaw's corner towards goal, Lallana got the faintest of touches to beat De Gea to earn Saints a point and extend United's poor league run to only two wins in seven matches. </body>

      <title>Italy stun England before World Cup</title>
      <description>England suffer a shock defeat by Italy only one week before the start of the Rugby League World Cup.</description>

      <body>England suffered a shock 15-14 defeat by Italy only one week before the start of the Rugby League World Cup. Josh Mantellato kicked a drop-goal 90 seconds from time to give Italy - at 13 the second-lowest ranked team in the World Cup - victory in Salford. England, ranked third in the world, trailed 12-4 at one stage in the first half before two Sam Tomkins tries put the home side ahead. But a Ray Nasso penalty and Mantellato's drop settled it. England meet Australia in the World Cup's opening match in Cardiff on 26 October. Italy, coached by Salford-born and raised Carlo Napolitano, deserved their victory as England failed to impress on a rain-swept afternoon. The only bright spot was provided by full-back Tomkins, who scored twice in the first half before watching his team-mates slump to defeat from the sidelines. Tomkins was taken off 16 minutes from the end as McNamara gave run-outs to 20 members of his World Cup squad. England floundered in a first-half rainstorm, which was accompanied by thunder and lightning, and were left to rue a series of early defensive lapses. McNamara would have been concerned at the way his defenders fell off the tackle to allow St Helens prop Anthony Laffranchi a soft early try and the ease with which hooker Dean Parata burrowed his way from dummy half for the visitors' second. In between those two scores, centre Carl Ablett notched England's first try in the 19th minute, touching down at the corner, despite juggling with the pass from Liam Farrell, after winger Ryan Hall had collected Kevin Sinfield's cross-field kick. As the storm clouds parted, Tomkins provided a spark for the hosts. He took James Roby's superb pass to score his first try and then got on the end of Gareth Widdop's lofted kick for his second. Sinfield was wide with his first conversion attempt and hit the post with his second - but his replacement Widdop found the target to convert Tomkins' second try and put England in front for the first time four minutes before the break. If the sight of a double rainbow at the start of the second half lifted the spirits of the spectators, it did nothing for England's players. They missed a scoring chance when Hall failed to take Gareth Hock's pass 10 metres away from the Italian line. And the Azzurri took the chance to draw level in the 69th minute with a penalty from in front of the posts by substitute Nasso. England had a chance to win it when Widdop broke clear with five minutes to go but he failed to find the supporting Rob Burrow and the missed opportunity proved costly. When Josh Charnley knocked on inside his own 20 metres, the Italians seized their chance and Mantellato was accurate with a 30-metre drop goal. Earlier, England Knights survived the scare of conceding an early try to beat Samoa 52-16, with Jack Hughes scoring a hat-trick. Elsewhere, Scotland were beaten 20-38 in a warm-up friendly against Papua New Guinea in Featherstone. Steve McCormack's side face Tonga in their World Cup opener in Workington on 29 October. The United States caused a shock by beating France 22-18 in Toulouse on Friday evening.

      <body>Stunned Chelsea fans found themselves sitting next to manager Jose Mourinho after the Portuguese was sent off during his side's 4-1 victory over Cardiff. Mourinho was ordered from the technical area by referee Anthony Taylor after protesting about apparent time-wasting. Chelsea assistant first-team coach Steve Holland said: "Jose was furious on the touchlines. "For an hour, we'd been frustrated by their clear time-wasting." Mourinho spent the final 20 minutes sitting among supporters behind the Chelsea dug-out, with one fan using Twitter to post a photograph of himself sitting next to the Blues manager. Holland added: "Jose is very frustrated. From the first minute, they took a long time to take every dead ball. "We mentioned it politely to the fourth official and referee. It was a deliberate ploy to break up the game. "That changed when we got ahead. They kicked the ball out for us to take a throw in. The ball boy went to get it, threw the ball to Ivanovic, missed, and so it was in the dug-out area. "Ivanovic had the ball in his hands for two seconds - and the referee was gesticulating for him to get it back into play. "Jose was furious on the touchlines. For an hour, we'd been frustrated by their clear time-wasting. "It's very frustrating for Jose to then be sent off for protesting after we have to throw the ball in within two seconds of getting it." Mourinho was last sent off in May, when still Real Madrid manager. He protested after a decision went against his team in the Copa del Rey final defeat by city rivals Atletico. He was also dismissed in 2012 against Villarreal,  and against Barcelona  in 2011. In November 2010, he was charged with unsporting behaviour by Uefa, after allegations two Real Madrid players got themselves sent off in a Champions League match. He was also sent off the season before, while managing Inter Milan against Juventus. </body>

      <title>Comedian Felix Dexter dies of cancer</title>
      <description>Tributes are paid to Felix Dexter, the comedian and actor who rose to fame on sketch show The Real McCoy, who died on Friday.</description>

      <body>Friends have paid tribute to Felix Dexter, who died on Friday. The comedian and actor had suffered from myeloma, a type of bone marrow cancer. Reports said he was 52. Colleagues and peers used Twitter to praise the St Kitts-born Londoner, with comedian David Baddiel mourning a "real loss to comedy". He came to prominence in the flagship black comedy The Real McCoy and later performed for a season with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Fellow comedian Sean Hughes wrote on Twitter: "So so sad to hear about the truly wonderful Felix Dexter passing away. "I hope you can feel the love in the comedy community fella. Rip." Bill Bailey wrote: "Very sad news about my old friend Felix Dexter. A brilliant comedian, a superb comic actor, a lovely man I feel privileged to have known." Once named Time Out comedian of the year, Dexter also featured in iconic BBC comedies The Fast Show and Absolutely Fabulous. More recently, he played three of the main roles in BBC Two's sketch show Bellamy's People and is currently appearing in Citizen Khan. His close friend, BBC Radio London presenter Eddie Nestor - who acted alongside Dexter for three years in The Real McCoy - told BBC Radio 5 Live: "It's a sad day. It's a really sad day. I went to see him and we talked and we laughed, and we laughed really hard. "This is somebody who's been diagnosed with a terminal illness and you find yourself laughing really hard, belly laughs." He added: "We've lost a talented, intelligent, articulate performer who could touch - who could reach out." The Fast Show's Paul Whitehouse acted with Dexter in Bellamy's People. Whitehouse told BBC Radio 5 live he was privileged to be close to the comedian and actor. "He was a very modest, a very private man," he said. "It was an honour to be close to him. "He stuck in people's minds, Felix. There's been such an outpouring of warmth and affection for him." Before entering comedy, Dexter studied law - something he said helped him deal with hecklers. He named Billy Connolly and the late American comics Richard Pryor and Bill Hicks among his influences, and remained on the stand-up circuit throughout his career. Later he featured in long-running staples Have I Got News You and Grumpy Old Men, as well as the influential Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge. As an actor, he had parts in Casualty and the Bill and appeared in the West End alongside Christian Slater. </body>

      <title>Philomena 'to fight R rating' in US</title>
      <description>Film producer Harvey Weinstein is to appeal against a decision by US film censors to give Philomena an R rating, according to reports.</description>

      <body>Film producer Harvey Weinstein is to appeal against a decision by US film censors to give his studio's latest film an R rating, according to reports. Philomena received the rating from the Classification and Ratings Administration for two instances of bad language. But the Weinstein Company will now officially appeal against the rating, The Hollywood Reporter said. The British Stephen Frears drama stars Dame Judi Dench and Steve Coogan. The film is based on the 2009 investigative book by BBC correspondent Martin Sixsmith about Irish-Catholic woman Philomena Lee's search for her son after being forced to put him up for adoption decades earlier. The Weinstein Company plans to release the film in the US over the Thanksgiving period next month, however it has argued the R rating will affect the number of moviegoers who could potentially watch it. The restricted R rating means people under the age of 17 may only see the film if they are accompanied by a parent or guardian. In the UK, it has been given a 12A rating by the British Board of Film Classification, where children younger than 12 years of age must be accompanied by an adult. Weinstein's studio previously became embroiled in a row with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) in 2012 over the documentary Bully over the use of bad language in the film. It opened in Los Angeles and New York without a rating, after the Weinstein Company chose to ignore the MPAA's original R rating. The studio eventually agreed to remove the language and an edited version of the film received a PG-13 rating. </body>

      <title>Tennant's Richard II rules at RSC</title>
      <description>Early reviews note David Tennant's "mesmerising" performance and "Christ-like" hair in Richard II in Stratford-upon-Avon.</description>

      <body>David Tennant's latest role sees him transformed into a king with flowing locks in the Royal Shakespeare Company's (RSC) Richard II. Early reviews have noted Tennant's "mesmerising" performance and "Christ-like" hair. Richard II is the former Doctor Who star's first RSC role since his acclaimed Hamlet five years ago. Tennant and the cast won enthusiastic applause on Thursday's opening night in Stratford-upon-Avon. The production transfers to the Barbican in London in December. It reunites Tennant with Hamlet director Gregory Doran, who is now in charge at the RSC. Starting with Richard II, Doran intends to stage each one of Shakespeare's plays once over the next six years up to 2019. Written almost entirely in verse, Richard II is a story of power and plotting in which the king's weakness and vanity threatens to drag his people into a civil war. In the cast alongside Tennant are Michael Pennington as John of Gaunt, Nigel Lindsay as Henry Bolingbroke, Oliver Ford Davies as the Duke of York and Jane Lapotaire as the Duchess of Gloucester. The play opens with a funeral lament sung live by a small choir, after which Tennant's smooth-chinned, long-haired Richard arrives in a flowing white robe, in sharp contrast to those around him in chain-mail or mourning black. In another scene he preens his rock-star locks in a mirror. "His hair takes some getting used to," notes The Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish. "Great gingery-brown extensions trail girlishly downwards. Long, magisterial, quasi-medieval robes add to the effeminate impression. "With his startled eyes and concentrated frown, Tennant is frail, pale and consistently interesting but the nervous energy he excels in is confined to quarters early on." Tennant gives a "mesmerising performance that grows in power as Richard's authority declines," according to Michael Billington in The Guardian. "The packed houses for this production's run in both Stratford and at the Barbican may have much to do with Tennant's star presence. But this is the strongest company the RSC has fielded in years." The Independent's Paul Taylor called it "another palpable hit for the Tennant/Doran collaboration". Recent star-name portrayals of Richard II include Eddie Redmayne at the Donmar Warehouse in 2011 and Ben Whishaw's Bafta-winning TV performance in the BBC's The Hollow Crown last year. Tennant told The Independent recently Richard II was a play he had loved since drama school when he saw a production with Sir Derek Jacobi. "It's quite unknowable," he said. "There are no heroes and villains in it, just people trying their best and not managing to get on with their lives." Tennant's association with the RSC goes back to 1996 when, aged 25, he played Touchstone in As You Like It. His other RSC appearances include Romeo and Juliet, The Comedy of Errors, Love's Labour's Lost and The Rivals. By the time he played the Prince of Denmark in Doran's modern-dress Hamlet in 2008, Tennant was a household name because of his lead role in Doctor Who. Tennant's last Shakespearean stage role was Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing in the West End in 2011, alongside his former Tardis companion Catherine Tate as Beatrice. He will be appearing alongside Matt Smith in the Doctor Who 50th anniversary story, The Day of the Doctor, on BBC One on 23 November. Richard II is at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until to 16 November and at the Barbican Theatre, London, from 9 December to 25 January. It will be broadcast live on 13 November to cinemas across the UK. </body>

      <body>"Pre-Salt". A term that hardly anyone outside oil industry would have ever heard of and, even if they had, it holds few clues as to what it really is. But those two incongruous, single-syllable words hold the key to Brazil's hopes of becoming a major oil producer, securing billions of dollars in revenue and helping to boost a faltering economy. Not far off the coast of Rio de Janeiro State, and just to the north east of the famous coastal city is the area in question. It is an almost unimaginably large oil deposit; 1,500 sq km (579 sq miles) and 326m (1,070ft) deep. Although it lies well beneath the sea bed, under a thick layer of rock and salt, the find is said to be relatively risk-free. Estimates vary but it could hold as many as 12bn barrels of oil. The find has been called "Libra" and Brazil is about to auction off the rights to develop the site, with some pretty tight strings attached. Magda Chambriard is the Director General of Brazil's National Oil Agency. For her it's a win-win situation. We discussed Libra and its implications for Brazil as a global oil producer, in her Rio de Janeiro headquarters. She dismissed, with a wry smile, suggestions the country didn't have the experience or infrastructure to cope with such a huge undertaking as the development of the Libra field. "Everything is very well planned. There are new platforms, new pipelines, more infrastructure," said the woman who trained as an oil engineer but is now one of the most powerful figures in the industry. "Everything here in Brazil is happening in the correct way so we are very confident that everything will be OK." Just to the north of Rio de Janeiro, the once small fishing village of Macae is the closest land point to the offshore fields. It's not quite El Dorado but property prices here are already among the highest in the country and these days the noise of helicopters ferrying workers out to the existing rigs is much louder than the chug of fishing boats around the mangroves. Realising the urgent need for able workers if Brazil is to make the most of its impending oil boom, the local authority here is training hundreds of people to work on the rigs. Many are migrant workers from other parts of Brazil, like 32 year-old Claudia, who is learning to be a skilled welder. "Where I'm from, up in Bahia, sadly there's no work - it's all down here," Claudia tells me. "The training lasts three to four months and I'm now in the final stages. But it's free and I'm actually working in the company where I expect to get a job." According to Claudia at least half of the people in her own north-eastern village have made the long journey south, hoping for a well-paid job, like hers, in the oil sector. When the bidding process for the Libra auction was announced, there was considerable surprise that several major oil producers, including BP, the BG Group, Exxon and Chevron, decided not to enter. All are involved quite heavily in other parts of Brazil's diverse energy sector but many analysts say the high proportion of profits being demanded by the Brazilian government and strict conditions of the lease had persuaded some companies to turn their backs on Libra. Brazil has made it clear it expects to keep somewhere in the region of 70% of the profits from the Libra field. Whoever wins the bidding will certainly be looking at long, not short-term returns as developing the find will require at least $200bn (£123bn). Oh, and there's a one-off, up-front bonus payment of $5bn to the Brazilian government in return for winning the auction as well. Nonetheless, there are hundreds of small and medium foreign firms doing very well on the back of Brazil's oil boom. Companies like the British-owned Swire Group, which has plenty of offshore experience in other deep-water environments, specialises in providing containers and cabling for the industry. Swire now employs about 50 people at its plant in Macae. They will soon be moving to new, bigger premises on the other side of town and hope to increase their workforce four-fold in the next five years. "You have to approach this from a Brazilian perspective," says Marcelo Nacif, Swire's local general manager. "You have to have local people who understand the culture and the bureaucracy and you have to adapt." The bottom line, says Mr Nacif, is that specialist companies like his have to go where the oil is and, for now, that's Brazil. "The North Sea is on the down side, right?" he asks rhetorically. "Every day there's less oil, less gas there so if those companies don't look at South America and Africa in the future their business is going to shrink." There is still a highly protectionist and barrier-driven nature to doing business in Brazil and some here object to the involvement of foreign businesses, in any way whatsoever, in the Libra bidding process. Workers from Brazil's state-run oil company, Petrobras, have just gone out on strike over the issue and their demand for bigger salaries. But, say many analysts, their arguments are difficult to comprehend. Brazil just doesn't have the capacity or ability to develop Libra on its own, certainly not to its full potential. Furthermore, under the straight-jacket Brazil is forcing the winning bidder to wear, is a stipulation that Petrobras must share 30% of the new venture and be allowed to operate all of the rigs in the new field. Oil has always proved to be a blessing and a curse. On the impoverished fringes of Macae, only 10% of the residents have basic sewage facilities, crime is rampant but some improvements are finally being made to people's lives by the local authority. President Dilma Rousseff has promised to divert all of Brazil's petroleum revenues back into social services and public works but what Brazil does with the windfall from the Libra auction will be watched very closely here. </body>

      <title>Managing the worst team in the world</title>
      <description>Meet the manager of the world's worst football team</description>

      <body>Waking up on an island of crystal blue lakes, turquoise seas and tropical temperatures each morning sounds like paradise. But rather than relaxing in a hammock all day in his adopted home of the Turks and Caicos Islands, 41-year-old Englishman Matthew Green is busy trying to rid the country of the title 'world's worst football team'. It's a distinction they share with Bhutan and San Marino at joint 207th place in the Fifa world football rankings. The task isn't easy, as Green's team last won in 2008 (against St Lucia) and haven't actually played a match for two years because of a shortage of players. His squad includes a variety of occupations, including a policeman, lawyer, teacher and construction worker. Add the fact that his only other managerial experience is with a pub team in Hull and you get an idea of how tough his job is. "Everybody thinks you are sat on the beach drinking pina coladas," Green says. "I wish I was, but there is too much to do. "I did once take a pub side in Hull, called Spiders, to a Sunday League title. But that was a bit different to running an international team. "Every time I go back to Hull, my brother and friends make fun of the fact we are ranked so low. I know they are only joking but there is pride there. You want to see your country rise up the rankings. "We are certainly capable of doing so, if we can get some extra resources." The Turks and Caicos Islands is a British territory made up of 40 Caribbean islands - eight are inhabited - covering an area of 166 square miles. The overall population is about 30,000, one third of whom are under 15. As technical director of their football association, Green is responsible for overseeing all aspects of football development, from working with the men's and women's national teams to the youth set-up, coaching and refereeing. The island's league has six amateur teams, yet most of the players are expats meaning Green has a pool of fewer than 25 players to choose from. There are some talented youngsters, but they tend to be on scholarships in America and the UK, making it difficult to return for matches or training camps. One of the few professionals available is Gavin Glinton, 34, who plays for Vietnamese second division club Mikado Nam Dinhis. He is the country's all-time top goalscorer, with four goals in eight international matches. "The players are great to deal with, for the most part," says Green, one of three full-time football employees. The island's FA was formed in 1996 and became affiliated to Fifa two years later. Back then they had no pitches, no leagues, and had to wait until 2006 for their first win - against the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean Cup. So how did a former teacher from Hull become their manager? Green was released by Hull City at the age of 15 for being too small and went on to qualify as a teacher. He arrived in the Bahamas in 1998 trying to find a job at a school. The search was fruitful and he turned Temple Christian High School into one of the major powerhouses of Bahamian football, with the senior high girls team winning the national championship every year from 2001 to 2007. At the same time he also started to work his way up the national coaching ladder. He was also an active player, finishing top scorer for Grasshoppers FC in 2000 and 2001. In 2007, he spotted an advert for technical director of the Turks and Caicos Islands FA and decided to give it a go. He landed the job and discovered an island of beautiful beaches and average summer temperatures of 29C. It's little surprise that celebrities such as Hollywood actor Bruce Willis and England defender Rio Ferdinand have splashed out on properties there in recent years. Green lives on his own in a two-bedroom house surrounded by natural vegetation, overlooking lakes and hills. A balcony provides picture-perfect views. After 15 years in the Caribbean he feels at home, although traces of his heritage are revealed from time to time. "My accent varies depending on who I am talking to," he says. "I have a 'coaching voice' which is a bit of a 'put on', but it makes sure all our players can understand me. "My Hull accent comes out when I get angry or excited - which is quite often!" The islands haven't played since their 10-0 aggregate defeat to the Bahamas in a World Cup qualifier in 2011. Green is determined to hold a couple of friendlies in the coming months, ahead of their 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign in the Concacaf group. And he's sure there are reasons for optimism. "Within a few years we have managed to put together a pretty strong youth programme and our grassroots programme is pretty big," he says. "We now have over 20 leagues and competitions across all ages and sexes. A few years ago we had three. "It has not been easy, but it has become the most popular sport in the country at youth level. Track and field, softball and basketball are still very popular but, in terms of numbers, football is well ahead now. "A new 5,000-capacity stadium was built the other year thanks to Fifa funding, while we now have more than 500 youngsters registered to our youth programmes compared to less than 100 when I first started." Maybe he can even get the islands off the dreaded bottom spot in the rankings, which really would be reason for celebration. </body>

      <title>How to rebuild the Republican brand</title>
      <description>Get an Angela Merkel, and other advice for US Republicans</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24574589</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70575000/jpg/_70575498_bushflag.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>The Republican Party drew its lowest approval ratings in history during the US government shutdown and debt ceiling impasse. Political strategists offer five recommendations for how to rebuild the party's brand. Republican strategist Ford O'Connell notes the party cites popular two-term US President Ronald Reagan, in office 1981-89, on an array of issues. But more than two decades after Reagan left office, the late president is not doing the party any favours, he says. "Ronald Reagan is dead and they need to accept it," says O'Connell. O'Connell suggests that instead of inspiring positive associations in voters' minds, invoking Reagan actually "prevents modern Republicans from articulating a 21st Century agenda". Republican strategist Tom Rath says Reagan, an "icon" of the party, would not be the same figure today as when he was president in the 1980s. "His presidency was a presidency for the times, and times change," he says. "Ronald Reagan didn't have to deal with Twitter or the internet; things are different now." "To say we have to do exactly what Reagan did, that belies the inevitable change in the character of the American people and the issues that are on the table." And Republican strategist John Feehery says, "He was conservative, but he's not nearly as conservative as these guys [in Congress] now." "We need someone who can be tough but also exhibit common sense and be practical," says Feehery, who cites the current chancellor of Germany. Feehery says the Republican Party lacks a strong cadre of women, and one woman in particular who can assume a senior role in the current "patriarchal" congressional leadership. Republicans need a "Sarah Palin with brains," jokes Feehery of the former Republican vice-presidential candidate, who later resigned as governor of Alaska for a career as a professional conservative figurehead and speechmaker. The Republican strategist says women in Congress helped soothe tensions behind the scenes during the 16-day government shutdown and debt limit deadlock. Republican Senator Susan Collins in particular has been recognised for her role in facilitating successful negotiations between Senate leaders of both parties. "If there is anything to be heartened by over the last few weeks, it is the emergence of Susan Collins," Rath says. Collins and other women Republican senators "found a way to get to [an ideological] middle and at least stop the train wreck from happening," he added. As more US states legalise same-sex marriage, Republicans can no longer remain so staunchly opposed to it, O'Connell argues. Gay marriage is growing in popularity nationally, he says, and Republicans must recognise their fierce opposition hurts them with younger voters. "There is a large recognition that among right-leaning independents and Republicans under 40 that it's a fact of life and it's here to stay," he says. Feehery says Republicans are not yet ready to embrace same-sex marriage, but leaving opposition to it out of the party message could prove successful over the long term. "I think we'd be better off not talking about it," he says. Republicans have taken the blame for shutting down the government in an attempt to defund President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reform law, known as Obamacare. But Republican strategists argue that Republicans must move beyond just denigrating Democratic proposals if they want to improve their brand among voters. "You win more elections by saying what you're for than what you're against," says Rath. Feehery asks, "What is their governing philosophy other than tearing stuff down? How do you build stuff up and does the party want you to build stuff up?" Complicating the matter, the party base "doesn't have any trust in government", Feehery says. "There's a big mood amongst the Tea Party... and conservative Republicans that they don't want accomplishments," Feehery says. "They don't want government to get bigger, they don't want new laws, they don't want anything. "Unless you're talking about getting rid of Obamacare or repealing some other laws, they don't want to talk to you. And that's problematic because their job as legislators is to pass laws and get things done." Feehery advises the party to focus on immigration reform, a budget deal, and reforms of the food aid programme, for example. "Try to get stuff done," he says. The partial government shutdown made it clear the Republican Party has been cleaved into two factions, so-called moderate establishment Republicans and more strident Tea Party Republicans pushing for confrontation. More moderate figures were seen on talk shows lambasting their more right-wing brethren, while Tea Party members threatened intra-party challenges against those in Congress they viewed as not toeing the party line. "They have to improve their communication strategy," O'Connell says. "Most Americans don't know a heck of a lot about policy or where either of the parties stands, but what they do know is tone and language, and if Republicans don't take a more appealing moderate tone and use less fire-and-brimstone rhetoric, they're never going to expand the tent of voters." The Republican strategist also argues that the party must move beyond the Washington lexicon in order to appeal to those outside the political bubble. "They have to do a better job of a sales pitch and they also have to better explain their positions," O'Connell claims. "They assume people know things about different budget issues or what's going on, and they really don't." He says former Republican President George W Bush connected with the public on a folksy level, and others in his party should take note. So, party leaders should dispense with all the budget talk with appearances on late-night comedy programmes. "You're not a hack by watching your words," O'Connell says. "That doesn't mean compromise your principles, it's just that so much more can be accomplished through perception than in actual policy positions." "The Republicans will know they've hit the right balance when people want to have a beer with them, and right now they don't." </body>

      <title>Peek-a-boo: A window on baby's brain</title>
      <description>What a baby's sense of humour can tell us about their brains</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24553877</url>

      <body>A baby's first smile is an exciting moment. But what can it tell us about their understanding of the world? Boasting about the speed of childhood development is the sport of choice for many a doting parent. From the 12-week scan right through the early years, monitoring the physical and mental progress of their pride and joy is a source of both excitement and concern. Especially rewarding is the onset of smiles, squeals and laughter - the kind of milestones that make all the disturbed nights worth it. But is it all just wind? Apparently not, as researchers now think that laughter and games like peek-a-boo could be telling us something more, and giving us a way to peer inside the workings of their minds. "Laughter and smiles start incredibly early, just like tears," says Dr Caspar Addyman, a baby laughter researcher at Birkbeck College in London. "So this leads us to think that it's a form of communication," he told the BBC. Dr Addyman has collected nearly 700 questionnaires about baby smiles and laughter from around the world. He found that babies are smiling in response to pleasant feelings much earlier than expected, which can be as young as one month old. Soon after that, at between two to four months, social smiles develop that are used specifically to engage the parents. He now hopes to take the research further and use laughter as a new way of tracking what it is that babies understand about the world around them. The person who most greatly influenced our current view of childhood development was Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Careful observations of children at different ages led him to identify four stages that everyone must go through to reach the cognitive abilities of an adult (see box). In the earliest months of life, Piaget said that babies are only able to learn about the world by directly interacting with it through grasping, shaking and sucking. With each experience, he concluded, children gradually build up a picture of how the world works - a kind of naïve physics. But Dr Addyman thinks that studying babies' laughter can be just as effective at helping us pinpoint developments in the way their minds are expanding. "You can't laugh at something until you get the joke, so what they laugh at really tells us about their understanding of the world," says Addyman. As a result of having experienced so little, small children are for the most part quite content to accept the absurd as completely plausible. Dr Addyman, who sports a crop of bright blue hair, sees this regularly with his young volunteers. "Young babies would never laugh at my hair. But older children realise there's something wrong and that makes it funny." The ability of children to suddenly see the funny side, Dr Addyman believes, acts to highlight much more profound developments going on deep inside their brains. The Baby Laughter Project, which has surveyed parents from more than 20 countries, has shown that games like peek-a-boo are perfect for showing one such fundamental development - object permanence. The term describes the understanding that an object still exists, even if you can't see it. Very young children don't know this, which is why babies under around six months can look shocked and startled at peek-a-boo. They think that not being able to see mum or dad's face means that they've actually disappeared, making their sudden reappearance comes as quite a surprise. However once a child understands (at around six- to eight-months old) that their parent is just hiding, then peek-a-boo becomes all about the anticipation of when they're going to come back. "Peek a boo is all the best things. It's mummy reappearing, but it's also about shared communication," says Dr Addyman. "You can't help but smile and laugh when a baby starts laughing with you, which is really valuable for them developing their ability to interact with other people." A potential link between laughter and language development suggests we've thus far underestimated babies' sense of humour. Joking requires an element of taking turns as well as other skills needed for advanced interaction, like imitation and eye-contact. "Children can pick up the rhythms of conversation through joking and playing games," says Dr Addyman. In fact, smiles and laughter could be important communication tools for infants before they develop language. Even primates seem to use laughter as a way of regulating social interaction. "Laughter in chimps is predominantly used in play and it tends to be the youngest members of the group who have time for playing," says Dr Katie Slocombe, a primate cognition specialist at the University of York. "It's been shown in chimps that laughter facilitates extended play, and we can't rule out that it has some sort of role in social bonding. When a chimp laughs, it seems to encourage their play partner to continue tickling or chasing them - just like a baby keeping an adult's attention for longer," she told the BBC. So should we try harder to interpret the deeper meaning in those burbles and titters? Dr Addyman suggests a certain level of caution. "Historically, we've certainly been guilty of projecting adult interpretations about what babies are laughing at, and it's a constant danger when doing this kind of research," he says. "You really have to look at this scientifically and at a range of ages to really start to understand what's going on in their heads." </body>

      <body>Singapore has achieved what only a handful of countries have - joining the so-called First World from the developing world. The city-state transformed itself from a British colonial outpost into the country with the third highest average income in the world within a matter of decades. Not only that, it has become an international financial centre attracting expatriates from across the globe. Foreign workers make up 40% of Singapore's labour market. Exporting consumer electronics has been the driver of growth for Asia since the 1960s, including for Singapore, which has also made the most of one of its few natural advantages, a deep water sea port. For Working Lives, the BBC's Linda Yueh has been meeting people around the island. Wang Han, a young Singaporean design engineer, is the type of highly skilled worker that leads international companies to set up plants in such an expensive country. She works on the innovative digital motor that powers hand dryers and vacuum cleaners for UK company Dyson. The motor is made in Singapore, but the products using it are assembled in Malaysia and sold around the world. That international outlook and the government's promotion of skilled workers also attracts foreigners to Singapore. Frazer Macdonald Hay came to teach young Singaporeans how to integrate design into engineering. He heads a 10-year programme between the Glasgow School of Art and Singapore's Institute of Technology. Chris Gill was attracted by the government's promotion of the financial sector, and a safe, clean environment to bring up his young family. He heads a global insurance company's Asian headquarters based in Singapore. Property developer Satinder Garcha, who according to one survey is Singapore's 46th richest person, plays polo each afternoon in the middle of the city, giving him a rather enviable work-life balance. But it's not just the rich who have a good standard of living. Office cleaner Liew Siew Giok works all day on her feet but goes home to a meal cooked by her Burmese maid. She lives with her extended family, who pay for the domestic help and her flat. The influx of foreigners has created social tensions and the rapid growth of the financial sector has raised some concerns about the future. However, what is clear is that Singapore has grown by being at the leading edge of know-how, giving not just the rich, but most people, a good quality of life. </body>
